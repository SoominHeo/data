Her story touches on the obliviousness people have toward the fact that their moms are women, and not just mothers. Her identity as a person vanishes and her desires as an individual are put aside for the sake of her children. 
Reading the book, readers can’t help but thinking about their own moms and realize how grateful they are for the sacrifices she made for the family.
