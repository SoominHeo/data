Snow tubing fun at Everland’s ‘SnowBuster’
With the start of winter holidays, many people struggle to find a fun way to pass the time. This winter, why not spend a day at Samsung Everland’s popular snow tubing park, “SnowBuster”?
As one of the biggest snow tubing parks in Korea, Everland’s “SnowBuster” has a lot to offer for people of any age, whether you go with family or friends. 
Since 2011, the snow tubing park at Everland has made a few changes to make the experience much more enjoyable. In addition to extending the length of the tubing courses, “tube lifts” have been installed to make the return to the top less of a hassle. 
The courses
There are three different courses to choose from at Everland’s snow tubing park, the longest of which is 200 meters long. 
Once you reach the top of the 200-meter-long Eiger course, you can choose between riding a one-person tube or a two-person tube. Though riding alone may be more fun for some people, those who pick the two-person tube can enjoy an extra little thrill of an automatic departure system. 
While other courses feature a “tube lift” to make going back up the hill easier, the two-person ride at the Eiger course has the added bonus of an automatic departure system. Rather than getting off the lift once you reach the top, it will automatically send you back down the slope without having to get up at all. 
Another great perk of the new “tube lifts” is not having to keep track of your tube. Once you come down from the top, you can merely just hop on one of the empty tubes attached to the lift and ride your way back up again. 
The “SnowBuster” snow tubing park is located in the “Alpine Village” of Samsung’s Everland. 
Tired of having to haul your tube back up the slope after a quick ride down? Not to worry! The “tube lift” makes going back up that much easier and less painful. All you need to do is sit back and relax while the lift takes you back up the hill for another exhilarating ride down the slopes.
