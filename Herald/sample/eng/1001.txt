Conjoined twins successfully separated
Twin girls, Allison June and Amelia Lee Tucker, who were joined at the lower chest and abdomen for more than nine months, were introduced to the public at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on Dec. 27 after successfully being separated. 
Wearing animal-striped shirts and flowered headbands, the twins looked healthy and alert. The girls’ parents, Shellie and Greg Tucker from Adams, New York, held each girl by their arms.
Doctors said that Allison’s recovery was faster than that of Amelia, the larger of the two. They told reporters that Amelia needs more treatment at the hospital into the New Year. 
“We totally expect them to have full, independent lives,” said pediatric surgeon Dr. Holly Hedrick. 
The twins shared a chest wall, diaphragm, liver and pericardium, the membrane around the heart, making it a tricky surgery, AP stated. A team of 40 medics took part in the complex seven-hour operation on Nov. 7.
The girls’ mother, Shellie Tucker found that she was carrying conjoined twins 20 weeks into her pregnancy. “It was a roller coaster ride,” she said recalling the past year. 
A series of medical tests, including ultrasound imaging and MRI, gave hope that girls have a good chance of survival after operation. Now that her daughters are doing so well she said that she felt relieved. “The burden is completely gone, and I am very, very happy.”
The surgery was the 21st successful separation of conjoined twins performed at the hospital. The first was held in 1957. 
According to the hospital’s statistics, conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births. About 70 percent of them are female.
