Listening to music online to cost more
Disappointing news if you enjoy listening to music online. Now you will have to pay more when you want to hear music files online, but in the long run it could be better for everyone, since the measure is aimed at protecting intellectual property rights.
The monthly fee for listening to music online is expected to more than double in 2013, The Korea Herald reported on Dec. 26.
According to the report, the nation‘s largest online music service portal Melon decided to raise its current 3,000 won monthly plan, which provides unlimited access to listen to its music, to 6,000 won.
The company that runs Melon service said that the new rates would be applied from Jan. 1. Melon now boasts 18 million registered users.
The rate increase came part of the government’s plan to ensure patent rights and higher margins for musicians and patent holders, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
As Melon is ready to raise its fees, rival companies are expected to follow suit.
One of them, KMP Holdings, also said that it was in the final process of discussing new charges.
The Korea Herald quoted experts who expected that online music providers Bugs, Mnet and CJ E&M Corp would eventually also join the move.
