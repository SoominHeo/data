Choo Shin-soo traded to Cincinnati Reds
The Cleveland Indians recently traded Choo Shin-soo to the Cincinnati Reds in a three-team, nine-player deal. Choo is expected to hit in the leadoff spot and play center field for the Reds. In his 7-year Major League career, Choo has done well as a leadoff hitter, but he has limited experience playing center field. By moving from the struggling Indians (68 wins ? 94 losses in 2012) to the surging Reds (97 wins ? 65 losses in 2012), Choo joined a team with excellent prospects for making the playoffs. 
For Cleveland, trading away the productive and popular Choo is a strategic move made out of necessity. The 30-year-old Choo is eligible for free agency in 2013, and his agent Scott Boras has repeatedly turned down several contract extension offers from the Indians. For Cincinnati, acquiring Choo addressed one of the team’s glaring weaknesses in the batting lineup. Choo had a .283 batting average and a .389 on-base percentage in the 98 games he led off last season, while the Reds‘ leadoff hitters batted just .254. Choo’s ability to get on base and steal bases will likely make the Reds’ already potent offense even more dangerous. 
Choo Shin-soo joined the American League club Cleveland Indians in 2006 and played 45 games at the Major League level that year. He missed several months of the 2007 season due to injury and had season-ending Tommy John surgery on his left elbow. Choo had an outstanding season in 2009. He became the first Asian player to join the 20-20 club (hitting 20 homeruns and stealing 20 bases). He finished the season with 20 home runs, 21 steals, 86 RBIs, and a .300 batting average. In 2010, he achieved 20-20 again and added sound defense to his repertoire. He led the American League right fielders in assists with 14. Choo was beset by various injuries in 2011 and his performance suffered greatly. He returned to form in 2012 and put up respectable numbers. 
Choo Shin-soo’s new team, the Cincinnati Reds, is in the National League. It resides in the Central Division with St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The Reds are one of the oldest and the most honored franchises in the Major Leagues. Founded in 1881 and joining the National League in 1890, the Reds are the oldest major league club to have played continuously in one city. The venerable ball club has won ten division titles, nine National League pennants, and five World Series titles. The team’s home stadium is the 42,319-seat Great American Ball Park.
The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series in 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976 and 1990. During the 1970s the Reds were the most dominating team in baseball. Nicknamed The Big Red Machine, the club was managed by the legendary Sparky Anderson and featured future Hall of Fame players like baseball’s all-time hits leader Pete Rose, 14-time all-star and two-time MVP Johnny Bench, and 10-time all-star and five-time Gold Glove winner Joe Morgan. In the 1975 season, Cincinnati won 108 regular season games and went on to defeat the Boston Red Sox in seven games to win the World Series. In 1976, the Reds swept the New York Yankees in four games and won a second consecutive World Series title.
The Cincinnati Reds have been on the rise in recent years. The team won the Central division title in 2010 and 2012. The new crop of star players include the 2010 National League MVP Award and the National League Hank Aaron Award winner Joey Votto, the 2012 Silver slugger Award winner Jay Bruce, the 2012 Wilson Defensive Player of the Year winner Brandon Phillips, and the man who holds the fastest recorded pitch speed in MLB history at 169.1 kilometers per hour - Aroldis Chapman.
