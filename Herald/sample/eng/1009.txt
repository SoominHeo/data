Power runs in the family
Park Chung-hee was an army general who seized power in 1961 through a military coup d’état and ruled as “president for life” until his assassination in 1979. Thirty-three years after his death, his daughter Park Geun-hye was elected as president of Korea, thus becoming the second member of her family, and the first female in Korean history, to become the nation’s head of state. Throughout the world, there are other examples of members of the same family being elected or ascending to the highest office in the land. 
In the United States, there were two sets of father-son presidents. John Adams, one of the founding fathers of the nation, first served as the vice president to George Washington, then as the second president of the nation for one term from 1797 to 1801. His son, John Quincy Adams, served as the sixth president of the United States, also for one term, from 1825 to 1829. George Herbert Walker Bush served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Prior to that, he was a congressman, an ambassador, the director of the CIA, and the vice president of the United States. His son, George Walker Bush, served two terms as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. The junior Bush was a businessman and the governor of Texas before he became the president.
In India, the Nehru family stood out as the world’s oldest democratically elected political dynasty. It produced a tandem of grandfather-daughter-grandson prime ministers that ruled for 37 of the nation’s 53 years as an independent state. Jawaharlal Nehru served as the prime minister of India from 1947-1964. His daughter Indira Gandhi served three terms from 1966-1977, and again for a fourth term from 1980-1984, until her assassination on Oct. 30, 1984. Rajiv Gandhi, Indira’s son, took office the day after his mother’s death and became the youngest prime minister in India’s history at age 40. On May 21, 1991, he was assassinated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
In the Philippines, Corazon Aquino, the widow of the assassinated Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., led the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled Ferdinand Marcos. In February 1986, she was elected as the 11th President of the Philippines and became the first woman to hold that office, and the first female president in Asia. She survived several coup attempts and served out her term in 1992. She died of colorectal cancer on Aug. 1, 2009. On June 30, 2010, her son Benigno Aquino III was sworn into office as the 15th president of the Philippines. 
In Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto served as the nation’s fourth president from 1971 to 1973, and ninth prime minister from 1973 to 1977. On July 5, 1977, he was ousted in a military coup led by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Bhutto was charged with the murder of Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a politician and lawyer, and executed by hanging on April 4, 1979. His daughter, Benazir Bhutto, became the 11th prime minister of Pakistan in December of 1988. Her government was dismissed in November of 1990 on charges of corruption. She came back and won a second term as the prime minister was extended in October of 1993, but her government was dismissed once again in 1996 for corruption. She was assassinated on Dec. 27, 2007 at a campaign rally. 
In North Korea, the position of the head of state is truly a family affair. Kim Il-sung was the supreme leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994. What followed was the first dynasty in the communist world. His eldest son Kim Jong-il succeeded him as the nation’s leader from 1994 until his death in December 2011. Kim Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il and the grandson of Kim Il-sung, became the new supreme leader of North Korea on Dec. 17, 2011.
