Singer Rain in military service row
Shortly after the news of a romantic relationship between actress Kim Tae-hee and K-pop icon Rain surfaced on the first day of 2013, Rain faced harsh criticism over his violation of military service rules. 
Kim Tae-hee admitted on Jan, 1 that she had been dating mega-star Rain for a month. 
“They have favorable feelings and are getting to know each other,” her agency said in a statement. 
Yet, media reports that the couple met over the past four weeks while he was still on military duty raised questions over possible preferential treatment to the singer. Usually, during their military service, Korean men are confined to their barracks and given little free time. 
Paparazzi shots also showed the singer driving a private car in military uniform, and not wearing his army beret while dating Kim. 
Thousands signed an online petition calling for an investigation of the case. The Defense Ministry says Rain broke military service guidelines and ordered his battalion to issue disciplinary measures to the singer. 
“Corporal Jung Ji-hoon went out to practice (songs) as part of his official duties and he had private contacts (with Kim). Private contacts are seen as a violation of service rules,” the ministry announced.
Entertainers have been known to dodge military service, which has provoked great anger among many Korean men who must serve two-year military service.
The ministry revealed that Rain spent 71 days off duty last year, much more than the average of 43 days given to ordinary soldiers during the same period.
Rain has been serving as “entertainer soldier,” appearing on military run-TV and radio to boost soldiers’ morale. His military service ends in July.
