Indonesian city to forbid women from ‘straddling motorbikes’
A city in the Indonesian province of Aceh which follows Sharia, or Islamic law, has ordered city’s female passengers not to straddle motorbikes behind drivers.
Suaidi Yahya, mayor of Lhokseumawe, argued women passengers are only allowed to sit “side-saddle,” not straddle with each leg on different sides because it violates Islamic values.
It will “save people‘s morals and behavior,” he stated. “When you see a woman straddle, she looks like a man. But if she sits side-saddle, she looks like a woman.” 
According to BBC news report, leaflets about the recent regulation have already arrived in government offices to inform residents. The local government says it will evaluate the regulation in a month and turn it into a by-law.
“Once it has become a by-law, automatically there will be sanctions,” the mayor explained. This means women who do not follow the rule would face punishment.
On safety, mayor insisted that passengers who sit side-saddle rarely fell off while riding motorbikes.
The regulation has brought about harsh criticism from Muslim activists such as Ulil Abshar Abdalla. 
“How to ride a motorbike is not regulated in Sharia. There is no mention of it in the Koran or Hadiths,” he said on his Twitter account. “In a democratic country, what is claimed to be Sharia must be assessed by the public’s common sense if the government aims to turn the regulation into law.”
Aceh is the only Indonesian province that follows Sharia.
The town is known for its strict regulation on residents’ way of life. Previously in October 2009, the town declared a ban on women wearing tight trousers or jeans. The same mayor who ordered the recent “straddling restriction,” warned that women who break the trouser law would be changed into a government-issued skirt and their garments be cut up.
