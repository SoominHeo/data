Surgeons successfully separate twin girls joined at the head
On Sept. 18, officials at Londonâ€™s Great Ormond Street Hospital and the charity Facing the World, released a statement announcing their success in safely separating 11-month old conjoined twins Rital and Ritag Gaboura. 
Known as craniopagus twins, Rital and Ritag were born in Sudan with a rare medical condition in which their heads were joined together. This occurs in only about one in 2.5 million births. 
Facing the World, a charity which helps disfigured children, helped fund the four-stage operation required to separate the twins safely.
