Hotel Transylvania
Even monsters need a vacation, and there is no better place for them to go to than Hotel Transylvania: a haven for monsters away from scary humans. 
The film “Hotel Transylvania” tells the story of Dracula, owner of the Hotel Transylvania, where monsters can go to relax without fear of running into humans. As he does every year, Dracula invites some of his most famous monster friends, including Frakenstein, Murray the Mummy, the Werewolf family and the Griffin the Invisible Man, to his hotel to celebrate his daughter Mavis’ birthday. 
However, Mavis, who is turning 118 - a mere teenager in vampire years - is more interested in exploring the outside world and visiting some humans than celebrating her birthday. 
Hoping to keep his daughter safe, Dracula pretends to allow Mavis to explore a nearby village. In reality, he had concocted an elaborate ruse to convince Mavis of the threat of humans. Though the plan works in scaring Mavis into returning home, it results in an unexpected visit to the hotel from a 21-year-old human traveler named Jonathan. 
With a hotel full of monster guests for his daughter’s birthday party, Dracula must somehow hide Jonathan’s true identity while also protecting Mavis from falling in love with him before it is too late.
The 3-D animation film is full of humor that appeals to both the young and old. For the Korean release, the film features voice acting from the talented and hilarious duo, Cultwo (Jung Chan-woo and Kim Tae-gyun).
“Hotel Transylvania” opens in theaters across the nation on Jan. 17.
