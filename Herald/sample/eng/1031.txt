Celebrate the cold weather at the 21st Daegwallyeong Snow Festival
One of the most popular winter festivals in Gangwon Province is back this year, the Daegwallyeong Snow Festival.
Set to take place between Jan. 19 to Feb. 5, the festival was organized to run concurrently with the 2013 Special Olympics World Winter Games in PyeongChang. Much like the Olympics, the Daegwallyeong Snow Festival was designed to be full of thrills. 
During the 18 days that the Daegwallyeong Snow Festival and the 11th Special Olympics World Winter Games are taking place, visitors to the area will have no shortage of things to see and do. 
The organizers say the Daegwallyeong Snow Festival was designed with the goal of presenting visitors with the most beautiful winter festival of their lives.
Not only will visitors have the chance to check out the famed ice and snow sculpture exhibitions, events such as the “topless marathon tournament,” hiking competition and snow mobile train ride will help make this winter unique and memorable. 
With over 15 different sections to explore, there is no shortage of fun to be had at the festival.
Those interested in trying new things can check out any of the five neighboring experience villages. The activities range from leisure sports at the Euiyajee Wind Village to feeding sheep at the Daegwallyeong Sheep Farm.
Other attractions include snow rafting, traditional snow sledding, an igloo experience, kite making, learning the traditional winter games of Gangwon Province and more.
