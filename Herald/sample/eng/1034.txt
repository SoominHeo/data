Could panda blood be next medicine?
The panda, also known as the Giant Panda, is a kind of bear native to central-western and south western China. It has distinguishable features such as black patches around its eyes and over the ears, and 99 percent of their diet consists of bamboo. 
The Giant Panda has been listed as an endangered animal and legally protected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has also categorized the animal as endangered animal species and has poured efforts into conserving it. 
Yet, there has emerged another reason to protect this adorned and rare animal from extinction. Scientists in China have discovered that the blood of panda could be a valuable source for a “next-generation antibiotic.”
In the study published in the journal Gene, scientists from the Life Sciences College of Nanjing Agricultural University in China stated that a peptide in panda blood could be synthesized to create a “powerful anti-microbial substance.”
“The cathelicidin-AM, the substance found in the blood, could be used as a drug or an anti-microbial surface cleaner,” researchers explained to the Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper.
“Under the pressure of increasing micro-organisms with drug resistance against conventional antibiotics, there is urgent need to develop new types of anti-microbial agents. Gene-encoded anti-microbial peptides play an important role in innate immunity against noxious micro-organisms. They cause much less drug resistance of microbes than conventional antibiotics,” scientist Xiuwen Yan told the paper.
What makes this finding so brilliant is that scientists do not have to harm the precious creature to get the blood, as they have already developed a way to synthesize the peptide in the laboratory.
