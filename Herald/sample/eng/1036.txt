Korean curved TVs debut in the U.S.
World's first curved OLED TVs were uncovered in Las Vegas in the United States on Jan. 9.
Samsung and LG Electronics boasted their supreme technology by revealing the curved TVs at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in the city. The electronics show is one of worlds’ largest in scale, and this year it was attended by more than 3,000 companies from 48 countries.
Samsung officials said that its 55-inch curved TV was intended to offer a more immersive viewing experience for consumers. They added that viewers could enjoy a consistent picture quality from any angle thanks to the curved panel of the TV.
Another Korean tech giant, LG Electronics also showcased its curved display panel at the same event. The company explained that its OLED TV solves the problem of screen-edge visual distortion and detail loss. LG has been receiving preorders for the TV in Korea since Jan. 2 and will be launching it in the U.S. market in March, said news reports.
The CES is a major technology-related trade show held every January in the Las Vegas Convention Center in Nevada. The first show was held in 1967 in New York City.
This year, thousands of exhibitors displayed innovative products in the categories of audio, automotive electronics, embedded technology, lifestyle electronics and more.
