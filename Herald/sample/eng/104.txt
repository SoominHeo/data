Petroleum products lead Korea‘s exports
Ships and automobiles yielded their place as number one export items to petroleum products.
 The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said late August that the total exports of petroleum products marked $5.2 billion.
 The exports of ships and cars stood at $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion,respectively, over the same period.
 The exports of petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel, surged over 95 percent from a year earlier, largely due to an oil price hike.
 Over 42 million barrels of petroleum products were shipped overseas in July, and this is a 15.5 percent increase from the previous month.
 The Knowledge Economy Ministry said in a statement that the increase in exports of petroleum products was due to rise in demand from Asian and European countries.
 In a separate statement dated Sept. 5, the ministry said that Korea’s imports and exports in August increased more than 25 percent on-year.
 It added that the increase had led to an $800 million trade surplus.
 In August, Korea’s exports increased 27.1 percent from the previous year to a record $46.4 billion, the ministry said.
 With a surge in exports of petroleum products and ships, outbound shipments of key export items increased across the board.
 Exports to most of Korea’s major trading partners went up, but the United States, the Middle East and Latin America were exceptions.
 Outbound shipments of petroleum products to the European Union shot up 663.8 percent, while exports of automobiles to China jumped 98 percent, according to the ministry.
