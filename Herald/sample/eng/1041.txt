‘The Reef 2: High Tide’
Having already once defeated the sharks in an epic battle of wits in the 2006 film, “The Reef,” an era of peace and safety has befallen the reef, where Pi and his friends live.
Pi, hero to the citizens of the reef, now spends his days swimming around happily with his wife Cordelia and son Junior. 
Unbeknownst to them, however, a naïve little bottom-feeding shark named Ronny helps Troy escape from the cage of a Navy research vessel. The same cage Pi had tricked Troy into during their battle in the last film. 
Now an even meaner, tougher and angrier Troy makes his way toward the reef to seek revenge against Pi and his friends. Taking Ronny along as prisoner, Troy gathers his gang of fellow sharks and sets off to wreak vengeance on the reef. 
Fortunately for the residents of the reef, the low tide and rock formations surrounding the reef force Troy and his friends to wait until high tide before they can gain access to the reef. This provides Pi and his friends some time to prepare for the inevitable battle. 
Will Troy and his gang of sharks finally seek revenge against Pi and destroy the reef? Or will Pi and his friends successfully defend themselves against the sharks once again?
“The Reef 2: High Tide” opened in theaters across the nation on Jan. 10. The Korean release of the film features comedians Kim Byung-man and Ryu Dam as the villain Troy and naïve Ronny, respectively, and actress Nam Bora in her first attempt at dubbing with the role of Pi’s wife, the beautiful Cordelia.
