 A glimpse into the brilliance behind Tim Burton
Offering a comprehensive look into the brilliance of director and artist Tim Burton, the highly popular Tim Burton exhibition has arrived at the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA). Seoul is the final stop following its highly successful international tour that began in New York City before heading over to Toronto, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Paris.
Marking the first time that the exhibition has traveled to Asia, the Tim Burton exhibition features a total of 860 pieces aimed at showing the talent that helped Tim Burton achieve a cult-like following around the world.
Exhibition displays include sets, costumes and other material from Tim Burton’s many popular feature films, such as the torn Catwoman costume worn by Michelle Pfeiffer in the 1992 film, “Batman Returns,” as well as drawings that the filmmaker made as a youngster growing up in Burbank, California. 
The entire exhibition documents his life as an artist, growing into the filmmaker behind films including “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Frankenweenie,” and “Dark Shadows.” In fact, the exhibition includes displays of arts, sculptures and films that even some die-hard fans won’t recognize due to their relative obscurity. 
Both fans and non-fans alike will enjoy the Tim Burton exhibition, if only to witness the brilliance of a filmmaker who redefined a genre of film with his unique style. The Tim Burton exhibition is worth checking out whether you are a fan of Tim Burton or merely a student of film. 
Running through until April 14, the exhibition is sure to entertain everyone, regardless of age, gender or nationality.
