Should there be an age limit to watch boxing?
PRO - People from babies to elders enjoy watching sports because they are exciting, fun and very competitive. However, sports such as boxing need an age limit for a couple of reasons.
First, boxing is more violent than other sports like baseball or soccer because in boxing there are two people who are punching and hitting each other.
This is surely not a scene that children should freely watch because it could damage their minds. Kids, who normally consider every person to be kind and nice, will be mentally hurt by watching two people seriously hurting each other.
Children are also quick at learning through what they watch. Without realizing it, they will become violent watching merciless punches and attacks.
So, I think there should be an age limit for watching boxing matches. If not, the games will pollute the youngsters’ minds with violence and lead the kids to resort to physical aggression thoughtlessly.
Con - People including youngsters enjoy sports for various reasons and purposes. By watching boxing, for example, they can relieve the stress of daily life and learn to acknowledge defeat.
There may be some people who think that watching boxing is hazardous to kids because it is very violent. But many sports involve some sort of physical contact. Not every sport looks peaceful and independent like ballet.
Also, fighting sports, such as boxing and martial arts, involve their own etiquettes. The athletes in the games do not fight like street fighters. Boxing is an old sport in which losers learn their weaknesses and also learn to accept the judge’s decisions.
So, by watching boxing, people including kids can find their own way of relieving stress. Also, they are given a great chance to see how to concede defeat like a real man. In that sense, I do not consider an age limit for watching boxing a very good option.
