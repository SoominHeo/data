Government to make high school free by 2017
The Education Ministry is aiming to make high-school education free for all students by 2017, government officials announced on Jan. 15.
The plan was brought up as part of President-elect Park Geun-hye’s campaign pledges to refurbish the country’s education policy.
The current education program offers free education only to students in vocational schools or from low-income families. They make up about one-third of all high-school students in Korea, according to Yonhap News.
Officials from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said the new program would provide all children aged 3-17 with free child care and education by the time Park’s term ends. 
It is an expansion of the Lee Myung-bak administration’s free child care services to all children aged 3 to 5.
The new administration also plans to adopt a new education program which will allow middle school students to take one semester off of their regular academic years to explore their future careers.
In addition to that, the president–elect suggested halving the nation’s college tuition fees. The plan is likely to reduce the burden on average Korean households. The Education Ministry explained that it would give scholarships to all students in the poorest 30 percent of the population by 2013, a year ahead of the planned schedule. 
The new ministry that will oversee the science and technology industry is about to be launched, added the report. It will focus on increasing Korea’s investment in scientific research and development to 5 percent of gross domestic product.
