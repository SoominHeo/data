Robot to try Hawaii triathlon
After it conquered the Grand Canyon and Le Mans racetrack, Reuters reported on Sept. 15 that a Japanese robot is up for a new challenge: Hawaii’s Ironman Triathlon.
 Hawaii’s Ironman Triathlon is notorious for its tough routes across the world and according to Panasonic, the electronics firm that developed the robot, it will swim, bike and run its way along the course just like the human athletes. 
 This hand-sized robot named “Evolta” consists of three different body parts and bears three rechargeable batteries on its torso, the manufacturer announced. 
 Tomotaka Takahashi, who created the green-and-white toy-like robot commented that Hawaiian Triathlon is an extremely challenging course even for top athletes, but it would be a hands-down worthy experience for Evolta. “Evolta will meet many hardships on its way, but hopefully it will overcome them all and mark the long and challenging journey with success,” he insisted. 
 In about one week -- or 168 hours, which is the time given to complete the whole process -- the Japanese robot will swim, run and bike for approximately 230 km. The amount of time provided to Evolta is set as ten times longer than the time normally given to an athlete, since it is one-tenth the size of adult men, the report pointed out.
 Mr. Takahashi explained that he had to figure out ways to make Evolta “water-proof” and have a “protection from mold.” Takahashi added that the batteries placed on the back of the robot can be recharged up to 1,800 times simply using a recharger pad. 
 The Triathlon which the Japanese robot will be participating begins on Oct. 24, after the actual Ironman World Championship for men takes place in early October. The report claimed that the triathlon Evolta is scheduled to take is going to last for seven days, non-stop.
