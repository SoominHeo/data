The cave that captures forgotten dream of ancient people
A breathtaking 3-D documentary directed by Werner Herzog, “Cave of Forgotten Dreams” leads its audience on an exclusive and unforgettable expedition into the highly inaccessible Chauvet Cave. 
The discovery of the cave in the South of France was first made in 1994. Only years ago, a select few scientists were given unprecedented access to the extraordinary interior of the cave. 
On the crystal-encrusted limestone cave, hundreds of drawings of horses, cattle, lions, rhinos and other animals were preserved in near-pristine condition. This was only possible due to the collapse of a rock face that sealed the cave off from humanity, the film’s official website explained. 
The drawings are the most ancient visual art created by man, dating back as far as 32,000 years ago. However, they were so vivid and realistic that anyone seeing those works of art could easily mistake them as alive. 
“The paintings were the primal desire of Paleolithic people to communicate,” the director Werner Herzog said.
This astonishing 3-D documentary won Best Documentary at Washington Film Critics Awards and Best Nonfiction Film at New York Film Critics Circle Awards in 2011; it was also a big hit during the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010.
