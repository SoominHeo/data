The Story 
Intent on creating a world full of ice, the evil Snow Queen goes about trying to rid the world of warmth. Eradicating physical warmth was easy enough for the queen, who uses her magical powers to cover the world in snow and ice. In order to freeze the heart and soul of people, however, the Snow Queen begins to find and destroy all artists and their successors from the world. 
The Snow Queen’s victims included the parents of Gerda and Kai, the creators of a magic mirror that could be used to destroy the queen. Despite killing Gerda and Kai’s parents, the Snow Queen could not get her hands on the magic mirror. 
After narrowly escaping the clutches of the Snow Queen, Gerda and Kai are separated as they grow up in an orphanage. Just when the two are about to be reunited, however, the Snow Queen’s minion, Orm the Troll, successfully sends Kai to the queen’s castle. 
Despite the odds being stacked against her, Gerda must now brave the cold and danger to save her brother and defeat the evil queen.
