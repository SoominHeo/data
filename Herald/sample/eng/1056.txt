 2013 PyeongChang Special Olympics World Winter Games raises curtain
The Special Olympics is the world’s largest sports event for people with intellectual disabilities.
Since its inception in 1977, it has opened every four years and the 10th event opens for eight days in PyeongChang, Gangwon province in Korea from Jan. 29 to Feb. 8. 
Unlike the Paralympics, in which physically and mentally challenged athletes participate, in this year’s PyeongChang Special Olympics, some 3,300 athletes both with and without intellectual disabilities from roughly 120 countries will take part. The event offers an invaluable opportunity to people to build friendship through sports irrespective of region, ethnicity, religion and gender - and most importantly disability. They will team up for unified sports games such as floor hockey and figure skating under the event’s grand slogan of “Together We Can.” 
Prior to the event, the famous Olympic torch, dubbed the “Flame of Hope,” was kindled in the Greek capital on Jan. 18 by 30 priestesses and 15 Special Olympics athletes. It was transported to the South Korean Embassy in Greece through the Olympic torch relay. The relay route was two kilometers long and passed through the Temple of Zeus and the Greek president’s residence. The first torch bearer was Kim Min-young, a Korean athlete with intellectual disabilities. 
The Olympic flame was then transported to a special lamp that had arrived in Korea on Jan. 19. Na Kyung-won, the head of the Special Olympics Winter Games’ organization committee, received the flame and passed it on at a torch bearing ceremony held at Gwanghwamun in central Seoul on Jan. 23. 
The Olympic flame will light the snowy fields of PyeongChang throughout the eight days of the Special Olympics.
According to the 2013 PyeongChang Special Olympics Winter Games organizers, around 2,500 volunteers, including 110 with intellectual disabilities, will also support the events throughout the journey.
