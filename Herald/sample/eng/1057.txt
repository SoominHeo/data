Consumers sue sandwich company over missing inch
The two men from New Jersey, John Farley of Evesham and Charles Pendrak of Ocean City, sued the sandwich company Subway over a one-inch short sandwich, MSNBC reported on Jan. 23. 
They posted a photo of the 11-inch Subway sandwich marketed as “Footlong” and the news immediately went viral online.
In the lawsuit, the two men called for Subway to repay losses of 5 to 8.3 percent on the several “Footlong” sandwiches they bought from the Subway store in the New Jersey area although it would only amount to about $0.41-$0.54 per sandwich. 
Calling Subway “Footlong” marketing “false, deceptive and misleading affirmative statements of fact,” they noted they are seeking class-actions on the case. 
A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Stephen DeNittis, told the New York Post that he had checked “Footlong” sandwiches from 14 different Subway locations and each fell short. “It is a relatively little fraud but the case is about holding big companies to deliver what they promised,” DeNittis insisted. “We will be investigating to find out if Subway intentionally made sandwiches smaller to profit unfairly off consumer deception.”
Subway has been marketing its sandwiches all over the world as being a foot long, meaning 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. 
With the legal action still pending, the company spokesperson released a statement saying, “We regret any instance where we did not fully deliver on our promise to our customers. We freshly bake our bread throughout the day in our more than 38,000 restaurants in 100 countries worldwide, and we have redoubled our efforts to ensure consistency and correct length in every sandwich we serve. Our commitment remains steadfast to ensure that every SUBWAY® Footlong sandwich is 12 inches at each location worldwide.”
