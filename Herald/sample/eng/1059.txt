Over half of Koreans consider themselves as poor
A recent poll showed that more than half of Korean people think that they are low-income earners.
The Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs revealed on Jan. 21 that 50.5 percent out of 1,000 people said their income was less than the national average.
About 35 percent said they belong to the group of the middle income bracket and only around 10 percent said they belonged to the high-income bracket.
The poll also showed what people’s biggest social concerns were. They were most worried about their life after retirement. The concerns that followed were education, employment and household income.
By age, people in their 20s were most concerned about employment (50.2 percent) and those in their 60s said health care was the biggest issue.
Asked about the balance between tax and welfare, 40 percent said that they would pay more tax for better welfare, while 26 percent said the government should lower taxes regardless of welfare. Meanwhile, about 25 percent said that the government should not raise taxes.
The poll also asked people what President-elect Park Geun-hye’s top priorities should be while in office. They requested Park should deal with employment, high medical costs and support for low-income earners before other things.
