Floating water
Have you ever looked up at the clouds and wondered what they’re made of?
 Well, they’re made of water -- thousands of gallons of water, floating high in the air. It’s easier to believe this when you know that cloud water takes the form of tiny droplets. The droplets are so tiny that you couldn’t see one if it was separated from all the others.
 Sometimes the water droplets join together around tiny pieces of dust in the air. These drops get bigger and bigger as more droplets collect. When they become too heavy to float, they fall -- “plop!” That’s rain!
 There are three main kinds of clouds. “Cumulus” refers to the small puffballs or great wooly-looking clouds that are flat on the bottom. “Stratus” are low clouds, usually streaky or without much shape. And “cirrus” are light feathery clouds, like the ones in the photo. Sometimes cirrus clouds are so high, where the air is very cold, that the whole cloud is made of ice. Adding “nimbus” to any of these names changes it to mean a rain cloud. Tall white cottony rain clouds are called “cumulonimbus,” or thunderheads. They often bring thunderstorms. Flat gray rain clouds are called “nimbostratus.” They usually bring only rain.
 Snow, sleet, and hail also fall from clouds. Snow and sleet fall only on cold winter days. Hailstones can fall even on a warm summer day. And you may not realize it, but you’ve probably been right inside a cloud yourself. A cloud so close to the ground that we can walk through it is what we know as “fog.”
