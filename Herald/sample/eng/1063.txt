 ‘Monsters, Inc.’ returns to the big screen bigger and better
First released in 2001, the Academy Award-winning animated comedy adventure “Monsters, Inc.” has been digitally remastered and returns to the big screen to delight audiences in 3-D. 
The Story
In a parallel world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of human children. The screams are collected at night when Scarers at Monsters, Inc. venture into children’s bedrooms to scare them using the closet doors as portals. This job is considered to be very dangerous because the monsters are scared of human children; they believe children to be toxic and that touching one would be fatal.
None of this deters Monsters, Inc.’s top “Scarer” James P. “Sulley” Sullivan, however, who remains dedicated to his job. 
Just shy of beating the all-time scare record, Sulley was working late at the factory one day when stumbles across the misdeeds of his biggest rival, Randall Boggs. He notices that Randall has left an activated closet door on the Scarefloor, which has allowed a human child, Boo, to enter the factory. Terrified and unsure of what to do, Sulley seeks the help of his roommate and best friend, Mike Wazowski.
Will Mike and Sulley be able to return the child back to her world safely? Or will Monstropolis forever be doomed thanks to Boo’s visit?
“Monsters, Inc.” in 3-D
The digital remastering of “Monsters, Inc.” into 3-D does nothing but improve an already-great movie by adding more depth and realism to the film’s animated characters. 
Though the 3-D elements weren’t necessary in making “Monsters, Inc.” a great film - as is evident by the film’s reception during its original, 2001 release - it does add more excitement in some of the more action-filled scenes. In particular, the chase scene through the Monsters, Inc. factory’s giant storage center for doors was made even more adrenaline-pumping in 3-D.　
“Monsters, Inc.” in 3-D will open in theaters across the nation on Feb. 7.
