Aung San Suu Kyi meets ‘Hallyu’ stars
Myanmar’s pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi took time from her busy schedule during her first visit to Korea and met actor and singer Ahn Jae-wook on Jan. 31 at Seoul’s Westin Chosun hotel.
Ahn gained stardom in the Southeast Asian nation thanks to 1997 TV drama “Star in My Heart.” Meeting with the hallyu star was arranged at Suu Kyi’s request and she revealed that Ahn reminded her of her deceased father and brother.
The meeting indicates her love for Korean culture, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry stated. Other hallyu stars she met included Lee Young-ae, who starred in TV drama “Daejanggeum,” which was a sensation in Myanmar, and Kim Hyo-jin who helped build schools and volunteered in the country with her husband and fellow actor Yoo Ji-tae.
The popularity of Korean culture began in earnest in Myanmar with 2002 Drama “Autumn in My Heart,” in which actor Song Seung-heon and actress Song Hye-kyo starred. Other numerous Korean dramas such as “Boys Over Flowers” in which actor Lee Min-ho appeared also won immense popularity.
During her five day visit to Korea, Suu Kyi attended the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang Special Olympics Winter Games, which began Jan. 29, and global development summit, where about 300 international figures discussed welfare for the intellectually disabled.
Then she visited the May 18th National Cemetery, which honors people killed in the 1980 Gwangju democracy uprising. She became the first foreign dignitary to visit the ceremony. 
The Myanmar’s opposition leader was awarded the 2004 Gwangju Prize for Human Rights, an award given in commemoration of the Gwangju democratization movement of 1980. 
Korea and Burma have agreed to build ties and begin negotiations on bilateral investments and cooperation in a wide range of areas such as energy, resource and infrastructure developments.
