Hot food sales soar during economic slowdown
Amid lengthening economic slowdown, sales of spicy food have soared in the last few months, according to retail sources.
In particular, sales of hot ramen have skyrocketed. Experts explain that people’s stress coming from economic difficulties have led them to turn to strong tastes.
According to statistics, two ramen products released by Nongshim and Paldofood were extremely popular. Their annual sales last year topped 20 billion won, respectively.
The sales trend in 2012 can be also described as a fight between “red-soup” ramens. In the previous year, ramen market sales were led by “white-soup” ramens, such as “Kokomyeon” and “Nagasaki Jjamppong.”
To fight the soaring popularity of Nongshim’s spicy ramen “Jinjjajinjja” and Paldofood‘s Namja Ramen, E-Mart also launched its own spicy ramen products late last year, according to news reports.
Meanwhile, the traditions for women to put on more lipstick and wear more short skirts during economic slowdowns have not come to fruition.
Instead of using more lipstick, female consumers chose to paint their fingernails. Relative sales have risen by over 200 percent in 2012, statistics showed.
Sales of short skirts edged up a little during the summer vacation, but looking throughout the year, no significant increase was spotted.
