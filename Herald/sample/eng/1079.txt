Fresh air goes on sale in China
China’s astonishing industrialization comes with a price: Degrading environmental conditions. The country is notorious for its dreadful air conditions, and one local entrepreneur has made the most of it by selling cans of fresh air. 
Chen Guangbiao, wealthy businessman who is reported to be worth $740 million, has come up with an idea to sell fresh air to people in China. 
Yet, his venture is not at all about profit-making, argued Chen. Instead, it is about using the product as a way to raise awareness of the declining environmental conditions in the mainland.
“If we don’t start caring for the environment, then after 20 or 30 years our children and grandchildren might be wearing gas masks and carry oxygen tanks,” he said.
The price for a can of fresh air is five yuan each (80 cents), the report added. The cans also come in different “flavors,” including “Taiwan,” “Tibet,” and “Yan’an,” the early home of the country’s Communist Party.
Chen is all about promoting for environmental causes. He recently donated 5,000 bicycles to encourage people to stop driving cars. But some say that he is too show off.
“People say I am high profile or love to stage a show, but I don’t think those who seek ‘stability’ and a low profile can do much for social progress,” he insisted.
On Feb. 1, the American Embassy in the country’s capital issued second air pollution alert as the particle count - a measure of atmospheric pollution -- reached 205, roughly 10 times of the standard level stipulated by the World Health Organization. This concerned many in the city as it could create a number of health issues, particularly for children and the elderly.
