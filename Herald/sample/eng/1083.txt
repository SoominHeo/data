Seeing everyone going away for vacation, Hongbi and Hongsi nag their mother to take them to an amusement park. Hongbi and Hongsi’s father promises to go but he cannot keep his word. Disappointed, Hongbi and Hongsi pray to the sky that they be able to fly. Then one rainy day, the two go outside and find a piece of cloud hanging on a tree. They bring it to their mother and then bake it into bread. Suddenly the bread starts to fly high up in the sky. After eating the bread, the kids and their mother begin to fly as well. Hongbi and Hongsi give the bread to their father, who missed breakfast, and eventually the whole family can fly.
