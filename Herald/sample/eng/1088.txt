Good grades are contagious
Whom you hang out with says something not only about your character but also about your academic potential, says a new study published online in the journal PLOS ONE on Feb. 13.
A number of high school students from Maine-Endwell High School in Endwell, New York participated in a research program called NetSci to find out how socializing affects students’ academic performance. 　
Students were asked to list their best friends, close friends, acquaintances and relatives, and class ranks of these people from their junior to senior years were revealed.
The study found that those who are with friends who have higher average class ranks are much more likely to see their own class rankings rise from the junior to senior year in high school. 
For instance, a student who ranked 100th in the class and has friends whose average class rank was 50th found his own rank rose about 10 to 15 spots. On the other hand, high school students who hang out with less-academic peers saw their grades fall over the same period.
“The smarter that your friends are today, there’s a higher chance for you to become smarter” in the near future, Hiroko Sayama, co-author of the study and a systems scientist at the State University of New York in Binghamton, suggested. 
The findings note that academic achievement may be contagious and travels through social circles. Friends’ study habits and peer pressure can subconsciously influence one’s academic performance, offering immense motivation. If your friend is top of the class, you might think that “I need to work harder to keep up with my friends,” Sayama, a participant of the study, said.
