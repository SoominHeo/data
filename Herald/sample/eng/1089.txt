Park Jong-woo wins long-awaited bronze
Soccer player Park Jong-woo finally received his Olympic bronze medal on Feb. 15 from the International Olympic Committee.
In the London Olympics six months ago, Park performed a controversial celebration after the Korean squad defeated Japan.
He held up a sign that read “Dokdo Is Our Territory” in celebration of Korea’s victory. Park could not attend the medal ceremony, and he was the only one from the Korean team who did not receive the bronze medal.
Six months later, the IOC decided to award the player with his medal.
The committee held a disciplinary hearing on Feb. 11 in Switzerland.
Park and Korean Olympic Committee officials attended the hearing, and the three-member IOC Disciplinary Commission held that “Park’s actions had not been intentional or premeditated.”
The IOC, however, warned Park for his behavior and called on the KOC to provide appropriate education for Korean athletes to prevent similar occurrences in future Olympic games.
The IOC Olympic Charter prohibits displays of political statements during the Olympic games.
