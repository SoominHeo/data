 ‘Day marketing’
If you missed the opportunity to give chocolate to your loved ones on Valentine’s Day, you do not need to worry since there are many other such special celebrations throughout the year.
March 14 is White Day, when men usually offer candies to women, and March 3 is Pork Belly Day when friends get together to eat Samgyeopsal.
There is also Black Day (April 14) when people who do not have a boyfriend or girlfriend eat jajangmyeon wearing black clothes, Rose Day (May 14) and Kiss Day (June 14).
The so-called “Day marketing” strategy was first sought by Japanese companies in the 1950s and 1960s.
Valentine’s Day appeared in Japan as a special occasion in the late 1950s, as the economy was picking up steam after World War II, The Sydney Morning Herald explained in its article dealing with Japanese culture of romance.
Japanese companies hit upon the idea of marketing Valentine’s Day, when a firm called Mary Chocolate began advertising Feb. 14 as “the only day of the year a woman professes her love through presenting chocolate,” according to the newspaper.
The paper further explained that March 14 was introduced years later as a way to sell gifts to men, who were told they must buy something white for ladies.
Retail outlets in both Korea and Japan tried to make the most out of these special days as sales of chocolates, candies, roses and pork soared during the period.
Most people cannot afford to celebrate all those special days by buying gifts for every occasion, but it would be great if we could mark a couple of important “days” to express our love or gratitude to the people around us.
