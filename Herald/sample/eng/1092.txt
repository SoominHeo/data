 Dogs understand human point of view
Dogs are known for their charming demeanor and loyalty to their owners; so much so that they are often referred to as “man’s best friend.” 
Dogs are loved almost universally, and owners believe, without a doubt, that their dogs reciprocate those feelings. 
But how much do dogs really understand their owners?
“Humans constantly attribute certain qualities and emotions to other living things,” Juliane Kaminski of the University of Portsmouth’s Department of Psychology said in a statement. “We know that our own dog is clever or sensitive, but that’s us thinking not them.” 
In order to discover the extent of dogs’ cognitive abilities, Kaminski and her fellow researchers set out to test whether dogs are capable of grasping humans’ point of view. 
The team’s results show that not only were dogs four times more likely to steal food if the room had been darkened, but they also took it more readily than when the room was lit. 
This suggests that dogs are aware that humans cannot see what they are doing and that they alter their behavior when they know that their owners can’t see them. 
“That’s incredible because it implies dogs understand the human can’t see them, meaning they might understand the human perspective,” Kaminski said. “The results of these tests suggest that dogs are deciding it’s safer to steal the food when the room is dark because they understand something of the human’s perspective.” 
Previous studies have shown that not only do dogs use human’s eyes as an important signal when deciding how to behave, they also respond more willingly to attentive humans than inattentive ones. This, however, is the first study to examine the role of illumination on a dog’s behavior; specifically, whether dogs differentiate between different levels of light when they develop strategies for stealing food. 
The results of this study are published in the journal Animal Cognition.
