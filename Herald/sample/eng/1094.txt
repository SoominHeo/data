Bibimbap ad steps up Korean culture drive
An advertisement for Bibimbap appeared on page 15 of the New York Times’ Feb. 13 issue, the Herald Business reported.
The ad featuring Actress Lee Young-ae in Korean traditional clothes, hanbok had a big heading “Bibimbap?” written across the top.
The advertisement was created to promote Bibimbap, one of the most popular foods in the country and to show the exquisite beauty of hanbok to the world, Seo Kyeong-deok, a professor at Sungsin Women’s University and a renowned Korean cuisine promotion specialist, pointed out.
Lee Young-ae, who gained international stardom through 2003 drama “Dae Jang Geum,” donated her talent to take part in the good cause. A number of traditional Korean foods introduced in “Dae Jang Geum” fascinated some 3 billion viewers in over 90 countries and contributed to the rising global interest for the Korean food and culture.
“As Lee Young-ae starred in the drama ‘Dae Jang Geum,’ I hoped to introduce Bibimbap in a friendly way,” professor Seo who designed the ad explained. “We wanted to take a closer approach to reach more people, because ‘Dae Jang Geum’ was viewed by over 300 million people all over the world.”
Bibimbap ads have been put up on the Times Square billboard in New York more than 500 times. The efforts to spread the Korean culture and promote the traditional dish to the world keep carrying on.
