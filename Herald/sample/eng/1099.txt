Artist creates chewing gum paintings
Today’s artists continue to surprise audiences with their brilliant artistic ingenuity and creativity, but who would have imagined that gum that had already been chewed before would turn into a brilliant piece of art? 
A Ukrainian artist named Anna Sofia Matveyeva seems to have found her true joy, inspiration and passion in creating artworks made up of chewing gum: She paints her artworks with gum that she and her friends chew. 
This Ukrainian artist is a household name in her hometown of Donetsk by her creations, such as portraits of Elton John and Steve Jobs made entirely with the sweet treat. 
About a thousand chewing gums, chewed by Matveyeva and her friends, were used to produce a portrait of Steve Jobs, Elton John, and a Romanian manager of the local football team FC Shakhtar and therefore, each portrait weighs quite a lot, according to Before It’s News Inc. report on Feb. 14.
The ingredient is ready to be used only after it has been chewed and divided into piles of different shades and colors, the report stated. Then it is warmed up in a microwave before it is made into an artwork. 
“It took three weeks to do Steve Jobs. About a week and a half went on Elton John and Mircea, bit by bit,” Matveyeva said. 
The eccentric artist says that the idea of using chewing gum in her paintings came up several months ago. She adds that chewing gum carries a symbolic meaning: “Chewing gum is not simply a material I use in my work, chewing gum is a symbol. Why chewing gum and why those people? Those people are famous in their profession, the people who have been influenced by many other people in their development, and also the people who themselves greatly influenced other people. One chewing gum is one person. Roughly speaking it’s a symbol.”
Matveyeva plans to open an exhibition as soon as all her pieces get ready.
