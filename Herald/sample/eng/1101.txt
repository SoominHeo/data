Sweden imports trash for energy
For most countries, stacks of garbage are a big headache. But one country in Europe imports such trash from neighboring countries: Sweden.
The northern European nation bought 1 million tons of garbage throughout 2012, all of which was burned to make energy.
In fact, Sweden has recently built a power plant that uses garbage as fuel. The plant burns up 5 million tons of garbage a year to provide 20 percent of all energy consumed in the nation.
Sweden is well-known for its high rate of recycling and garbage incineration. Many incinerators in the country need more garbage to burn for maximal use.
According to Eurostat, a statistics agency of the European Union (EU), Sweden buries 1 percent of all its garbage, which is extremely small compared to other European countries. The average landfill rate in Europe reaches up to 38 percent, according to the agency.
Sweden reportedly says it will increase garbage imports, as the EU plans to reduce its landfill.
Back in 2008, the EU strengthened its grip against uncontrollable waste burial, and countries including the United Kingdom and Italy have been exporting their industrial waste to Sweden.
Sweden plans to further increase its waste utilization, and many European nations are also trying to come up with their own ways to deal with industrial waste, according to news reports.
