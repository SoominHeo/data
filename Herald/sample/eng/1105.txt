Much-loved Tamagotchi returns as smartphone game
In an effort to revive the electronic pet craze of the 1990s, Bandai Co. and Sync Beatz Entertainment have joined forces to launch a new mobile app for Android devices on Feb. 14.
The app is called “Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.,” with “L.i.f.e.” standing for “Love is fun everywhere.” The game is designed to be very similar to the original handheld Tamagotchi device, even duplicating the original egg-shaped handheld device. 
“The idea was to base the gameplay on the original Tamagotchi that everyone knows and loves,” Shin Ueno, chief marketing officer at Sync Beatz, told AP. “As we move along, every two months, we’ll refresh the app, and it will evolve.”
Users have to take care of a virtual pet by feeding, disciplining and playing with it. The game is split into two different modes: the original, egg-shaped three-button version and a full screen app version that uses touch-screen to allow users to play “rock, paper, scissors” with their pets. 
Though several similar applications have been available in app stores, the “Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.” is the first official Tamagotchi app to come from Bandai. 
“It’s like comfort food,” Barry Stagg, chief communications officer at Sync Beatz told AP. “I think Tamagotchi brings back good memories. When we were at the Licensing Expo last year, the first thing that people who came up to us and saw what we were doing tended to do was smile.” 
The “Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.” app is free, though an ad-free, paid version is also available for 99 cents.
