Discover the joys of traveling with Korail’s Sea Train
During the Lunar New Year’s special of KBS’ highly popular entertainment show, “1 Night 2 Days,” viewers were able to get a glimpse of the famed Sea Train. 
As seen on “1 Night 2 Days,” Korail’s Sea Train proved to be a great way to bond while enjoying the beauty of nature in the comfort of a train. 
Unlike other trains, the seats of the Sea Train face the windows, allowing passengers unrestricted views as the train travels along the coast of the East Sea. Along with either family or friends, passengers can enjoy spending quality time together in comfort while watching the blue-green waves of the East Sea crash onto the sandy beach. 
Since it first began operating in July 24, 2007, the three-car Sea Train has provided accommodation and events -- for couples in particular -- geared toward the creation of unforgettable memories. 
Each of the Sea Train’s three cars has been structured to accommodate different types of passengers. The middle car, for example, features specially-designed couple seats for those looking for an air of romance. On the other hand, the third car is specially designed to accommodate large groups traveling together. 
The Sea Train also offers a snack bar within its cars for those looking for something to nibble on or drink as they watch the seaside view pass by like a scene from a movie.
