Core Olympic sports should not change
Pro - On Feb. 12, the IOC decided to change one of the Olympic’s core sports. Wrestling was thrown out of the Games, and taekwondo stayed. I do not think it is right to change the Olympic core sports for the following reasons.
To begin, athletes who had worked hard to compete in the Olympics lost their chance, and their dreams were gone. Wrestling had been an Olympic sport since 708 B.C. I do not think kicking this long-honored sport out was right.
In addition, if we keep changing the Olympic sports, people will be nervous that their favorite sports could be thrown out sometime as well. Because of this, many children will be hesitant to try to become an athlete.
To prevent problems among sports fans and aspiring athletes, I am against the idea of changing the core sports of the Olympics.
Con - Many people around the world enjoy the Olympic Games, but their core sports have constantly changed, which I think is acceptable. The recent decision by the IOC to exclude wrestling is part of this.
Among the sports that have been excluded from the Olympics is a game using guns, which can take people’s lives. There were also games that were too expensive for ordinary people to enjoy, such as polo.
I think there are valid reasons for some sports to be expelled from the Olympic games. Some sports are violent while others are too expensive. Also, having a great variety of sporting events will contribute to the popularity of the Olympic Games. So, I am for the idea of changing the core Olympic sports regularly.
