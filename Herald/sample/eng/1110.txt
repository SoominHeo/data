Eating habits no. 1 reason for obesity among kids
A recent survey revealed that bad dietary habits have led to high obesity rates among Korean students.
The survey by the Education Ministry in February found that 15 percent of Korea‘s elementary, middle and high school students were overweight due to inappropriate eating habits and a lack of exercise.
The survey of 87,000 students from more than 750 schools nationwide said 14.7 percent were categorized as obese, which is slightly higher than previous year.
The ratio of the obese students has been on a constant rise from 11.2 percent in 2008 to 13.2 percent in 2009 and to 14.3 percent in 2010, according to news reports.
The survey showed over half of all students regularly go eat junk food: 56.9 percent of elementary school kids, 63.5 percent of middle school students and 67.7 percent of high school students said they eat fast food at least once a week.
Meanwhile, those who eat vegetables every day accounted for less than 30 percent.
The survey also asked whether students exercise regularly. About half of the elementary school students said they exercise “strenuously” three times a week. However, the rates were lower for middle and high school students with about 30 percent and 20 percent of them, respectively, engaged in the same frequency.
Experts warn that students should get involved in regular exercise and eat healthy diets lest they should come down with adult diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension in future.
