Korea becomes world’s eighth-biggest trader
Korea became the eighth-largest trading country last year, but exports by small and medium-sized companies are on the decline, according to the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. 
The country’s imports and exports totaled $1.07 trillion in 2012 and ranked eighth in the world, the ministry said on March 4, citing a report by the World Trade Organization.
Though the figure was a 1.1 percent fall from the previous year, it surpassed that of Italy for the first time, the report showed.
Also, Korea’s trade ranking has been rising steadily over the years ―- 13th in 2000, 11th in 2007, 10th in 2009, ninth in 2010 and eighth last year.
Despite the growth, Korea should expand the range of its export items, especially those by small and medium-sized corporations, the ministry noted.
The proportion of small and medium-sized companies in the country’s total exports fell from 42.9 percent in 2001, to 34.5 percent in 2010 and to 33 percent in 2011, according to the ministry.
The number of the world’s top exporting businesses in Korea was 61 in 2011, while the corresponding figures in China and Germany were 1,431 and 777, respectively, according to a report by the Korea International Trade Association.
“We strategically need to foster ‘hidden champions,’ meaning small yet powerful companies which may take the initiative in the world market,” said a ministry official.
The United States remained the world’s top trader in 2012 with $3.88 trillion, and China followed closely with $3.86 trillion.
