100 million sharks a year vanish, study finds
A study has found that around 100 million sharks are losing their lives due to thoughtless capture, which may drive the species to extinction.
Researchers at a university in Canada found that from 63 million to 273 million sharks were killed each year between year 2000 and 2010, with an annual average of 100 million captures a year.
They explained that the number is alarming and could lead many shark species to extinction sooner or later.
The sharks are being captured at an average rate that is 30 percent to 60 percent more than they can sustain, say the researchers.
“There’s a staggering number of sharks being caught every year and the number is way too high considering the biology of the species,” Boris Worm, lead researcher of the study reiterated.
According to the researchers, sharks are also caught accidentally by vessels looking for tuna and swordfish.
The captured sharks are mainly used for finning to be served in restaurants.
Countries in Europe, the United States and Australia came up with anti-finning legislation, but the practice is not slowing down in other parts of the world, the study suggests.
