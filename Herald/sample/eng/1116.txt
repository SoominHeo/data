Rediscovering the Land of Oz with ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’
A new twist on a classic tale, Disney’s “Oz the Great and Powerful” tells the story of how the titular character of L. Frank Baum’s classic tale, “Wizard of Oz,” came into being.
Like “Wicked,” “Oz the Great and Powerful” acts as a prequel, providing more insight into the characters of Baum’s “Wizard of Oz.” Much like the classic 1939 film adaptation, “Oz the Great and Powerful” starts off in black and white, showing the life of the man who would later become the Wizard of Oz before a tornado whisks him off to the Land of Oz.
Played by James Franco, Oz - full name Oscar Diggs - is a selfish and narcissistic small town magician who dreams of greatness while working in a traveling circus. When a tornado whisks him off to the Land of Oz, where his arrival is perceived to be a prophecy fulfilled, Oz is presented with a chance to become King of Oz. In order to be King of Oz, however, Oz must choose between his dreams of being great and being a good person. 
In addition to Franco’s brilliant performance as Oz struggling to decide what is right, the portrayal of each of the three witches he meets along the way leaves nothing to be desired. The unique struggles and personalities of Theodora, Evanora and Glinda are all beautifully portrayed by Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams, respectively.
Despite the breathtaking visuals, spectacular performance and both laugh-out-loud and jump-in-your-seat moments, the film is more than just a delight to the eyes or a great source of entertainment. It also manages to teach some valuable lessons. More than the typical good vs. evil conflict, the film also manages to provide further insight into morality through the character of Oz. 
Directed by Sam Raimi, “Oz the Great and Powerful” opened in theaters across the nation on March 7, 2013.
