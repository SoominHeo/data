A bird? A plane? No, just NASA’s space junk
Sometime between Sept. 23 and 24, a retired NASA satellite, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) made its way back to earth 20 years and nine days after it was launched. 
As of Sept. 26, the exact re-entry time and location of fallen debris has not yet been determined.
 The UARS was decommissioned after a successful 14-year mission which “produced some of the first long-term records of chemicals in the atmosphere,” according to the official NASA missions website. 
According to AP, the UARS is the biggest NASA spacecraft to crash back to Earth, uncontrolled, since the 1979 75-ton Skylab space station, and the more than 10-ton Pegasus 2 satellite crashes. Though Russia’s Mir space station came back down to Earth in 2001, it was a controlled dive into the Pacific. 
The UARS was built and launched before new programs to prevent the dangerous, uncontrolled crashes of satellites had been started.
