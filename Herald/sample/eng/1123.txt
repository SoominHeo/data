Weather forecasts help market movers
Recent news reports revealed that almost half of Korea’s enterprises are making use of daily weather updates.
While it is true that tumultuous weather around the world is making people’s life uncertain, timely forecasts are bringing reassurace to businesses.
In fact, weather forecasts have long been an important factor for companies when they prepare monthly or yearly sales estimates. In the past, transportation, power generation and insurance were main industries to benefit from weather forecasts, but now the scope has expanded to include such sectors as foodservice, retail, manufacturing and logistics businesses.
For example, many bakery franchises in Korea are using the so-called “weather index” for their market analysis. With sales data analyzing each outlet’s daily sales volume along with weather information, the headquarters can try to predict the business’ gain and loss much in advance.
Some food companies are launching mobile application services, through which they promote seasonable products with appealing images of foods. Clicking those images will bring customers to the company’s website, which provides customers with more product choices.
Korea Meteorological Administration, the national weather forecast agency, explains that sales of air conditioners and beer soar with the advent of a heat wave. Interestingly enough, sales of pizza increase during the monsoon seasons, and demand for quick delivery services goes up largely when heavy snowfall is around, says the administration. Also, it adds that rain decreases overall sales at department stores.
Now weather information has strengthened its place in forecasting sales numbers in business to the level of foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry explains that more than 50 percent of Korean companies are using weather forecasts to maximize their sales.
