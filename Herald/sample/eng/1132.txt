Kim Yu-na proves she is second to none
Kim Yu-na did it again. She proudly stood atop at the 2013 World Figure Skating Championships in London, Ontario on March 17, overwhelming her rivals with her meticulous performances. 
She captured 148.34 points on Sunday’s free skating program, pushing her total score to 218.31 points in the ladies’ competition. 
Skating to a compilation of music from the popular musical “Les Miserables,” Kim began with a perfect triple lutz-triple toe loop combination, followed by an impeccable triple flip for her second jump. With clean spins and step sequences connecting her jumps, she was able to nail a difficult three-jump combination, with a double axel followed by double toe loop and double loop. In the end, her performance drew an emotional standing ovation at Budweiser Gardens.
Her winning total is the highest score set by a female skater this season and is also Kim‘s second-best score in her career behind her world record 228.56 points during the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Sunday’s strong comeback victory was her second world title, following 2009 win in Los Angeles. She was skating at the world competition for the first time since 2011.
