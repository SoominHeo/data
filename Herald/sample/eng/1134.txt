Sportswear commercials hunt idols for new semester
Sports outfit industries are in competition to get stars in their commercials in time for the new semester.
Rather than focusing on celebrities with longer, exclusive contracts, sportswear companies are looking for new models to boost sales.
For example, FILA Korea renewed its contract with star rhythmic gymnast Son Yeon-jae to feature her daily life at university and road running. The company also employed the boy group Infinite and the swimmer Park Tae-hwan for the new school year marketing.
LECAF singed a contract with boy band MBLAQ and actress Lee Si-young. A company official explained that the two went well with the professional image that LECAF is going after. Lee recently joined Incheon City’s boxing team following serial victories as an amateur boxer.
Prospecs finished filming its promotional video of “Prospecs W” with CN Blue. The company ran a commercial with Kim Yu-na in 2012.
Footwear maker Skechers had concluded an exclusive contract with boy band SHINee and recently posted a video clip of the stars sprinting wearing its shoes.
For companies, so-called “star marketing” has such a great implication for sales. LECAF official explained that MBLAQ’s appearance in a TV entertainment show in late 2012 shot up sales of the company products as the idol stars were wearing them in the show.
However, experts warned that adolescents should stay away from excessive consumption or impulsive buying. “Teenagers tend to model themselves on celebrities, and at the same time they can be isolated from peer groups when they do not join others in buying trendy products,” a ranking official from the Consumers Union of Korea said.
The official added that parents should educate their children that excessive star marketing especially in Korea has much room for improvement as it can be replaced by less expensive, but more efficient marketing.
