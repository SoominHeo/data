Experience world of ’kokdu’ at Kokdu Museum
Director of Kokdu Museum Kim Ok-rang has been collecting kokdu puppets since the 1970s. She first discovered “kokdu” at an antique store near Cheongye Stream. She felt an indescribable connection and comfort to the traditional folk dolls. 
“Kokdu” are traditional wood carvings that were used in funeral rituals. They were thought to chaperone dead people to the afterlife. Their role was to comfort people in grief because they understood people’s sorrows better than anyone else. 
Kokdu Museum is located on the second floor of Dongsoong Art Center in Dongsoong-dong 1-5, Jongno-gu, Seoul. By setting up a museum that specializes in kokdu, Kim wanted people to learn about the value of kokdu dolls and see the beauty of traditional Korean culture. Now the collection amounts to over 20,000 dolls. 
The museum’s motto is to “recreate tradition.” To carry with that vision, it produces various art products such as kokdu exhibits, films, performances, magazine “Kokdugeuk,” and “Kkokdurang,” art products made of kokdu characters that are well accepted by foreigners. The museum also shows an animation about kokdu. 
In the museum’s permanent play, “Kokdu from the late Joseon period,” various forms of kokdu dolls, ranging from dragons, phoenixes, people, tigers and plants such as peony blossoms and lotuses are introduced. Each kokdu is one of a kind and bear unique meanings.
The museum is opened Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. For more information about the museum, visit the museum website, www.kokdumuseum.co.kr or call 02-766-3315.
