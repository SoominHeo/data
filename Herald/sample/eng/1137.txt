Great winning streaks in sports
In sports, a winning streak refers to the consecutive number of games or titles won by a team or an individual.  Miami Heat - the defending NBA champions - is currently on such a streak.  The hottest team in the league, led by the stellar play of reigning MVP LeBron James, has won 21 games in a row. Although what the Heat has accomplished is impressive, the team has a lot more work to do before it can claim a place on the list of the most amazing winning streaks in the history of sports. 
NBA - The longest winning streak in the National Basketball Association (NBA) belongs to the Los Angeles Lakers. In the 1971-1972 season, the Lakers won 33 games in a row from Nov. 5, 1971, to Jan. 9, 1972. The team did not lose a single game for more than three months and went on to compile a record of 69 wins and 13 losses. The team with four future Hall of Fame players went on to win the NBA Championship that season.
NFL (American Football) ? In the National Football League (NFL), the New England Patriots holds the record for the longest winning streak. From 2003 to 2004, the Patriots won 21 consecutive games, including regular season and playoff games. The team, coached by Bill Belichick and featuring a powerful offense led by star quarterback Tom Brady, was as dominant as any team in NFL history. The team won the Super Bowl championship that season -- its third title in four years. 
MLB (Major League Baseball) -- Nearly 100 years ago, the then New York Giants had an unbeaten streak of 26 games during the 1916 season; however, one of the games ended in a rare tie. Major League Baseball excludes all games which end in ties from their official statistics as a policy, so the Giants’ streak stands as the longest. The longest pure winning streak in Major League Baseball was 21 games achieved by the Chicago Cubs in 1935.
NHL (National Hockey League) -- The longest winning streak in the National Hockey League belongs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the 1993 season, the Penguins won 17 consecutive games; the streak came to an end when they played the New Jersey Devils to a 6-6 tie. The powerful team featured four players who reached the 100-point plateau for the season as they finished with the league-best record of 56 wins and 119 points.
Tennis -- One of the most impressive winning streaks in all of sports belongs to tennis legend Martina Navratilova. In 1984, she won 13 tournaments in a row, which amounted to 74 straight matches on various surfaces. She went undefeated from February to December that year, and her 13 titles won included six straight grand slam championships. During her illustrious career, Navratilova also had top-10 ranked winning streaks of 58, 54, and 41 matches.
Boxing ? The longest winning streak in the history of boxing belongs to Mexican boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez. The six-time world champion in three different divisions won the first 87 fights of his career. From his professional debut on Feb. 5, 1980 until his 87th fight on May 5, 1993, Chavez defeated every opponent he faced -- 70 of them by knockouts. During that same span, he was set the record for 27 consecutive successful title defenses.
Athletics -- Edwin Moses won an incredible 122 consecutive races in the 400 meter hurdles over a period that spanned nearly a decade between 1977 and 1987. He won gold medals at the 1976 and 1984 Olympic Games and set the world record in the event on four different occasions. His trademark technique of taking a consistent 13 steps between each of the hurdles and pulling away in the second half of the race proved to be unbeatable during his historic winning streak.
Archery ? The Korean women’s archery team holds the record for winning seven consecutive team titles, from the 1988 Seoul Olympics (the inaugural team competition event) to 2012 London Olympics.
