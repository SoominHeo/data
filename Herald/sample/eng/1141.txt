 Should the death penalty be allowed?
YES – Law enforcement allows for capital punishment when it judges that a criminal should be given an extreme punishment. There are many people who argue against the death penalty, pointing to human rights, but keeping those criminals in society is not only insane but also costly.
More than anything else, those who commit crimes are highly likely to do it again even after they receive rehabilitation education. We can see many such cases in the news in Korea.
Also, keeping those criminals, who will kill people again later on, in jail is like providing them with another chance to do harm to society and costs a lot of money as well. If we let them live, it would be good for nobody.
In conclusion, I would definitely say that we need to have the death penalty to prevent further crimes and keep society as intact as possible. 
NO - Those who voice for the necessity of death penalty contend that the criminals should pay for what they have done. But I do not think this is plausible.
First of all, everyone has the right to live and no one should ever be subjected to this kind of extreme punishment, no matter how guilty they are. Even though some of them have to live in prison, they still have the right to live just like everyone else. Also, the death penalty is morally wrong. Moreover, governments do not have the rights to decide whether or not someone should be killed. 
Furthermore, it’s not that criminals’ sins are erased when they are killed. Let’s say one of your family members was killed in a car accident, and the driver is subject to capital punishment. Even after the driver is executed, nothing will change. The deceased will not come back to life. So, I think it would be better to educate the careless driver and give him a chance to lead his life again.
So for the two aforementioned reasons, I am opposed to the idea of the death penalty. Also, I hope the number of criminals will decrease with appropriate education.
