Costly new school year preparation puts burden on parents
According to a recent poll conducted by Yoon’s English School, about 60 percent of parents of elementary school students spend more than 600,000 won to prepare their kids for the new school year. 
More than 587 elementary school students’ parents took part in the survey which was taken on Yoon’s English School’s community website on March 19. The result of the poll showed the majority of parents face a heavy financial burden in preparing their children for a new school year. 
According to these parents, they spend more than 600,000 won per child on tuition, reference books, textbooks, stationery goods, private education and other things as the new school term begins. 
About 29 percent of the parents who took part in the survey replied they spent an average of 600,000-700,000 won for the new school year preparation, and 23.1 percent responded they spent 700,000 to 800,000 won. Almost five percent spent more than 800,000 won whereas those who spend more than 900,000 won stood at 3.4 percent.
To prepare for the cost of a new school year, 64.1 percent of parents replied they offset the increased spending by cutting back on their spending on other necessities. Some 27 percent stated they prepared in advance, 25.8 percent said they reduced their savings, and 10.1 percent said they did side-jobs or part time work to make ends meet.
In a previous survey conducted by the same company, about 56.6 percent of respondents said they considered themselves as “edu-poor,” meaning they cannot spend much on their children’s education.
