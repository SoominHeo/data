Female stars help products sell out
Some Korean words reflect the trends of the time. Those words are usually made of up three or four characters to create a catchy phrase. Some of those words attached to women in particular are pumjeolnyeo (married women) and doenjangneyo (luxurious women).
A comparatively new word is wanpanneyo, meaning a female celebrity who helps a product sell, either through commercials or just by applying, using or wearing the product in their daily lives.
The word wanpanneyo was brought to attention recently when a lipstick used by figure skater Kim Yu-na suddenly sold out.
Kim’s wearing Dior’s Lip Glow lip balm was caught on a camera on Mar. 18 when she was readying for world championship in Canada. Soon after, shops sold 3,000 of the lipsticks a day, three times higher than usual.
Wanpannyeos include former weather forecaster Ahn Hye-kyung, actress Yoo In-young and actress Yoon Eun-hye.
Meanwhile, a North Korean lady of a similar kind is drawing attention as well - first lady Ri Sol-ju.
News Focus, a North Korean magazine, said on March 19 that the first lady was extremely popular with her eye-catching outfit.
The magazine explained that everything Ri wears continues to be sold out including accessories.
Lee first showed up in front of the public wearing a graceful full black dress in July 2012. Ever since she has worn various colors and patterns, which many North Korean citizens ardently follow.
