Can I catch a cold from my dog?
The simple answer is no. People cannot catch a cold from their pets, but there are some diseases - like strep throat - that can be shared between animals and humans.
More and more people are choosing to adopt pets into their homes. In fact, pets are increasingly being considered family rather than mere animal companions.
Any pet owner will tell you about the many perks of having a household pet. In fact, many scientists will agree, as numerous studies have shown the many benefits having a pet has on a person’s mental and emotional well-being. There are, however, still some dangers associated to pet ownership.
In recent years, doctors and veterinarians have begun to raise awareness of the fact that some diseases can be shared between pets and pet owners. In fact, a recent study published in the Emerging Infections Diseases journal of the United States’ Centers for Disease Control (CDC), scientists urge pet owners to be wary of certain diseases that can be passed between people and animals. 　
Though most people are aware enough to resist touching a random animal in the wild or on the streets, the study suggests pet owners need to be more careful with their own pets. The CDC warns that some people are more likely than others to get diseases from their dogs or cats, depending on their age and health status.

Tips on protecting yourself from pet-related diseases 
　- Vaccinate your pets, particularly against rabies. 
　- Make sure to promptly clean up pet waste. Although many parasites or bacteria are not infectious in fresh pet waste, they may become infectious over time.
　- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and running water after cleaning up your pet’s waste (especially feces).
　- Younger children should always wash their hands after contact with animals, especially after touching animals that aren’t household pets. 
　- Children younger than 5 years old should be supervised while interacting with animals.
　- Children, especially those younger than 5 years old, should not be allowed to kiss pets or to put their hands or other objects into their mouths after handling animals.
　- If you are scratched or bitten by your pet, wash the area with soap and running water right away. Seek medical attention if it looks severe.
Diseases that people can get from animals are called zoonoses (the plural of ‘zoonosis’).
