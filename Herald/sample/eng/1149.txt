 ‘The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer’
Directed by Eduardo Schuldt and produced by Peru-based Dolphin Films, “The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer” is a film about the importance of pursuing one’s dreams despite adversity.
The story is told from the perspective of Daniel Alexander Dolphin, a teenage dolphin who leaves the safety of his pod to embark on a journey to achieve his dreams. 
Daniel spends his days being made fun of by his friends and reprimanded by his elders for being different. Unlike the other dolphins, Daniel has a dream; to one day surf a perfect wave. Seemingly destined to have to give up on his dreams, a visit by a mysterious manta in the dolphins’ lagoon changes everything.
The manta tells Daniel that he has the glow of a dreamer, encouraging him to explore life outside of the safety of his pod and find a way to make his dream come true. 
Unable to resist the call of the open ocean and the infinite possibilities of life beyond the lagoon, Daniel decides to ignore the warnings of his fellow pod members and ventures out into the unknown. 
Along the way, he meets Carl, a street-smart squid who happens to be prone to getting himself into trouble. Carl has also run away from home in search for adventure, because he feels suffocated. Together, the two friends quickly find themselves encountering a variety of characters and challenges in their search for adventure and the meaning of their existence.
Though their journey brings them face to face with dangerous foes, Carl and Daniel also manage to make many friends along the way. 
Based on a novel of the same name written in 1996 by Peruvian author, Sergio Bambarén, “The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer” tells the story of personal rediscovery. It conveys the important message of being true to who you are and the significance of dreams in finding the purpose of one’s existence. 
“The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer” opened in theaters across the nation on March 21.
