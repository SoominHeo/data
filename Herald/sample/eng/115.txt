Denmark’s New PM
On Sept. 15, the leader of the Danish Social Democrats, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, was elected Denmark’s new prime minister. As the first female prime minister-elect, Thorning-Schmidt’s election marks the end of Denmark’s 10-year, right-wing government rule. 
According to AP, a power shift in Denmark’s government “isn’t likely to yield major changes in consensus-oriented Denmark,” where there is a general agreement that high taxes are needed for a strong welfare system. 
Though the Danish economy is currently not as troubled as many other European nations, a lot of unpopular changes still have to be made in order to ease some of the stricter measures imposed by the previous prime minister, Lars Loekke Rasmussen.
