Meteorite rocks far more costly than gold
When a meteorite shower hit the Chelyabinsk region of Russia in mid-February, a good many people in the region were seriously injured. But there were also people who got really lucky in the chaos.
Amateur enthusiasts and scientists scrambled in the shower region to find meteorite fragments that cost 40 times the current cost of gold.
Local scientists told NBC news that the meteorite chunks could be worth up to 66,000 rubles ($2,200) per gram.
“The price is hard to say yet ... The fewer meteorites that are recovered, the higher their price,” said Dmitry Kachkalin, a member of the Russian Society of Amateur Meteorite Lovers to the news.
The high price of meteorites comes from the “scarcity value” the rare rocks have.
Russian scientists explained that 53 small, stony, black objects were found around Lake Chebarkul where the meteorites fell.
The fragments were 0.5 to 1 cm (0.2 to 0.4 inches), and all of those are hard to be detected from the Earth soil, according to news reports.
“The fragments we have found are traces of the outer layer of the meteorite -– there is a melted crust and so forth -– which means that the basic mass lies there, in the lake,” Viktor Grokhovsky, a member of the Russian Academy of Science’s committee on meteorites, explained to Fox News, a U.S. cable TV news channel.
According to meteorite experts, the scarce rocks’ values are determined by factors such as rarity of type, condition, size and aesthetic appeal. They also explain that if a rock from space has been properly classified and named by a recognized academic institution, it has a higher monetary value than an unclassified specimen.
