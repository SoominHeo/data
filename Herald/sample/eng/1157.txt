Do you play a musical instrument?
Musical instruments and brain development 
Many Korean students can relate to the frustrations of being forced to learn a musical instrument. In fact, even the most avid of music fans tend to find practicing tedious. 
Unfortunately for those looking for an excuse to quit their music lessons, recent studies have shown that musical training at a young age can have a positive effect on brain development. 
Despite how boring it may be to practice the violin or piano, a recent study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that musicians who began their training before age 7 had more white matter in the part of the brain called the corpus callosum. This means that their brains developed more powerful connections between the parts of the brain that help plan and execute movement in the body.
“Work from our laboratory has shown that early-trained musicians (training begun before age 7) outperform late-trained musicians (training begun after age 7) on auditory and visual sensorimotor synchronization tasks -– even when matched (year) for year of training and experience,” wrote the study researchers.
In fact, based on the results of the study, researchers found significant evidence that the years between ages 6 and 8 are crucial in the development of motor skills and brain structure. Starting musical training around this time, combined with normal brain development, resulted in the creation of deep-rooted changes in motor abilities and brain structure. 
Unfortunately, beginning to play a musical instrument at a young age does not seem to have any bearing on developing prodigy-like musical skills.
“Musical performance is about skill, but it is also about communication, enthusiasm, style and many other things that we don‘t measure,” lead researcher Virginia Penhune, a psychology professor at Concordia University, said in a statement. ”So, while starting early may help you express your genius, it probably won’t make you a genius.”
