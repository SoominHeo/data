Latest sports star-actress romance heats up local media
After the soccer match with Qatar for the 2014 FIFA Brazil World Cup qualification on March 26, photos of soccer player Ki Sung-yueng going on a late-night date with actress Han Hye-jin went viral on the net. Shortly after, Ki confirmed his relationship with Han through his Twitter account. 
The 24-year-old player said he has been seeing Han, 32, for months. “We have profound feelings for each other which give us great energy,” Ki said.
In fact, the rumor of him and Han dating came several months ago when Ki appeared on a talk show, “Healing Camp” where Han appears as the show’s host. In the show, he remarked that he would instantly get married if it was to Han. The statement was not just a simple revelation of his ideal type -- it turned out to bear a lot more meaning than that. 
The rumor grew larger when Ki was pictured wearing soccer shoes encrypted with the phrase “HJ SY 24” while training for a soccer match with Qatar. A slew of local media suspected that the initials stood for Hye-jin, Sung-yueng and his Premier League club Swansea City number 24. When asked whether he was dating Han, Ki responded mysteriously, “Not until the game ends…”
Han also confirmed the relationship through her social networking account. She said that she takes the relationship seriously but unlike far-fetched speculation, she has not seen his family to set the wedding date. Ki has earned popularity among young Koreans for his handsome looks and stellar performance on the field.
Other sports player-actress couples include soccer player An Jung-hwan and actress and former Miss Korea Lee Hye-won who tied the knot 13 years ago. Soccer player Lee Dong-guk married former Miss Korea Lee Soo-jin in 2005; they have twin girls together. In 2009, Korean national soccer player Jung Jo-guk married actress Kim Sung-eun and Lee Ho married former girl group member Yang Eun-ji.
