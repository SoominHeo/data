 ‘Humanity-focused’ school to open next month
A school that focuses on “humanity education” is set to open in South Jeolla’s Jangseong County in May.
As the first of its kind, the school is specially designed to educate its students on humanity and character building. According to news reports, the foundation of the school - named the “Humart Humanity School” – is part of four campaign projects designed to promote humanity education.
Sponsored by 11 different government and private institutions including the Ministry of Education and the JoongAng Ilbo, the main goal of the school’s programs is to teach its students the social skills that are the building blocks of humanity. In fact, the name “Humart” is actually a portmanteau of the words “humanity” and “smart.” 
“Everyone agrees how important it is to have an education on humanity but has so far stopped short of providing the right educational course for it,” Representative Choung Byoung-gug of the Saenuri Party said during the agreement signing ceremony on March 22.
“Emboldened by participation by various social organizations, we will strive to build an education that is sustainable and responsible for young students.” Choung, who jointly heads the National Assembly’s humanity education forum, added. 
The founding of the Humart Humanity School marks the first time that public, private, civic and media groups have come together to contribute to an educational campaign. 
Starting in May, students from four dozen elementary and middle schools will be invited to participate in a three-day program every week. State-run rail operator KORAIL, one of the school’s co-sponsors, will provide students with a ride to the school, whereas Hyundai Motors has agreed to donate a bus to the program.
