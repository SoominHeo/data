Why people hate the sound of their recorded voice
You might have an experience of listening to your voice recording and being stunned and embarrassed by how awkward it sounds. Well you are not alone; lots of people respond negatively towards the sound of their recorded voice.
According to CNBC news, sound enters people’s ears in two ways: air-conducted or bone-conducted.
When people listen to their voice recordings, the sound enters ears in an air-conducted way. In this case, the sound is transmitted through the eardrums, vibrating three bony ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) and ends up in the cochlea. The cochlea, a fluid-filled spiral structure, then converts the vibrations into nerve impulses so the brain can perceive them.
But when speaking, sounds are heard in both air- and bone-conducted ways. With bone-conducted sounds, vibrations from our vocal cords directly reach the cochlea, allowing the brain to lower the frequency of those vibrations. 
“When people listen to a recording of their voice speaking, the bone-conducted pathway is eliminated and they hear only the air-conducted component,” Dr. Chris Chang, an otolaryngologist at Fauquier Ear, Nose & Throat Consultants in Warrenton, Virginia says. This is why people find their recorded voice higher-pitched than they believed.
But why do people dislike what they hear so much? It is a matter of psychology, says Pascal Belin, a professor of psychology at University of Glasgow. “It’s kind of the same way we like what we see in the mirror, but not what we see in photographs.” The shortcomings people see in the picture do not match up with what the brains expect to see.
Likewise, people are not used to hearing air-conducted voices. “We never actually hear our voice like other people hear it, hence our surprise when hearing a recording,” says Belin. “We find it hard to believe it is actually our voice.”
