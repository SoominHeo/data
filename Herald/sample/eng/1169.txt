High-tech meets tradition in ’Dungdu-koong Robot Fair’
Today, robots are no longer a thing of science fiction films. From cleaning robots to medical robots, they are ubiquitous and a significant part of people’s lives. As robots become more familiar with people’s daily lives, their influence on society has grown. 
“Dungdu-koong Robot Fair” by the Korean Traditional Performing Arts Foundation made good use of this new growth engine industry by combining traditional culture of Korea with robot technology. In this traditional performance for children, robots teach Korean culture. 
A total of 16 Dungdu-koong Robot Fair shows were put on in six elementary schools in North Geongsang Province, including Chilgok, Andong, Uljin, and Ulleungdo Island from March 8-21.
Mini humanoid robots wearing traditional red robes demonstrate traditional Korean dance according to the music played by traditional instruments such as carillon and Pyeongyeong, jade stone chimes. The show begins with a royal ancestral rites performance. It is followed by a Korean fan dance and a lion mask dance, which is part of the traditional Korean Bongsan mask dance. The show ends with the taekwondo dance performance.
As part of a pilot robot technology distribution program, the show will continue to visit children across the nation to boost their interest and curiosity in their own culture and teach Korean history.
