Goodbye, MSN Messenger!
The 14-year service of Microsoft’s instant messaging service was discontinued on April 8.
The U.S.-based software giant announced early in the year that it would be cutting MSN Messenger service as of April, merging the service with Skype.
Skype, which was first released in 2003, allows users to communicate with peers by voice using a microphone, video by using a webcam, and instant messaging over the Internet.
Those still using Messenger see a message at the bottom of the program window that reads, “Move between instant messaging, voice and video. Upgrade to Skype.”
“The company’s move to converge the two platforms started to apply in Korea beginning April 8 and the users will receive a message to upgrade their messengers as a measure,” Microsoft Korea spokesperson Lee Seung-yeon told The Korea Herald.
Lee also told the paper that the messenger would be automatically upgraded if the users chose not to upgrade it themselves.
Microsoft has been promoting Skype since its acquisition of Skype Technologies in October 2011. 
Industry experts say the rise of mobile messengers ― like Kakao Talk, Line and WhatsApp ― have contributed to Microsoft’s decision to end the service.
Kakao Talk has hit the jackpot in Korea while NHN’s Line messenger has swept neighboring Japan.
Kakao, for its part, has lately been moving beyond mobile and bringing its service to computers.
“Even we could see that many threats are being posed against the instant messengers. And these won’t be the only threats that are challenging the good old messengers,” said an industry watcher.
Facebook is also a huge challenge for firms like Microsoft due to its large active user base. Its message system is widely used as a communication tool by the many users visiting the site frequently throughout the day.
