New ‘Infinite Challenge’ tour package available
The Hawaii Tourism Authority has recently released a special travel package modeled after the activities featured in recent episodes of the popular MBC entertainment show, “Infinite Challenge.”
Last March, members of “Infinite Challenge” touched down in Hawaii to film the “Waikiki Brothers” special. Aired in three separate segments between March 23 and April 6, the special episodes showed members Yoo Jae-suk, Park Myung-soo, Jung Joon-ha, Jung Hyung-don, Gil (Gil Sung-joon), Haha (Ha Dong-hun) and Noh Hong-chul excitedly wandering around Hawaii, showcasing the unique range of active, outdoor activities available in the “Aloha State.”
As a result of the massive exposure provided by the “Infinite Challenge” special episodes, the Hawaii Tourism Authority has decided to introduce the new “Infinite Challenge Hawaii Tour Package” to stimulate tourism during the off-season.
The package itself will include many of the activities the seven members experienced during filming. In fact, the travel package includes direct, round-trip Asiana Airlines flights between Incheon and Honolulu, free room upgrades at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the chance to check out some of the water and land activities as portrayed during the “dice of luck” mission at Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon for free and more. 
According to the April issue of the “Hawaii Tourism Asia” monthly newsletter, six select travel agencies, working together with Asian Airlines and Hawaii Tourism Korea, will be advertising the special tour package. Available for purchase until June 14, prices start at 1.5 million won per person and the travel period runs until Nov. 15, excluding the peak season between July and August.
