 Cowboy Day celebrated in U.S. state of Arizona
The U.S. state of Arizona has created an annual “National Day of the Cowboy,” according to a Reuters report on April 13.　
Jan Brewer, the governor of the state, recently signed legislation to create a special day for both cowboys and cowgirls.
She said setting this special day was in tandem with the state’s effort to honor its “unique cowboy culture.” It would help recognize its proper place in history, Brewer, a Republican, further noted in a statement. 
“Many of the blessings enjoyed by Arizonans today are because of the contributions of our keepers of the range: The Arizona cowboys and cowgirls.” 
“These men and women -- of all races and backgrounds -- are among the truest symbols of the American southwest.“
The cowboys will be honored every fourth Saturday in July in the state of Arizona. Unfortunately, it will not be a paid legal holiday, according to the report. 
Arizona, which celebrated its 100th anniversary last year, is not alone in the effort to honor cowboys in U.S. history. With the announcement by the governor, it becomes the fourth state in the nation to observe such a day, following three other states -- New Mexico, Wyoming and California -- which are already observing similar days.
