(Special) Fight between good and evil captured in new fantasy film, “Beautiful Creatures”
With Children’s Day just around the corner (along with the 9th anniversary of the Junior Herald) how about spending a warm bright spring day by watching a new fantasy film? Here is the perfect choice for you: the newly released film, “Beautiful Creatures.” 
Storyline of the movie
Sixteen-year-old Ethan Wate has lost his mom in a car accident and lives in the small town of Gatlin, South Carolina with his dad and long-time housekeeper Amma. One day, a mysterious new girl named Lena Duchannes moves to the town. 
Ethan and Lena get closer and Lena comes forward and tells Ethan that she is a Caster who can take control of the weather and create electric shocks. When she turns 16, she has to choose between the Light and Dark sides of the magic world. Acknowledging that she will become the most powerful Caster, controlling both Light and Dark, all eyes are on her. If Lena goes Dark, all her Light Caster relatives will die. If Lena goes Light, all her Dark relatives — including her mom, Sarafine and her cousin Ridley, who went Dark a year ago will die. Though Macon, her uncle, is a Dark creature, he supports Lena in going Light, fighting against the influence of her vicious mother, Seraphine. 
Probably the most impressive scene of the film is when the table revolves like a roller coaster during the power struggle between Lena and her evil cousin Ridley.
