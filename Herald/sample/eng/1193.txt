Happy British children
It would be so great if children around the world could enjoy every moment they spend during the day, either by focusing on what they like to do or just living their life without much trouble.
Happiness is of course a subjective term that can be defined by different elements and in numerous ways, but children in the United Kingdom seem “happy” to the level that their Korean friends will be jealous.
An official report of the U.K.’s National Statistics Office said in early April that 9 out of 10 children in the country were “happy with most areas of their lives.”
The result was based on a survey of 10-14 year olds that has been conducted since 2009. In the survey, the kids were asked how they felt about life, friends, family, school, school work and appearance. The kids were asked to answer on a seven-point scale from “completely happy” to “not at all happy.”
Eighty-nine percent said they were happy with their life as a whole while only 4 percent described themselves as the opposite.
For the question “With whom they were most happy,” over 50 percent said they felt “completely happy” when they were with friends.
Although students’ life involving the outside world was less favored than their friendship in the index, the kids were shown to enjoy their school life in general as well. Around two-thirds were either “completely happy” or “somewhat happy” with their school life. More interestingly, a whopping 82 percent said they were even happy with their schoolwork.
By gender, boys were happier than girls; 91 percent and 88 percent of each group said they were happy with their life in general.
