 Adam Scott becomes 1st Australian to win the Masters
Adam Scott, a 32-year athlete, became the first Aussie to win a Masters Cup, one of world’s major golf tournaments, on April 14.
He beat Argentina’s Angel Cabrera at the second playoff hole of the 77th Masters, recording a total of 9-under 279 for four rounds.
It was also his first major title, and he took home $1.44 million in prize money.
The Masters has been the only one of four majors that did not allow a triumph for Australian players. So far, Australian golfers have won the British Open nine times, PGA Championships four times, and the U.S. Open twice.
Australians almost grabbed the Masters title in 2011 when Scott settled for second, but the trophy went to Charl Schwartzel of South Africa.
Other than the Masters, Scott won eight U.S. PGA tours, and among the biggest wins of his career before the 2013 Masters are the 2004 Players Championship and the 2011 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. 
News reports say that Scott’s victory in the 2013 Masters is considered a redemption for his failure to win the previous year’s Open Championship. His winning moved Scott to No. 3 in the world golf ranking.
Scott was born in Adelaide, South Australia and moved with his family at the age of nine to the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.
He completed his high school education at The Kooralbyn International School, where he took extra subjects in golf. He was a member of the Golf Australia National Squad. He later attended the University of Nevada in Las Vegas.
