 Enjoy a mountain trip with KORAIL
The state-run rail operator launched a special sightseeing service that explores the beauty of Korean mountain ranges in early April.
The so-called “V-train” passes through the valleys of the “Baekdu-daegan,” mountain range that runs through the eastern part of the Korean Peninsula.
Baekdu-daegan is not only called the “spine of the Korean Peninsula” but is also a symbol of the peninsula’s history, culture and scenery, The Korea Herald explained in a recent article.
The V-train starts from Cheoram, Gangwon Province and reaches Buncheon, North Gyeongsang Province.
As to the purpose of the V-train service, a KORAIL official explained to The Korea Herald: “Because of the geographic location and the traffic inconvenience, however, its charms were largely veiled to the public.”
Riding on the special train, visitors can enjoy the hidden mountain landscapes and the peaceful countryside, as well as the tourist services provided by the national rail service provider.
In order to access the V-train, visitors are recommended to first take Korail’s “O-train,” which connects Seoul and Jecheon, and then loops around Jecheon, Yeongju and Taebaek.
Trains depart from Seoul Station at 7:45 a.m. every morning, arriving at the transferring station in Jecheon at 9:55 a.m.
From there, passengers may flag specific stations and routes to reach the valley area and the V-train.
In order to provide a thorough view of the steep ranges and valleys, the V-train operates at an average speed of 30 kilometers per hour in most sections and stops every now and then at photogenic spots.
The close view of the untouched valleys and the tranquil landscape of the rural stops offer an unparalleled experience, not only to senior citizens but also to foreign visitors to Korea, according to the KORAIL official.
