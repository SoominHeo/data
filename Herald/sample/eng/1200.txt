Kid’s recipe contest to be hosted by White House
Here is some good news for kids who love to cook. First lady Michelle Obama is hosting the second Healthy Lunchtime Challenge, where U.S. kids aged 8 to 12 can submit their original lunch recipes for nutritious meals for an opportunity to attend a State Dinner at the White House.
Obama said the recipe contest is part of her “Let’s Move” campaign which has been encouraging children to make exercise a part of their daily routine. “Last year’s young chefs impressed and inspired me with their creativity, and I can’t wait to welcome a whole new group to the White House this summer and taste their creations,” Obama said in an announcement. “So kids, let’s get cooking!”
Winners from each of the 50 U.S. states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, will be invited to attend the Kids’ State Dinner at the White House where their own recipes will be served.
Last year’s winning dishes were a fiesta casserole from Idaho, a rainbow salad from Colorado and a yummy summer soup from Alabama. 
Tanya Steel, the editor-in-chief of recipe website Epicurious and one of the judges of the contest, said the winning recipes will be “imaginative and creative,” and she advised to “think seasonally.” 
“You don’t need to be complicated. The most important thing is to have fun.”
Judges will be looking for menus that are healthy, tasty and affordable; but most importantly, it should include nutrients from each food group, including fruit, vegetables, whole grains, proteins and low-fat dairy products. 
To enter the contest, kids should submit their recipes at recipechallenge.epicurious.com by May 12.
