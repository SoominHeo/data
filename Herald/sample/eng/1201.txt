 Legendary singer Cho Yong-pil revives flailing CD market
Sixty-three-year-old singing legend Cho Yong-pil released his 19th album entitled “Hello” on April 23, quickly beating out Psy’s “Gentlemen” for the No. 1 spot on various local music charts.
In a surprising twist, Cho’s latest album release has revived, if somewhat briefly, the dying CD industry. In fact, hundreds of people were lined up outside the Youngpoong Bookstore in central Seoul, hours before the record went on sale at 9 a.m. In an almost unheard-of feat since downloading became the norm, 20,000 copies of Cho’s album were sold on the day of its release.
The phenomenal success of Cho Yong-pil’s “Hello,” released an astounding 45 years after the singer’s debut, proves once and for all that he is indeed a legend in the Korean music scene.
