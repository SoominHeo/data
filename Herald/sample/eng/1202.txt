Controversy over actress Lee Si-young’s ‘national athlete’ title
Actress Lee Si-young is now faced with controversy as allegations of bias have surfaced over her recently earned "national athlete" title.
Lee’s match with 19-year-old boxing athlete Kim Da-som ended with a 22-20 decision win for Lee, a result that is now being contested by Kim’s trainer, Choi Rak-hwan.
“She lost her chance to make the national team because of biased judging,” Choi told Yonhap News. 
Others disagree, however, suggesting that gripes about Kim’s loss come from not fully grasping the difference between amateur and professional boxing. 
“In amateur boxing, technique is more important than power when counting blows,” explained the boxing federation’s deputy secretary-general Choi Hee-gook.
