UAE imposes fines on revealing swimwear
People sunbathing in skimpy bikinis are no longer welcomed on a beach near Dubai, United Arab Emirates, AP reported on April 22.
Authorities in Ras al-Khaimah, the northernmost emirate in the UAE, have posted warning signs on public beaches which read that those wearing revealing swimwear such as two-piece bikinis for women and brief trunks for men will be fined. 
The move was allegedly brought by localsâ€™ complaints that they were offended by tourists showing too much skin on the beach. The emirate is located about 100 kilometers northeast of Dubai.
