One-way trip to Mars recruits volunteers
We are not talking about a trip to Mars via NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity; we are talking about a one-way trip to Mars with a Dutch nonprofit organization called the Mars One Foundation.
According to a CNN report on April 23, the European organization is recruiting applicants for its “one-way trip to Mars” project.
The foundation said in New York that it is planning to send the first group of humans to Mars in 2022 and establish the first permanent human settlement on the red planet after landing there the following year. 
Bas Lansdorp, chief executive officer of Mars One, said during the announcement that there are no new inventions needed to land humans on Mars. The biggest challenge of the mission is financial. Yet, he already seemed to find a solution -- he suggested making the trip one-way to save money. 
The idea is to let volunteers live out the rest of their lives on Mars, Lansdorp says. “It‘s likely that there will be a crematorium…It’s up to the people on Mars to decide what to do with their dead.”
Anyone over 18 years old can apply for the Mars One effort by submitting a video and a $38 application fee.
”We are very excited about launching the selection program. Round One is where we open the doors to Mars for everyone on Earth. This is an international mission and it is very important for the project that anyone anywhere can ask themselves: Do I want this? Am I ready for this? If the answer is yes then we want to hear from you,” Lansdorp said.
Meanwhile, Grant Anderson of the Paragon Space Development Corp., a partner in the mission expressed some doubts, saying, “Questions of reliability and robustness have to be answered before we leave Earth.”
