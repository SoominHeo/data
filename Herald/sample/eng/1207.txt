More safety, more fun
Even though an amusement park provides a great amount of fun and pleasure, it would mean nothing if any of its visitors gets hurt or injured due to operational glitches made in the place.
To prevent such misfortune and strengthen the “safety first” policy at amusement parks nationwide, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) introduced a plan to make the visitors to such parks give marks to their “satisfaction level.”
As of April 23, 16 amusement parks including Seoul Land, Everland Resort and Lotte World are being graded on their service through an online marking system.
On the website “Smart Consumer” run jointly by the FTC and the Korea Consumer Agency, people are advised to give their marks on the amusement parks’ facilities, operation, convenience and satisfaction.
The FTC explained through the press release that the new measure is aimed to reduce safety accidents in amusement parks when a larger number of visitors are expected in the spring season.
A recent survey found that “amusement park” stays atop the consumers’ list of favorite tourism products in the area of “leisure and culture.”
Through the online evaluation, customers - both children and adults - will have their chance to express their opinions about the amusement park‘s facilities in general, hospitality of the employees, access to the park, product pricing, etc.
To encourage people’s participation in the open survey, the FTC is running an online event on the “Smart Consumer” website (www.smartconsumer.go.kr), and a lucky handful will get a notebook computer or a 20,000 won gift certificate. The event runs until late August.
