Children’s musical ‘Cats’ shows true meaning of friendship
One brilliant way to spend your spring day is to go see a well-made musical with fun, dreams and imagination. 
The children’s musical “Cats” fits those criteria. This kid-tailored musical is filled with a funny yet touching storyline, extravagant dance moves, fancy costumes and passionate live music performances.
Every cat in the play has their shortcomings. A white cat named Rari wants to change her looks, chubby cat Dangley wants to slim down a bit. Coward Gubi wishes he could be braver. Archi, the wanderer of the crew, always picks on his fellow cats but deep down, he dearly wants to get closer to them. 
All in all, they resemble humans in many ways. These cats in the end find their true selves with the help of one another -- and discover friendship. 
The play has been staged for over a decade in more than 21 cities nationwide. And the result speaks for itself. The show offers an unforgettable experience for both kids and parents; thus it is a perfect getaway plan for anyone this season. 
Summary of “Cats”
Despite destitute living conditions and low pay, members of the cats’ circus team live happily day by day, relying on one another. Every time, these talented cats bring in large audiences and the team manager makes a lot of money. But the pitiless circus manager only gives out a small piece of fish to them. One day, the team’s ace gets injured and ruins the whole play. The furious manager kicks him out and replaces him with a new cat. The new cat bullies the other cats, who are all sad to have lost their old friend. In the end, they all reunite.
The show runs until Sept. 1 at Sorihall at Daehangno, Hyehwa-dong. For more information, call (02) 766- 2022.
