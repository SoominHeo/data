Comedian Jung Bum-kyun saves man from suicide attempt
Comedian Jung Bum-kyun has come into the spotlight recently over his brave actions on the night of April 28, when he saved a man who was attempting to jump to his death from the Mapo Bridge.
Best known for being a doppelganger of popular MC Yoo Jae-suk, Jung played a crucial role in saving a drunken man in his 40s from plunging to his death by grabbing and holding onto him until rescue services arrived at the scene.
“When the man attempting suicide told him to let him go, Mr. Jung Bum-kyun tried to coax the man, saying, ‘What is troubling you so much. Don’t do this’,” the first person to alert emergency services said of the situation in a news report that revealed the CCTV footage of the incident. 
“Upon arrival at the site after receiving the call, we found Jung Bum-kyun holding the man attempting suicide from behind, waiting for rescue services to arrive,” a representative for the Mapo Fire Station told Chosun Daily.
Once rescue services had the situation under control, Jung is said to have quietly slipped away. 
According to representatives of the comedian’s company, Jung felt he was merely doing what had to be done, saying “Jung Bum-kyun himself admitted it was terrifyingly dizzy. Anyone in the same situation would have done the same thing.” 
Jung’s good Samaritan act and his subsequent modesty about it prompted netizens to sing praises about the comedian on various message boards, blog posts and comments, including “Jung Bum-kyun seems to have a good head on his shoulders” and “From now on, I am a Jung Bum-kyun fan.”
