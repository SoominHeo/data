Netherlands welcomes first new king in over a century
People in the Netherlands have welcomed the country’s first new king in 123 years at a coronation ceremony held in Amsterdam’s Nieuwe Kerk church on April 30, according to USA Today.
Holland’s previous monarch was Queen Beatrix, 75, mother of the newly appointed king, Willem-Alexander. She had ruled the country for 33 years. 
After more than three decades on the throne, Queen Beatrix, stepped down and abdicated her throne to her eldest son, Willem-Alexander, 46. He was crowned the new Dutch king, the first king since Willem III in 1890.
During the ceremony, Beatrix signed a statement that read: “I now withdraw from my office of Queen of the Netherlands, and the monarchy will now be transferred to my eldest son, Willem-Alexander.” She said earlier this year that it was time for “a new generation” to reign.
The new king has a popular wife, who now became Queen Maxima of Holland. She worked as an investment banker in Argentina. She wore a royal blue ensemble at the inauguration ceremony where a long list of royal guests attended to pay respect to the new monarch. The king has three daughters. His eldest, Catharina-Amalia, became Princess of Orange and is now first in line in the throne of the House of Orange-Nassau. 
Thousands of people gathered in Amsterdam’s Dam Square wearing orange outfits, the country’s signature color, and waved flags in celebration. 
”I am happy and grateful to introduce to you your new king, Willem-Alexander,“ Beatrix told a cheering crowd from the balcony of the Royal Palace.
“I want to establish ties, make connections and exemplify what unites us, the Dutch people,” the new king followed.
The generational change gave the nation a brief moment of festivity as this European nation of 17 million struggles to fight economic troubles.
