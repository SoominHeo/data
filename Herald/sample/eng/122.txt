Back to school for the Duchess of Cambridge
According to news reports, the Britain‘s Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Catherine, has been set to undergo a series of private, one-on-one lessons on life as a member of the Royal family. 
Since her return from her tour of Canada and the U.S. with her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, Royal aides have limited the Duchess’ official duties to one engagement a month. This was done to allow the Duchess to adjust to her new life, as well as the responsibilities that come with it. 
According to The Telegraph, a daily British newspaper, this “highly structured approach to preparing the Duchess for life as a senior member of the Royal family is in marked contrast to the experience of the Duke’s late mother, Diana Princess of Wales.” 
Princess Diana had been known to have been critical about the lack of both formal and informal training to help her adjust to her Royal status. 
The article also reports that the Duke of Cambridge had made clear from the beginning that “then Kate Middleton would be given all possible support in being introduced to the unique demands placed on members of the Royal family.” 
Having witnessed what his late mother had gone through, he was determined not to let his new bride face the same humiliation and difficulties. The Duke has been insistent on welcoming the Duchess’ family into their lives, rather than “being ‘airbrushed’ from public life as has often happened in the past.” 
In the meantime, it is understood that the Duchess has been spending her time equally between the couple’s home on the island of Anglesey and London, where she is simultaneously undertaking private lessons with experts on government, the arts and the media, and meeting with charity representatives to decide which of them she would like to officially support.
