Celebrate the value of family with Dreamworks’ ‘The Croods’
May is “Family Month” in Korea, and what better way to celebrate family than to watch DreamWorks Animation’s hilarious yet heartwarming animated film about love and family in “The Croods.”
The film tells the story of a family of six cavemen struggling to survive in prehistoric times. There are six members of the Crood family: Grug, the well-meaning but overprotective father; Ugga, Grug’s loving wife; Eep, Grug and Ugga’s rebellious eldest daughter who is filled with curiosity and desire for adventure; Thunk, Eep’s dense younger brother, who has terrible coordination but a good heart; Sandy, Grug and Ugga’s baby daughter who still bites and growls instead of speaking; and Gran, Grug’s very old yet feisty mother-in-law.
The Croods have outlived other prehistoric families by adhering to Grugg’s strict rules for survival. The repetitiveness and austerity of Grugg’s rules does not sit well with Eep, who finds their life rather tedious and boring.
One night, despite her father’s rule about staying inside the cave at nighttime, Eep ventures out in search of the source of a mysterious light. It is during this outing that she meets Guy, a nomadic caveboy whose way of life intrigues Eep. Unlike the Croods, Guy likes to use his brain to come up with ideas and inventions to survive the dangers of prehistoric life. 　
Having never ventured out far from their little cave, the Croods are forced into an adventure when an earthquake destroys their little home. With nowhere else to turn, a reluctant Grugg and excited Eep are forced to seek the help of Guy to help them find their way to safety. 
While Guy eventually becomes Eep’s love interest, he also makes an impact on each of the members of the Crood family, teaching them the difference between living and merely surviving. 　
“The Croods” premieres in theaters on May 16.
