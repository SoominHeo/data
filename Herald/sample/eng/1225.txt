Will Smith, Jaden Smith: Father and son visit Korea
Hollywood star Will Smith found himself in the midst of media frenzy during his visit to Korea to promote his latest film, “After Earth.” 
Accompanied by his son, Jaden Smith, the father-son duo flew to Korea to promote and attend the premiere of their new film. This is the second time that father and son have teamed up for a film. The two first worked together in the 2006 film, “The Pursuit of Happiness.” 
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, “After Earth” is set in the near future, telling the story of a father and son, played by Will and Jaden, struggling to survive after crash-landing on Earth 1,000 years after humans have deserted the planet.
The premiere of “After Earth,” held at Time Square in Yeongdeungpo, Seoul on May 7, drew particular attention when it was revealed which Korean stars would be in attendance. Two of Korea’s most popular child actors Yeo Jin-goo and Kim Yoo-jung were given the chance to meet with fellow rising young actor Jaden Smith, while Jay Park is said to have attended after the father-son duo personally requested that he sing a song on the film’s Korean soundtrack album. 
Additionally, Will Smith made headlines when he suggested the possibility of collaborating with global K-pop sensation Psy, depending on the success of “After Earth.”
“If this movie is successful in Korea, I’m gonna do a song with Psy,” Smith said during a news conference to promote the film. “If it’s a huge success in Korea, I might do a record with Psy.”
“After Earth” will hit local theaters on May 30.
