Food safety crisis reignited in China
China is notorious for deep-rooted safety problems. In 2008, melamine-contaminated baby milk powder made 300,000 Chinese infants sick and killed at least 6. The incident led to the arrests of throngs of food producers and companies and some were even executed. 
Yet, food-safety scandals continue to linger in China, from pork contaminated with the drug clenbuterol, which can cause heart palpitations, to man-made fake eggs, which are concoctions of gelatin, paraffin and other chemicals.
In recent weeks, China’s news media Xinhua reported sales of mislabeled meat that was actually mink or rat meat. Following three months of chasing and investigation, police in China successfully seized tons of bogus meat dealers. Some 904 suspects were rounded up for selling fake mutton made of fox, mink and rat. Meat injected with water and diseased meat was also seized. Other offenders added chemicals illegally to make their products more cost-effective. Two “meat processing and selling dens” in southwest China used hydrogen peroxide, a kind of bleach, to process chicken feet, according to the Xinhua news report. 
Those shady profiteers are willing to go as far as they can, thinking the potential profits from unsafe practices exceed the odds of getting caught, the New York Times noted in 2011.
The situation hurts not only consumers but producers, as skeptical customers keep to imported products, avoiding locally produced ones out of fear of contamination. In fact, imported dairy products almost quintupled in 2009, the year after the melamine scandal.
Beijing’s Ministry of Public Security has declared food safety a national priority and the latest raids were its first part of the food safety enforcement campaign efforts, Xinhua News said.
