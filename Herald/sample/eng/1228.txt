YouTube starts paid subscription service
We have long known YouTube as a free Internet content provider. But companies are not out there to do good to people without any returns. They seek profits from their service.
As such, the video service offered by Internet search engine Google has recently launched a paid subscription service, making people consider whether they would pay for it.
The Korea Herald reported recently that YouTube was close to launching paid channels as early as the second week of May.
The newspaper quoted YouTube as saying that the company was looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more content to YouTube.
News reports said that if the new subscription system went into effect, there would be around 50 paid channels offering different topics such as films, TV shows or music for a subscription fee as low as $1.99 a month.
Since 2008, YouTube has generated revenues by placing ads and providing video rental services, according to The Korea Herald. With the new paid subscription system, the company is expected to focus on producing more original content for viewers, it added.
