Power of sound can change the world
Commemorating its 300th show, kid’s musical, “Kisable Musical (Beatlekkaebi)” is running encore performances at the Gwacheon National Science Museum in May.
“I wanted to send a positive message of changing the world with beautiful sounds,“ said Jung Yoon-chul, professional animator and art director of “Beatlekkaebi.” 
Actors in the show create sounds by shaking plastic instruments filled with red beans and introduce a variety of sounds, including children’s laughter and sounds from nature, with the audience. 
The title and main character of the musical, “Beatlekkaebi” was coined by combining the word “Beatles,” famous British music band and traditional Korean cartoon character “dokkaebi” (goblin).
Plot
Beatlekkaebis are members of the best band in Dokkaebimael, the goblin town. Their group is called the Dokkaebi Band. The flowers in Dokkaebimael only grow if they can hear beautiful sounds. So goblins have to collect beautiful sounds and let flowers listen to them. The Beatlekkaebis begin an adventure to a legendary mountain of sound, the Sori-Mountain. But along the way, they create a fuss and as a punishment, the flowers are cursed. To lift the curse and help them grow again, Beatlekkaebis travel the world to find the world’s most beautiful sound. 
The Kisable Musical Beatlekkaebi runs through June 2nd at Gwacheon National Science Museum in Gyeonggi province.
