Singing astronaut becomes YouTube sensation
Chris Hadfield, 53, a former Royal Canadian Air Force colonel and the first Canadian to command the International Space Station, ended 146 days in zero-gravity and returned to Earth, National Public Radio (NPR) reported on May 18. 
The Soyuz capsule carrying him and two fellow astronauts landed safely at 08:31 a.m. on May 13 in Kazakhstan. 
The Canadian astronaut is probably one of the most popular astronauts of modern times, thanks to the music recordings he posted on YouTube before he left the International Space Station. 
Let alone carrying more than 1 million Twitter followers, his videos in the ISS -- ranging from his own rendition of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” sung in front of a backdrop of the rotating Earth, to simple recordings about his day-to-day life -- became a genuine online hit. They have been watched by millions of viewers.
He also snapped many jaw-dropping pictures and shared them with millions: thunderstorms engulfing the Amazon, huge mining pits on the red soil of China and North America’s Great Lakes taken in a single shot. 
Still, some criticized that the astronaut wasted his valuable time in space shooting amateur videos while he should have focused more on accomplishing important tasks, such as doing scientific experiments. 
“I came here on behalf of so many people. It’s just too good an experience to keep to yourself,” Hadfield wrote before leaving space. This astronaut just hoped to pay tribute to his time in space to inspire others to follow his footsteps, NPR explained. In effect, Chris Hadfield’s most excellent space mission was to remind people what human beings can do in space, the report added.
