New wave of Hallyu, K-beauty
It has been quite a while since the cultural drive Hallyu, also called the Korean Wave, started to influence global people in every facet of life, from music, movies and drama to sports and fashion.
What has received less attention but is expected to contribute greatly to the Korean vogue is so-called “K-beauty,” including plastic surgery and skin care.
The largest group of K-beauty consumers is Chinese people. News reports say many tourists from China these days visit the Gangnam or Apgujeong areas to receive plastic surgery and go to Myeong-dong to enjoy shopping during the intermission.
The reason that Chinese people visit Korea to improve their appearance instead of receiving less expensive beauty care services in their country is Korea’s supreme technology in the field.
The number of foreign tourists to Korea for medical purposes surpassed 150,000 in April and Chinese people topped the list, followed by Americans, said the government.
More than 30,000 Chinese people came to Korea in 2012 to receive medical treatment, and a third of them were in to receive cosmetic surgery or skin care.
The foreign patients are said to request that doctors change their face to resemble famous Hallyu or K-pop stars.
Before, the largest group of foreign patients in Korea was U.S. soldiers stationed in 
he country, but they have been recently replaced by Chinese tourists.
Another reason that Korean beauty care is popular among Chinese tourists is its cost. A news report said that an average medical expense for a foreign patient per visit was 1.5 million won. Foreign patients are said to express satisfaction with the reasonable price and service.
Considering China’s rapid economic growth and subsequent rise in their quality of life, the number of incoming tourists from the country for beauty care will continue to rise, experts predict.
