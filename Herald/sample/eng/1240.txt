Shirt that can save you from tedious laundry; now you can wash it three times a year!
Here’s some good news for lazy college students, businessmen or even housewives. A U.S. fashion start up, Wool making a shirt that only needs to be cleaned three times a year. 
Inspiration for the 100-day shirt came from jeans, Bishop told during an interview with the paper. “Guys love their jeans, [which] are low-maintenance, but there was not an option like that for button-downs.” With two of his friends, he founded the company. 
He claims the secret behind the shirt‘s durability is finely spun wool -- the kind frequently used in an Italian suit. The special fabric absorbs sweat more efficiently than other fabric; quickly evaporating sweat into air before bacteria develops, thus making it odor-resistant. Usually, it is sweat that creates bacteria which give off stinky smells in the garment. 
Therefore, the fine-spun wool button-down shirt is supposed to last for 100 days without washing, he insisted. On top of that, the shirt does not need ironing thanks to its wrinkle-free properties.
Currently the $98 shirt is the sole item this New York City company is selling. However, Bishop plans to make more than just shirts in the future. “We want to see how people will respond to these shirts first, then we will develop other products.”
Unfortunately, the report added that the 100-day shirt is already sold out due to pre-orders.
