Comedian Kim Byung-man, more than just a master on TV
The “master” Kim Byung-man made headlines recently after an episode of SBS’ “Law of the Jungle in the Himalayas” wherein he was shown earning five different certifications, including an advanced open water certification in skin-scuba diving and a level 2 freediving certification. 
The comedian had made a name for himself by playing a “master” of various random acts during the highly popular but now discontinued “Master Show” corner of the hit KBS comedy show “Gag Concert,” including “master of dodging,” “master of balloon heading,” and “master of not feeling cold.” 
In fact, for a little under three years, Kim had cultivated a following by combining slapstick comedy with his undeniable talent for being able to master seemingly any physical activity within a very short period of time. 
In the recent episode of “Law of the Jungle in the Himalayas” aired on May 17, Kim was shown earning an astounding five different certifications, much to the amazement of viewers. After learning and successfully performing various skydiving techniques, ranging from the basic arched position to the more difficult back loop, Kim was able to earn a skydiving "A License” in record time. 
In addition to becoming a certified skydiver, Kim also earned various certifications related to skin-scuba diving. By earning both open water diver and advanced open water certifications in scuba diving, Kim is now a full-fledged diver. Kim also earned certifications in free diving, allowing him to dive up to 30 meters under the water without the aid of an oxygen tank or any other diving equipment.
