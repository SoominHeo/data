Raha Moharra becomes first Saudi woman to conquer Mount Everest
A 27-year-old graphic designer from Saudi Arabia made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to scale the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest (8,848 m), in Katumandu, Nepal.
“I really don‘t care about being the first, so long as it inspires someone else to be the second,” Raha Moharrak, who lives in Dubai is quoted as saying on the expedition’s website, Arabs on Top of the World.
She said that coming from a traditional and conservative family made it hard to “convince them to let her climb” and it was “as great a challenge as the mountain itself.” She said now her family fully supports her.
Her inspiring feat did not come easy; she went through hard and steady preparations. She trained months for the expedition; in February, she conquered Argentina’s highest peak, Aconcagua and had stayed in Nepal since April to get accustomed to the high altitude.
Moharrak was among the 64 climbers who reached the top of the mountain on May 18. 
The team consisted of several Arab women – Moharrak herself, Qatari Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani, Palestinian Raed Zidan and Iranian Masoud Mohammad. They aim to raise $1 million to support Reach Out to Asia’s educational projects in Nepal.
Her accomplishment is one of the latest efforts to bring change in women’s lives in the conservative Arab nation. Earlier this month, officials permitted sports in private girls’ schools for the first time in Saudi history.
Just last year, the ultra-conservative kingdom sent its first female athletes to the 2012 Olympic Games. Sarah Attar competed in the 800m and Wodjan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani in the judo competition, wearing traditional women’s attire. 
In 2011 in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi women campaigned for the right to drive, protesting against male-only driving rule.
