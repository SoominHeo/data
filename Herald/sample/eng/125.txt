Michael Jackson’s doctor on trial
Circumstances surrounding the death of "King of Pop" Michael Jackson, made headlines again as the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray began on Sept. 27. 
Murray was the personal physician of Jackson at the time of his death. He is currently on trial for involuntary manslaughter, having been accused of giving Jackson a lethal dose of the sedative propofol on the night of his death. 
The trial is estimated to last between four and six weeks. As of Sept. 29, opening speeches were given by both the prosecution and defense, a recording of Jackson’s slurred speech near the end of his life was played, and the first witness had been called.마이클 잭슨 주치의 재판
