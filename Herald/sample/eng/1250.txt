Parents spend W300m for my education
The government said that it costs over 300 million won to rear a child from cradle to college.
According to a survey of about 20,000 households nationwide, it cost around 309 million won to raise a kid until college graduation.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare in charge of the research added that the largest chunk of the whole cost was spent for college education (77 million won), followed by elementary school education (76 million won).
Monthly household budget for children’s education stood at 1.2 million won, a third of which was spent for extracurricular private education. The monthly educational budget has constantly risen from 750,000 won in 2003, 910,000 won in 2006 and 1 million won in 2009.
The survey also asked other questions regarding people’s thoughts on marriage, child birth, family health and so on.
It turned out that more married couples wanted to have a baby girl than before. Their gender preference ratio for a girl and a boy was 100 to 86.
As to the necessity of marriage, 65 percent and 57 percent of men and women said it is necessary. Twenty-six percent of male respondents said marriage is absolutely necessary while about half of the women, or 13 percent, said so.
The ministry said it plans to increase financial support for people’s child birth and rearing so that it could reach the government’s goal of increasing childbirth and improving public heath.
