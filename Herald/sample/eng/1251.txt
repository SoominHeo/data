Secrets of chewing gum
Legendary Manchester soccer manager Alex Ferguson retired recently. He famously used to chew gum every match to help his concentration and to release anxiety. The gum he chewed during his last match was auctioned off at a whopping 390,000 pounds ($600,000). 
Chewing gum dates back to ancient Greece, where people used wads of mastic tree resin to sweeten their breath. And there was a sound rationale to this behavior; there are many benefits in gum chewing that we have not been aware of, researchers point out.
According to a study published in British Journal of Psychology on March 8, chewing gum helps you concentrate. Researchers of Cardiff University in Wales suggest chewing gum helps you stay focused on tasks for a long period of time.
In the study, 38 people were split into two groups. For thirty minutes, both groups listened to a list of numbers from 1-9 in a random order. In this audio task, participants who chewed gum had quicker reactions and more accurate results than those who didn’t chew gum. 
“Interestingly, participants who didn’t chew gum performed slightly better at the beginning of the task but were overtaken by the end. This suggests that chewing gum helps us focus on tasks that require continuous monitoring over a longer amount of time,” said Kate Morgan, lead author of the study.
In a February study by Japan’s National Institute of Radiological Science, brain function of 17 adults aged 20-34 was monitored through magnetic resonance imaging. The results showed people who chewed gum had an average 10 percent faster response time (493 milliseconds) to participants who had not chewed gum (544 milliseconds). The study notes chewing gum increases flow of blood and allows more oxygen to reach the brain, and therefore facilitates brain function. 
These studies suggest it might not be so wise to scold others for chewing gum at home, school and work, since gum boosts people’s mental performance.
