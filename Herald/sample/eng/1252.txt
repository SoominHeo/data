Children favor working moms over homemakers
In a recent poll conducted by Women Up (http://wrd.seoulwomen.or.kr), about 46.8 percent of elementary and middle school students in the Seoul area said they preferred working mothers to homemakers. 
The organization surveyed 2,012 elementary and middle school students in the nation’s capital in April. In the poll, 46.8 percent of students responded they favor working moms over stay-at-home moms. The proportion of students who disliked working moms was 31.8 percent and 21.4 percent of them showed no preference.
Women Up stated on May 9 that kids possess mostly positive images toward their working mothers, with 36.6 percent of them saying working mothers “look cool” and 35.2 percent noting they “look classy.” But 65.2 percent said working moms look “tired,” trying to juggle between their profession and housework.
Majority of them saw mothers with jobs as “cool and talented individual” (34.9 percent). Other reasons for favoring a working mother followed by “Being a good help with my studies” (26.4 percent), “Offering more freedom and less interference” (12.3 percent), and “Giving a large allowance” (9.6 percent). 
The biggest reason behind not liking working moms was that they were not at home to greet them when they came back from school.
The survey showed that half of children developed the desire to work when they grow up, a telltale sign of working mothers’ influence on their young children.
The result is also supported by a 2011 study by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) on maternal employment and child socio-emotional behavior in the U.K. 
The research showed that, contrary to common beliefs, moms’ work has no significant detrimental effects on a child’s social or emotional development. In fact, the study noted the ideal scenario for kids’ social development was when both of their parents were working and striving to combine paid work with housework.
