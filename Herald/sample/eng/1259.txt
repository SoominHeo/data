Korean students perpetually tired due to sleep deprivation
A surprising percentage of students in Korea are not getting enough sleep, leaving them perpetually tired, according to research data released by the Gyeonggi Educational Research Institute (GERI) on May 27. 
Data was gathered from a survey of 11,834 students from 212 elementary, middle and high schools in the Gyeonggi province to identify students’ sleeping patterns. 
According to the survey results, high school students got the least amount of sleep on average. Forty-two percent of high school students reported going to bed between midnight and 1 a.m., while 38 percent reported getting up between 6:30 and 7 a.m. 
On the other hand, though 47 percent of middle school students and 50 percent of elementary school students reported getting up between 7 and 7:30 a.m., middle school students were found to get less sleep. In fact, 44 percent of middle school students reported going to bed between 11 p.m. and midnight while 57 percent of elementary school students reported sleeping between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. 
The results indicate that high school students get an average of 5.5 to 7 hours of sleep a day compared to middle and elementary school students who average 9 to 9.5 hours and 7 to 8.5 hours, respectively. 
Based on the results, it is not surprising that a whopping 24 percent of high school students reported falling asleep in class almost every day compared to the 7 percent who responded with “I never fall asleep in class.” 
The GERI results bring to light a major problem in Korea’s educational system. While social and academic pressures are causing students to spend an average of 1 million won a month on after-school academies, they are also falling asleep in class due to sleep deprivation.
