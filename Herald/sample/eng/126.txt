Nesat devastates Asia
Typhoon Nesat left devastation at its wake in the Philippines, Hong Kong and China before it headed towards Vietnam. 
Nesatâ€™s journey began by leaving at least 35 dead and 45 missing in the Philippines before it shut down government offices, the stock market and schools in Hong Kong. In China, 300,000 people were forced to evacuate as Typhoon Nesat landed in Hainan province on Sept. 29, before moving on to hit the coastal provinces of Vietnam on Sept. 30.
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama, another typhoon, Nalgae, has been forming off the coast of the Philippines and is also moving towards Vietnam.
