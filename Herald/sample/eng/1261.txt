Massive online money laundering uncovered
Riding on technical advances and efficiency, criminals are becoming more daring and smarter in the ways they commit crimes, especially financial fraud.
It was reported on May 29 that a cyber money fraud of $6 billion (6.8 trillion won) took place in the United States, the largest amount to date in the country.
Criminals used cyber money called “Liberty Reserve” in order to launder money from drug sales, illegal video circulation and investment fraud.
Liberty Reserve, which is commonly called LR, is circulated all around the world, and its headquarters is in Costa Rica, a Latin American country bordered by Nicaragua to the North and Panama to the South.
Earlier in February, a host of illegal withdrawals were reported in 26 countries, and a total of $45 million disappeared from cash machines. The stolen money was traced back to the $6 billion money laundering scheme.
It is said that over 1 million criminals all over the world took advantage of LR to launder their illicit money. Around 55 million illegal cyber transactions occurred alongside this massive fraud, news reports said.
Though the LR website was forcibly closed by the U.S. law enforcement authorities including the Department of Justice, the issue of illegal money laundering will not be solved in the near future and needs more attention, said news reports.
What is money laundering? 
Money laundering is the process of concealing illegal sources of money. It occurs when a group of criminals makes money out of illegal arms sales, smuggling, embezzlement or computer fraud and tries to hide how they made their fortune by disguising the source.
