Psy helps promote Korean tourism
Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) announced on June 3 that advertisements for Korean tourism featuring Psy began airing on foreign TV channels.
The Korean rapper, best known for his global hit, “Gangnam Style,” made an impressive appearance in the ads, where he introduced interesting aspects of Korean culture, in particular the culture of today’s Korea, to international viewers.
He taught the expression “Bulgum,” meaning burning Friday in Korean to viewers, which implies an enthusiastic and passionate way of spending Friday night. Other expressions Psy shared included, “Ollegil,” the beautiful walking course on Jeju Island and “Cosme-road” in Myeong-dong, where tons of cosmetics stores are located.
The title of the 15-second ad is “PSY’s Wiki Korea,” co-opting the name of free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. There are six parts to the ad.
KTO has created advertisements each year to introduce Korea to the world. This year, the organization sought to convey three main cultural elements, “gi” (spirit), “heung” (joy), “jeong” (affection), and decided to use Psy as the face of the project. The KTO said Psy’s involvement made the ad the embodiment of joy and fun and that it would grab international travelers’ attention.
The international ads by KTO are famous for conveying the unique charm of Korea to the world. Last year’s ad, “Touch Korea” was picked as one of 10 best ads by Singapore’s biggest media corporation, Media Corp.
“KTO will further promote Korea’s attractiveness through TV and online social networking services and help bring in more tourists to Korea,” said Lee Charm, CEO of KTO.
