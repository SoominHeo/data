Oldest recorded case of child abuse discovered in ancient Egyptian cemetery
The 2,000 year-old remains of a child found in Egypt may be the oldest recorded case of physical child abuse in history, LiveScience reported on May 28.
According to archaeologists, the remains of a 2 to 3-year-old, known only as “burial 519,” show signs of having repeatedly had her bones broken and being shaken violently. The remains were discovered by researchers during an excavation of a cemetery in Dakhla Oasis, Egypt, an area that has been continuously occupied by humans since the Neolithic period.
After running numerous tests to confirm their suspicions, the team assert that the sad discovery is the first recorded case of child abuse in history.
The find is especially unique in that of the 158 children’s remains excavated from the cemetery, only “Burial 519” showed signs of repeated non-accidental trauma. This suggests that child abuse wasn’t something that occurred throughout the community, supporting the general belief that children were considered a valued part of ancient Egyptian society.
On the other hand, while the Romans were believed to have loved their children immensely, they also believed that children were born soft and weak. Therefore it was the parents’ duty to mold them into adults through such practices as immobilizing newborn infants on wooden planks to ensure proper growth and routinely bathing young children in cold water.
“We know that the ancient Egyptians really revered children,” lead researcher Sandra Wheeler told LiveScience. “But we don’t know how much Roman ideas filtered into Egyptian society.” Wheeler and her team suggest that this unique case of child abuse may have been as a result of Roman influence.
The research will be published in an upcoming issue of the International Journal of Paleopathology.
