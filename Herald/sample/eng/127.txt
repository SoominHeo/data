Seoul to triple food exports by 2017
The South Korean government is planning to triple its food and agricultural exports to $20 billion by 2017, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on Sept. 28.
 An industry report stated that the global food market is valued at $4.9 trillion, but last year’s South Korea’s food and agricultural exports were valued at $5.9 billion, a mere 1 percent of the country’s overall exports of $467.4 billion.
 According to a press release made by the ministry, the global food market is likely to reach $6.4 trillion in 2020 because of an “increase in global population” and “growth of newly emerging countries.” 
 Korean government is planning to adopt the “Food Industry Development Plan” to enlarge the country’s food industry from 131 trillion won in 2009 to 245 trillion won in 2017. With the plan, the administration will increase its funding for the industries’ research and development and rev up its aid to private companies from last year’s 25 billion won to 400 billion won in 2017.
