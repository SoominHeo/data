Musical ‘Dancing Scarecrow’ to greet audiences at local culture and art center
Sejong Center for the Performing Arts and Seoul Metropolitan Theater have teamed up for a series of performances. 
In the efforts, nine art organizations and 16 culture and art centers in Seoul have decided to cooperate and coordinate their skills in introducing quality performances to the local community audiences in a familiar way.
The project was initiated last year, when it put on a total of 58 shows and drew 17,000 audience members. Pushing the envelope, this year, the project aims to put on 95 performances at culture and art centers around the city.
In the month of June, “Europe music tour” by Seoul Metropolitan Junior Chorus, “Dancing Scarecrow” by Seoul Metropolitan Dance Theater, “Butcher” by Seoul Metropolitan Theater, and “Our Happy Sound” by Seoul Metropolitan Traditional Music Orchestra are scheduled to run at culture and art centers in Seoul, including Naru, Yangcheon, Gangseo, Gangbok culture and art centers and Guro Arts Valley. 
Among the shows slated for June, comic dance musical, “Dancing Scarecrow” will greet audiences at the culture and art center in Yangcheon-gu on June 20 and 21. 
The non-verbal, family dance musical was first shown at Sejong Center for Performing Arts from May 1 to May 5. The joyful percussion beat, beautiful dancing and humorous plot complete the show. 
The show talks about a pure and innocent girl named Yeonhee who joins a scarecrow to fight against a land developer who tries to turn their countryside into a city. 
The admission for the show is 10,000 won. For more information about the upcoming show, call (02) 2620-3404.
