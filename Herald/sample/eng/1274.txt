Jose Mourinho returns to Chelsea
 “I have the same nature but I’m much more mature with a different approach to things, I’m more ready to be in a club and stay for a long time”. -- Jose Mourinho
Renowned Portuguese football coach Jose Mourinho has agreed to a four year deal to return to English Premier League powerhouse Chelsea as the club’s manager. Popularly known as “The Special One,” Mourinho is widely regarded as one of the finest football coaches of all time. He previously managed Chelsea from 2004 to 2007 and won two league titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups. He will become the highest paid manager in the Premier League with a reported annual salary of 8.5 million pounds ($13 million).
Jose Mourinho was born in Setubal, Portugal, in 1963. He was introduced to football at a young age by his father -- a professional player and coach. He played football in his youth but lacked the necessary speed and power to become a professional player. He decided to become a football coach instead. He attended the Instituto Superior de Educacao Fisica (ISEF), Technical University of Lisbon, to study sports science. He taught physical education at various schools for several years and worked as a youth team coach, a scout, and an assistant manager. He also attended coaching courses held by the English and Scottish Football Associations. 
Mourinho’s first major career opportunity came in 1992 when he was hired as a translator for Sir Bobby Robson, the new manager of Lisbon club Sporting CP. He followed Robson to FC Porto in 1993 and became his assistant coach. Working closely, the wily Englishman and the eager Portuguese upstart guided the team to the 1993-94 UEFA Champions League semifinals and won the 1994 Portuguese Cup, the 1994?95, the 1995?96 Portuguese championship, and the 1994, 1995 and 1996 Portuguese Super Cup. He followed Robson to FC Barcelona of Spanish La Liga in 1996 and became well known for his prowess in planning practice sessions and providing tactical advice.　
In September 2000, Mourinho became a top-tier coach for the first time when he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as the manager of Portuguese Primeira Liga club S.L. Benfica. However, he left the club in December, after only nine league games, when his demand for a contract extension was refused. In April, 2001, Mourinho was hired as the manager of Uniao de Leiria, and he promptly guided the small market club to their highest-ever league finish of fifth place. His accomplishments caught the attention of larger league clubs and a year later, he was appointed the manager of FC Porto. He led the club to a Primeira Liga title and won the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup final in 2003.
Mourinho became a big time football coach in 2004 when English Premier League club Chelsea made him the highest paid manager in football with an annual salary of 4.2 million pounds. With the deep pockets of the club’s billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich, Mourinho assembled a star-studded team that included Tiago, Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Mateja Kezman, Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira. He led the powerful team to their first Premier League title in 50 years (2004?05) and a repeat in the following season (2005?06), two League Cups (2004?05, 2006?07), and an FA Cup (2006?07). He left Chelsea on Sept. 20 2007 due to a series of disagreements with club chairman Roman Abramovich. 
On June 2, 2008, Mourinho signed a three-year contract to become the manager of Italian Serie A club Inter Milan. He won the league title and the Italia Super Cup in his first season. In the 2009-2010 season, the team became the first Italian club to win the “Treble” -- Serie A, Coppa Italia, UEFA Champions League. On May 28, 2010, Mourinho became the manager of one of the most famous and the most successful clubs in the world -- Real Madrid of the Spanish La Liga. Wherever he went, trophies followed -- he won the Copa del Rey (2011), La Liga (2011?12) and Supercopa de Espana (2012).
