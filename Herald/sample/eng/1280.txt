Tiffany scores kisses on the cheek from Brad Pitt during interview
Tiffany of SNSD, one of nation’s most popular girl groups, ran a charming interview with Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt for SBS entertainment news program, “One Night of TV Entertainment.”
Tiffany was a complete professional throughout the show. With her bright personality, she showed no sign of nervousness in encountering such a big world star and managed to add much of her personal charm to the interview. 
During the interview, she taught the 49-year-old actor how to say huge hit in Korean -- “daebak” -- hoping his latest film will be a box office success here. She also asked him to say hi to another SNSD member and co-host of the program, Sooyoung, as her crush on the star was well known by group members. 
Brad Pitt shared his profound interest in Korean history in the interview and above all, his unquenchable love for the traditional dish, galbi. He mentioned that he brought nine-year-old son Pax along with him to visit Korea just to give him a taste of the popular Korean barbecue.
The interview with Brad Pitt took place at the Geunjeongjeon in Gyeongbok Palace. He is the first foreign entertainer to be interviewed there. Brad Pitt also met local fans at a red carpet event at Cheonggye Plaza, central Seoul on the same day. 
His latest flick, “World War Z” is a blockbuster thriller about a former United Nations employee struggling to save the Earth from a zombie pandemic. It shows how the human race fights to survive a mysterious disaster. It hit theaters nationwide on June 20.
