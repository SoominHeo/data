Over 10m children work as domestic servants globally
There are as many as 10.5 million children worldwide, mostly girls, working as domestic servants, the International Labor Organization (ILO) said in a report recently. 
Released on June 12 to mark World Day Against Child Labor, the reality outlined in the 87-page report flies in the face of international efforts to halt such exploitation, said Constance Thomas, director of the ILO’s global program to eliminate child labor.
“The situation of many child domestic workers not only constitutes a serious violation of rights, but remains an obstacle to the achievement of many national and international development objectives,” said Thomas.
The U.N. labor agency said that almost three-quarters of children working as domestic servants were girls, and that 6.5 million child servants are between 5 and 14 years old. Their tasks generally include cleaning, ironing, cooking, gardening, looking after other children and caring for the elderly. Often isolated from their families and hidden from the public eye, these children tend to become highly dependent on their employers. 
According to the ILO, child domestic work is a problematic issue as it is not recognized as a form of child labor in many countries because of the blurred relationship with the employing family. The report explains that child domestic servants are not often considered workers nor treated as family members despite living in a family setting.
Meanwhile, in a message to mark World Day Against Child Labor, Pope Francis told those gathered in St. Peter’s Square that “there are millions of minors, mostly young girls, who are victims of this form of hidden exploitation which often includes sexual abuse, poor treatment and discrimination.”
“It is slavery!” he said, adding that “All children should be able to play, study, pray and grow, in their own families, in a harmonious environment, one of love and serenity. It is their right and our duty”
