Violist throws eggs on British music guru
An English viola player in a black dress made headlines on June 8 as she threw eggs at a pop music guru during a TV singing competition.
Natalie Holt, a 30-year-old violist playing in a string quartet, unleashed five eggs at the Britain’s Got Talent (BGT) judges including British entrepreneur Simon Cowell, according to MSN news on June 10.
Holt was performing with her quartet Raven to support the contestants Richard and Adam Johnson, and suddenly jumped up on the stage and started throwing eggs at the judge.
The violist, who apparently had smile on her face while pulling the stunt, later told British reporters that she took a stand against people miming on TV, news reports said.
But people raised questions as to why she decided to step in at that time, when Richard and Johnson were not actually lip synching or miming.
In fact, Holt’s quartet Raven participated in BGT last year, but they failed to make it to the live stage of the program, The Sun explained.
Even so, some experts faulted Simon Cowell‘s “manipulation” of Britain’s music industry.
Alison Phillips, a columnist at The Mirror, wrote on June 12 that Holt held the ammunition the British public have been searching for to tell Cowell what British people think of his control of their TV schedules.
Philips went on to say that Cowell has been “fooling a generation of kids into thinking that being famous is the greatest thing they can aspire to.”
She also wrote in the column: “We listeners are left with a succession of bland, dull singers.”
The viola player is said to have apologized to Johnson brothers after the incident and confessed that she had never realized how silly her act was.
