One-armed woman wins Miss Iowa title
This year’s Miss Iowa is even more unique and special than usual; that is to say, she’s not your typical beauty queen. Nicole Kelly, this year’s winner of Miss Iowa, has been born without her left forearm. Yet, it did not stop her from searching for her dream and can now proudly call herself Miss Iowa of 2013.
In the three-day competition that took place in Denport on June 8, the 23-year-old beauty impressed everyone not only with her mesmerizing beauty but her positive and confident self.
Now with her newly won title and the platform of “overcoming disabilities” that came along with, Kelly hopes she could encourage and support those who are struggling with being different. 
Initially she did not consider herself capable of winning a pageant. Kelly earned a degree in directing and theater management from Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln last year. She worked as an intern on Broadway performing hit song from “Defying Gravity” from “Wicked.” 
But, Kelly writes on her Facebook page -- ‘Meet Miss Iowa,’ -- “I now know that being Miss Iowa is the perfect fit for me. ... Giving a voice to my platform, “Overcoming Disabilities,” is a tremendous honor, and I am thrilled to continue my adventure by speaking out and touching lives.” 
Being on stage is when she feels most liberated, Kelly notes. “As I grew older, I learned to offset the initial stares I received ... I found my passion within a world where I was giving people permission to stare … the stage. It was the place that was kind of an outlet for me, a place I could stand up and be myself, and say, ‘Here I am, and I’m confident in myself.’”
This ambitious beauty queen aspires to be a Broadway stage manager one day. But for now, she will have to compete for the title of Miss America on Sept. 15 in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
