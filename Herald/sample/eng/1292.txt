Football superstar Park Ji-sung announces relationship with Kim Min-ji
Korean football superstar Park Ji-sung confirmed that he has been in a relationship with SBS announcer Kim Min-ji since the beginning of summer at a press conference in his hometown of Suwon on June 20.
It was his first public appearance since photos showing the couple on a date along the Han River were published by Sports Seoul, a local sports daily, on June 19.
Park, 32, revealed that the two first met in 2011 at his father’s suggestion. Although many have speculated that the two started their relationship as early as last year and that a wedding announcement was imminent, Park said the relationship was still in its early stages. 
“I first met her in 2011 without knowing what her job was,” Park said. “We remained close friends until last season and we didn’t start our relationship until I returned to Korea at the end of May.”
Additionally, Park addressed rumors of a July wedding, saying they are “groundless.” 
“Unless I retire from the sport, there is no way I would get married this July since it falls within the preparatory period for the European football season,” Park explained.
When asked about Kim’s appeal, Park responded that “there was nothing really specific,” but rather he had already fallen for her. 
“In my eyes, she [Kim] is the most lovable woman,” Park added.
Kim, who joined the local network SBS in 2010, currently co-hosts a weekly football show with fellow announcer Bae Sung-jae. 
Park, a former captain of the Korean national football team, currently plays in midfield for Queens Park Rangers, where he moved to after seven years at Manchester United.
