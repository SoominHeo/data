Samsung unveils Ativ Q, Galaxy S4 Mini in London
The Galaxy S4 Mini and the Ativ Q tablet were among the smartphones and tablet PCs that Samsung Electronics unveiled in London on June 20. 
The main attraction was the convertible laptop Ativ Q with dual-booting technology allowing users to operate on both Windows 8 and Android 4.2.2 operating systems.
The Ativ Q weighs 1.29 kilograms and measures 13.9 millimeters at its thinnest point. The resolution is nearly three times crisper than a full-HD display. 
At the event, Samsung also unveiled the new Galaxy S4 Mini, which is 20 percent lighter than the original S4, adopting a smaller 4.3-inch screen.
The first smartphone to incorporate a 10x optical zoom lens, the new Galaxy S4 Zoom, as well as the Android-powered mirrorless camera, Galaxy NX were also showcased.
“Developing new products with diverse lifestyles and consumer demands in mind has increased synergy,” said Lee Don-joo, keynote speaker and head of strategic marketing for Samsung Electronics’ mobile business unit. 
Samsung officials said the venue for the launch was a good choice, as British consumers had picked Samsung as No. 1 brand in the electronics field for the past three years.
On June 19, Samsung was awarded the “Best Computing Brand” of 2013 by “Which?” ― the U.K.’s largest consumer group ― for its level of product innovation and the customer satisfaction with its products. 
The new devices are expected to go on sale between July and September in Korea and worldwide.
