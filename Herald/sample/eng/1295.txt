Google wants to bring Internet to every corner of the Earth
Not long after stunning the world with its cutting-edge Web-surfing eyeglasses, Google has come up with another pleasant surprise, this time with its Internet-beaming balloons. 
In the hope of making the Internet more affordable and bringing more remote areas to free access of the Internet, Google is striving to launch Internet-beaming balloons high above the sky. 
The giant jellyfish-shaped balloons will be loaded with Internet antennas which will beam off a 3G Internet signal. They will float in the stratosphere above 60,000 feet (18,300 meters), twice as high as airplanes, meaning rugged terrain won’t be a problem, Google notes. The so-called Project Loon could also be tremendously helpful during natural disasters, allowing smooth communication. 
Google estimates two-thirds of the world population is without fast, affordable Internet access and hopes the balloons will narrow the digital divide between the 2.2 billion people who have access to the Internet and the 4.8 billion who don‘t --- most of whom live in places such as Africa and Southeast Asia. 
The project is still in experimental stages but when it was revealed on June 16 in New Zealand for the first time, some 50 volunteer households in the country had successfully received the Internet connection on their home computers via the balloons.
“It’s a huge moonshot, a really big goal to go after,” said project leader Mike Cassidy. “The power of the Internet is probably one of the most transformative technologies of our time.”
“Whole segments of the population would reap enormous benefits, from social inclusion to educational and economic opportunities,” Media Studies professor Kevin Howley from DePauw University said.
