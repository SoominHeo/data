Explore the wonders of the human body with ‘Science Show The Body’
In a futuristic exhibition that explores the intricacies of the human body, the “Science Show The Body” exhibition at the War Memorial of Korea in Yongsan opened its doors on April 5.
Bringing to life the many wonders of the human body, the “Science Show The Body” exhibition provides an immersive experience to visitors that allows for understanding science in a more direct and fun way.
By removing as much of the difficult scientific theories and explanations as possible in the exhibits themselves, the exhibition provides visitors with a chance to gain understanding directly through visual and auditory experiences as they walk through the many exhibits. For example, rather than read countless informational pamphlets on how the body works, visitors can see firsthand the body’s nervous system, blood vessels, bones and other structures superimposed onto their own bodies through an augmented reality exhibition. 
The “Science Show The Body” exhibition also provides a three-meter 3-D video image of how different muscles and joints are used by athletes going through different motions. In fact, there are eight large hologram theaters that provide visitors with a chance to better understand their bodies by showing the movements of the human body’s various vital organs. 
In general, science-based exhibitions tend to be geared toward younger audiences. This exhibition, however, attempts to appeal to a wider audience, both children and adults, through its unique program. In fact, the exhibition has been recognized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism-affiliated Korea Creative Content Agency for its exceptional use of virtual reality content.
The “Science Show The Body” exhibition is set to run until March 2, 2014. Tickets are available on Interpark.
