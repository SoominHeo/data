Efforts to end school violence found to be inadequate
The Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) announced on June 26 that education authorities have failed to take appropriate action to protect at-risk students from school violence.
In an audit of the Ministry of Education and six provincial education offices, the BAI found that school authorities had failed to take preventive and follow-up measures against school violence. The audit was conducted between Feb. 27 and April 11 after a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education showed a disturbing number of bullying incidents in classrooms across the nation.
The survey was carried out in 2012 on 6.6 million elementary, middle and high school students. Of the 6.6 million students surveyed, 37 percent of respondents showed signs of bullying while 35 percent showed signs of being bullied. 
Despite the findings of the survey, the BAI stated in its audit report that education authorities did not take adequate follow-up measures such as counseling. For instance, the BAI stated that the lack of available counseling services in Daejeon and Ulsan resulted in 226 of the 12,088 students surveyed later becoming involved in school violence, either as a bully or victim.
The BAI audit was conducted as a result of the fact that government measures to prevent school violence failed to show much progress. 
According to the latest government survey, some 8.5 percent of students nationwide reported having experienced school violence. Of the 8.5 percent, 33.9 percent reported suffering verbal abuse from their peers. Additionally, 16.2 percent reported experiencing financial extortion while 11.4 percent experienced being ostracized by their peers.
