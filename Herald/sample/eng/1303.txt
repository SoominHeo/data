Palestinian wins Arab Idol
At the final of “Arab Idol,” a Middle East version of the U.S. talent show, “American Idol,” a 23-year-old Palestinian Mohammed Assaf claimed a touching victory, BBC News reports on June 22.
Before appearing on the competition, Assaf was an anonymous Palestinian student and wedding singer without a future. But now he became an icon of the Palestinian dream. 
His victory means a lot as he comes from a refugee camp in the south of Gaza, where there is virtually zero hope. The humble Khan Younis refugee camp where he came from is even poor by the Gazan standard, poverty and unemployment rates are high, BBC report points out. 
It is a tough neighborhood to grow up in, being the center of conflict with Israel. Young men frequently turn into militants fighting against the Islamist group, Hamas, which imposes strict restrictions on the people there. 
Thinking of traveling abroad, much less auditioning for a singing talent show was, therefore, improbable. Yet he won the show and his victory gave hope to millions who watched the show in the volatile region.
“It‘s very rare for a Palestinian from Gaza to participate in such a program. I love that it goes against the stereotypical image and shows Palestinians are engaged in art, music and singing,” one Assaf fan stated. 
He came to represent all the Palestinian people, his brother Shadi Assaf says. “Mohammed Assaf is a simple, straightforward person - like anyone of us in the camp.” 
During the contest, Assaf gave a wide range of performances -- from renditions of patriotic songs to catchy pop music such as Backstreet Boys’ “I want it that way.” His last solo song on the final stage on June 22 in Beirut, was “Alli al-keffiyah” which bore a critical political message, calling for reconciliation in the Gaza Strip. 
To Assaf, holding concerts in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is his next dream.
