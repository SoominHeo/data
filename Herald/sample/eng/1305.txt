Will royal baby pep up sagging U.K. economy?
The baby of a British royal due this month is expected to give a much anticipated boost to the country’s flagging economy, according to Reuters.
The baby fever could boost the U.K. economy by nearly $380 million, local finance analysts estimated. Some 4.8 million Britons are expected to spend 62 million pounds ($100 million) on drink and 25 million pounds on food to celebrate the arrival of the royal baby.
Already the British royal family is churning out baby products. Prince Charles, the grandfather-to-be and first in line to throne, is selling handmade baby shoes in his country estate of Highgrove. The parents of Duchess of Cambridge, Carole and Michael Middleton, added a baby product line to the family’s party goods business. Across the continent, numerous items have also begun to hit stores. A baby sleeping outfit that resembles guardsman’s get-up is one of many that have gone on sale.
“I think the biggest commercial opportunity is going to be with tourists,” Richard Cope, trends director at market researcher Mintel, forecast. He also expected good sales of souvenirs. “156 million pounds are to be spent on commemorative china and other collectables, toys, books, DVDs and media.” 
And there’s also the irresistible “Kate-effect,” which will create a positive impact on consumer spending, the report points out. Anything the duchess wears or uses will immediately fly off the shelves. New parents will copy her sense of style as the new baby comes. 
“The ‘Kate effect’ has already taken the fashion world by storm ... and this trend will follow for the infant’s baby grows, rattles, first bike and so on,” Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research (CRR), noted. 
Prince William and Kate Middleton tied the knot in April 2011. The new baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and the baby’s father, Prince William.
