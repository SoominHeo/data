Five reasons why you should have a pet
Pets are not just cute and fun to be around; they bring a bundle of positive health effects, the “Today Show” revealed on June 23. 
According to an animal expert and author of dozens of pet books Arden Moore, spending time with pets is beneficial to one’s overall well-being. “There’s something about the animal kingdom that possesses the ability for us to enjoy life a little better,” Moore commented on the show.
There are five “pet-prescriptions” that pets can help solve human’s problems.
First, when people pet or message their animals, it not only relaxes the pets but it can relax the owners as well. Touching releases feel-good endorphins in both animals and humans and this helps reduce humans’ heart rate. 
Second, when communicating with animals people tend to speak in an upbeat tone, so-called “happy talk.” Engaging in the bright communication makes people happier and it eventually lowers their blood pressure.
Third, pets serve therapeutic purposes; with them people laugh more, feel rejuvenated and having a strong human-animal bond makes human feel loved and appreciated.　
Fourth, eating in the company of an animal may improve people’s nutritional habits. “In nursing homes, if there’s a fish tank where people are eating, seeing those fish actually motivates some residents to eat,” the author suggested. 
Last but not least, having a good relationship with their pets spills over to their human relations. A 1997 study at the University of Michigan School of Nursing shows that animals help build valuable characteristics like patience. Also, by taking care of animal friends, humans learn to be more responsible, trustworthy, and open-minded.
For those who love to own pets but unable to do so because of problems with asthma or allergies, studies suggest other kinds of animals, such as goldfish or reptiles, serve almost identical purposes.
