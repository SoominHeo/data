Global caricature exhibition opens in Korea
The global caricature artist exhibition, “100 Local and International Individuals who are Loved by Koreans” opened at the Sejong Center’s Art Gallery in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, on June 27.
The purpose of the global caricature exhibition is to increase global artists’ interest in Korea and to bring artists and audiences closer. It is the second convention to be held in Korea since 2010. 
The exhibition is sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and International Society of Caricature Artists (ISCA). Established in 1989 in the U.S., the ISCA is a non-profit organization that focuses its efforts on informing and educating people about caricature. It holds contests, seminars, online caricature forums to teach techniques, theory, style, and ideas of caricature. It currently has member artists from 40 countries, specializing in caricatures. 
A total of 874 pieces of work by international artists and 1,646 by local artists will be on show. Pieces came from every corner of the world, including the U.S., Canada, Spain, Argentina, Belgium, France, Japan, India, China and Indonesia. And 212 pieces that passed the first round of elimination -- pieces depicting 36 politicians, 93 entertainers, 38 entrepreneurs, and 45 culture and sports personnel -- got the chance to go on display at the exhibit. Grand Prize winner will go home with $5,000 and the chance to be a member of the ISCA for a year. 
During the exhibition period from June 27 to July 29, there will be special seminars and lectures by world-renowned caricature artists, such as Jan op de Beeck of Belgium, Tomokazu Tabata of Japan, Marcus Sakoda of the U.S., and Anthony Geoffroy of France.
