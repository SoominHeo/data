Johnny Depp stars in ‘The Lone Ranger’
Starring in the latest Disney film, “The Lone Ranger,” prolific Hollywood actor Johnny Depp surprised fans recently when he revealed that he was “basically blind as a bat” in his left eye during a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine. 
Much like Korean rocker Kim Tae-won, Depp is famous for always wearing tinted glasses. The 50-year-old actor revealed to Rolling Stone magazine that he has struggled with eyesight issues since birth. 
Not only is he nearly blind in his left eye, he is also nearsighted in his right eye. Depp told the magazine that neither condition can be treated.
“Everything is just very, very blurry,” he said. “I’ve never had proper vision.”
In fact, unless he is lucky enough to have a scene in which his character dons eyewear, Depp, whose most famous roles include Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series and Edward Scissorhands, can only see a few inches away from his face during filming. 
But he got no help from glasses when playing his character in “The Lone Ranger.” In this latest film, Depp plays the character of “Tonto,” a Native American spirit warrior who seeks the help of John Reid (played by Armie Hammer) to bring justice to those responsible for destroying his tribe’s villages. 
“The Lone Ranger” hit theaters on July 4.
“The Lone Ranger” plot 
Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Gore Verbinski, “The Lone Ranger” is an action-packed film about seeking vengeance. Disillusioned by the death of his brother, ex-Texas Ranger John Reid reinvents himself as a masked vigilante that goes by the name of “The Lone Ranger.” Teaming up with the mysterious Tonto, the two set out on an explosive adventure to seek justice against the greedy and corrupt.
