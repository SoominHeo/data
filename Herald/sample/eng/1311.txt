The 16th Boryeong Mud Festival
The 16th annual Boryeong Mud Festival is set to kick off on July 19. 
Featured every year by foreign media outlets, the annual Boryeong Mud Festival draws more and more revelers from around the world. 
Within Korea itself, the Boryeong Mud Festival is often picked as the festival people enjoyed participating in the most. In fact, it is also often featured on many people’s bucket list of must-visit travel destinations within Korea. 
Providing a rare chance for people to relieve their pent-up stress and forget all their worries, the annual Boryeong Mud Festival is a cathartic experience for many. It offers adults the chance to revert back to childhood as they tumble around in the mud. As for the younger crowd, no particular explanation is necessary as to why the mud festival would be popular. 
Set to take place from July 19 to 28, this year’s festival will run for 10 days. Although the festival is set to run one day less than last year, the number of programs offered has grown from 56 to 59. 
Programs this year include the “Mud Super Slide,” “Prison of Mud,” “Kid’s Mudland,” “Mudflat Obstacle Marathon” and the “National Mud Futsal Championship.”
