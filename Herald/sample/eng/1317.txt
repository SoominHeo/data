Telescopic contact lenses invented
Researchers have created contact lenses that, when combined with special spectacles, can magnify details by 2.8 times, according the Huffington Post. 
The research on the world’s first telescopic contact lens was revealed in online journal Optics Express on July 2. Researchers describe in the study that the 1.17 mm-thick prototype contact lens contains two separate optical paths: one for 2.8-times magnified vision and one for regular vision. 
The central region of the lens allows wearers to obtain normal vision. The telescopic element is positioned in a ring around the lenses’ central area. The aluminum mirrors in the lens act as a magnifier, bouncing the light four times on its way to the retina.
According to Eric Tremblay, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, the lens also comes with a filtering system which blocks the magnified image in normal use. Thus, wearers can effectively zoom in and out whenever they want. The zoom-in function is controlled by a manual button on an accompanying set of 3-D television glasses, technology adopted from Korea’s Samsung Electronics, Tremblay noted. 
“The study aims to make the most of a person’s existing vision. Anything that helps to maximize functioning vision is very important” Clara Eaglen, eye health campaigns manager at the RNIB said.
The newest research is intended to help those who have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common age-related eye condition that makes recognizing faces and performing daily tasks such as driving and reading, which requires identifying details, difficult. Elderly people who suffer from the condition lose sharpness of vision and are unable to see objects clearly, the report noted.
Currently, 9.1 million Americans over the age of 40 suffer from AMD, according to the Macular Degeneration Association.
