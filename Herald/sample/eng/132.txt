Dead satellite falls in south Pacific with another set to fall soon
A dead NASA satellite which was expected to drop near Canada early Sept. 22, instead fell into the southern Pacific Ocean on Sept. 24, U.S. space officials said. 
Previously, the U.S. Air Force calculated that the 6-ton satellite would plunge thousands of kilometers from northwestern North America. 
 NASA explained that this 20-year-old satellite named “the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite” entered Earth’s atmosphere above American Samoa on Sept. 24. 
 “It fell into a relatively uninhabited portion of the world, very remote,” Mark Matney, NASA’s orbital debris scientist pointed out. “It is a good spot in terms of risk," he commented.
 Bill Ailor, director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at the Aerospace Corp. also joined the joyful mood, saying, "It’s just as good as it gets." Scientists are happy about how it turned out; falling into a remote area in the vast ocean, the report noted.
 Nicholas Johnson, orbital debris chief scientist in NASA forecast that it would be the largest debris to fall in the next 25 years. 
 Another warning came out from the CBS on Sept. 28 that a German astronomy satellite is also set to fall to Earth in late October or early November. 
 Although the German satellite is slightly smaller than UARS, scientists predicted that there would be more pieces falling.
 The German ROSAT satellite was launched in 1990 and died in 1998. It weighs 2.5 tons. The German space agency noted that the odds of people being struck by the debris of dead satellite are 1-in-14 trillion.
