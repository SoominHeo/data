Bieber to hit Korean stage for first time
Canadian pop star Justin Bieber, 19, who rose to superstardom after being discovered on YouTube, will be making his way to Korea for his first local concert on Oct. 10 at Seoul Olympic Park’s Gymnastics Stadium. 
The concert is part of the young singer’s “Believe World Tour” taking him to 39 different countries including the United Kingdom, Dubai, Germany and Turkey. Bieber is scheduled to perform 151 shows and attract around 1.8 million fans during his world tour. 
Bieber was first discovered in 2008 by the American talent manger Scooter Braun, who is also responsible for much of Korean rap star Psy’s international fame after his signing with the manager last year. 
Braun reportedly discovered one of Bieber’s videos on YouTube and signed the budding star. A year later, Bieber, who was only 15 at the time, released his debut seven-track EP titled “My World,” which went certified platinum in the United States. 
The official music video of Bieber’s first hit single “Baby” held the record as the most watched video on YouTube for more than two years before being dethroned by Psy’s mega hit “Gangnam Style” last November. “Baby” currently has more than 870 million views on YouTube.
Since his debut, Bieber has released three full-studio albums, including his most recent album “Believe” last month. “Believe” debuted at the No. 1 spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 music chart and recorded record sales of around 374,000 copies in its first week, giving the artist yet another certified platinum album. 
In his short career, Bieber has racked up more than 80 music awards, including 10 Billboard music awards and seven American Music Awards, as well as more than 160 nominations. This year, he was named by Forbes magazine as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world.
