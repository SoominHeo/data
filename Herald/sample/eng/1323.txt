Muslims celebrate Islam’s holy month of Ramadan
As this year’s Ramadan, Islam’s holy month, began on July 10, Muslims around the world have started a month of fasting. 
Muslims in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey and Egypt are observing Ramadan in their own ways. In Seoul, people observed Ramadan prayers at Seoul Central Masjid, Korea’s first mosque, which was established in 1976.
Ramadan, which falls on the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a sacred and holy celebration. It is marked by fasting during the day, abstaining from smoking or drinking, spending time for cleansing the soul and strengthening spirituality. 
During Ramadan, people increase the number of times they pray to five times a day, and recite the Quran, the Muslim holy book, more often. Fasting, which is one of the five obligations stipulated in the Quran, along with prayer, charity, pilgrimage and confession of faith, is mandatory during the 29–30 day ritual, except for those who are ill, travelling, pregnant or diabetic. Even while fasting, people are allowed to eat before sunrise and after sunset.
The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramida or ar-ramad, which means scorching heat or dryness. The celebration was initiated after Muhammad, founder of the religion, received revelations in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. In the United Arab Emirates, Muslims fast for 15 hours each day. In Oman, the country’s labor law states that it is illegal to work more than six hours a day during Ramadan.
The end of Ramadan is celebrated with a bustling festival called Eid al-Fitr, which can be translated as “festival of breaking of the fast.” Muslims share gifts and food with one another during Eid al-Fitr. 
There are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims around the world, making Islam the second-largest world religion after Christianity.
