Stagnation-free kids business
Whether it be one’s life, national economy or consumer preference, there are always ups and downs – either through virtuous or vicious circles. But there is one area in Korea that does not seem likely to see any slump or depression - businesses related to kids.
Those businesses which are booming include medical, theater, cafe and outfit businesses for kids and many more.
Considering that Korea has one of the lowest birth rates among OECD members, the success of the child-related business in the country can be considered as strange.
But thinking twice the lower birth rate can explain the business boom.
Statistics say that the average number of children for a couple as of 2013 was only 1.3, and experts say that the prosperity of these businesses can be explained by parents’ love for such rare children.
Newly coined phrases, such as “VIB” and “Six Pockets” reflect such social trends that treasure children’s well-being.
VIB stands for “Very Important Baby” and “Six Pockets” refers to the parental spending of parents and grandparents for a child. Both explain how sincere and devoted people are in raising a kid.
In the past, Korean kid-related businesses were seen only in the fields of books, toys and clothes, but they have now expanded to include oriental medicine, theaters, cafes and even banking (i.e. kids’ funds).
Experts say social spending on kids has increased because of the country‘s overall economic development and the increasing number of elderly people who are willing to give pocket money to their grandsons and granddaughters.
The experts also explain that kids business is a great example of penetrating into a niche market and that a change of thought can bring an unexpected success that sees no precedents.
