Experience the world without light and sound
What would it be like if there were no light or sound? A science exhibit that provides answers to this question and an in-depth view on the idea is open through Aug. 25, in the Gallery Mac and Play Mac exhibition halls at Mapo Art Center in Seoul.
A kids’ science exhibition titled “Science Explorers in Search of Light and Sound” delves into ideas that originate from children’s curiosity and imagination.
“What would happen if there were no light or sound?” children often ask. The exhibit proposes that in a world of darkness where there is no distinction between day and night, all the plants that survive through photosynthesis from sunlight will become extinct and the sounds of nature and music would disappear.
By seeing, listening, touching and experiencing numerous programs, visitors can build interest and confidence in science. 
Programs at the exhibit include:
1. Light and sound tunnel
Experience a world without light in a space-like spot where there is only a slight hint of light.
2. Laser security room 
Go through a room fortified with a laser security system. 
3. Hologram booth 
See hologram art pieces and learn about the principles of holograms.
4. Sound resonance pipeline 
Create sounds by blowing or hitting pipes. The sound creates vibrations in the air inside the pipe and is transported to the opposite end. People on the other end of the pipe can clearly hear the sound. Different lengths of pipelines create different musical notes and you can play music using that principle.
5. Sound-responding LEDs 
When you make sound, the delicate sound-responding LEDs create a unique sound.
The entire program lasts about 80 minutes. Admission is 20,000 won.
