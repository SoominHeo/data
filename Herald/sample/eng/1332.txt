The 10th Pohang International Fireworks Festival: A midsummer night’s story of lights
Most people only think of daytime activities when planning their summer holidays. With the warmth of the sun, people often forget that summer nights are also full of possibilities. 
In fact, no other season has people eagerly waiting for the sun to set as summer does. With the dusk comes cooler temperatures and exciting nighttime fun. This year, in celebration of midsummer nights, why not consider the excitement to be had at the Pohang International Fireworks Festival. 
Starting on July 26, the nighttime sky above the Hyeongsangang Sports Park and Yeongildae (Bukbu) Beach will light up with color for 10 days as the annual Pohang International Fireworks Festival kicks off under the slogan, “A Midsummer Night’s Story of Lights.”　
The internationally recognized festival’s diverse program will interest visitors of all ages and backgrounds. From various fireworks shows and street performances to all sorts of competitions and experience events, visitors will have plenty of opportunity for fun. With the theme changing day by day and programs planned accordingly, it is no wonder that the Pohang International Fireworks Festival has been included in CNN’s list of the best fireworks displays in the world.
