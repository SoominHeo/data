Korea lays out measures to promote tourism
Korea has a huge potential to develop further if it takes full advantage of its tourism industry. Recently, the government announced measures to attract more tourists to the country and develop the tourism industry as its growth engine, Yonhap News reported on July 17.
 Starting next year, the government will temporarily reimburse the 10 percent value-added tax that foreign tourists pay on their hotels that are recognized by the Korea Hotel Association or the Korea Tourism Association. 
 The number of Chinese language tour guides will increase and for the first time, foreigner-exclusive casinos in locally owned cruise ships will be allowed. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) said it will also ease visa rules for China and Southeastern Asian nations and with a mission of cracking down on irregularities and price rip-off practices, tourist police force will be created. “We have to address inconveniences from the perspective of tourists and push forward tourism as the core of the service industry,” Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong said.
 “The devil is in the details,” Park Guen-hye said at a tourism promotion meeting on July 17. “If visitors are displeased by unfriendliness or exorbitant prices they will never return, regardless of the quality of tourist resources.”
 Korea earned $14.2 billion in tourism revenue last year by attracting around 11 million foreigners to the country. 
 This new measures expect to raise an estimated $24 billion by 2017 by bringing in some 16 million foreign visitors. The number of tourism-related jobs is also expected to rise to 1 million from the current 850,000. Canada adopted a similar tax refund scheme from 1992 to 2006 and enjoyed an average of 5.8 percent rise in tourist revenues annually, according to the MCST. 
 “By faithfully and effectively carrying out the tasks reported today, we will make Korea a country that foreign guests want to visit again,” Park commented.
