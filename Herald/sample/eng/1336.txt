Digital book market continues to grow
The good fight of e-books seems likely to continue and even outgrow the traditional paper book industry in the near future, according to experts.
 A recent survey showed that the sales of digital books in Korea in 2012 were three times larger than the previous year, and in the U.S. sales of e-books have been greater than paper books since 2011.
 French scholar Antoine Compagnon once said to local people in Korea that he was concerned about younger generations who did not have the chance to read hard-copy books without constantly having to worry about their Facebook messages on their tablet gadgets and smartphones.
 But tablet gadgets are not always bad if they can be a tool for people to continue with their reading. The growth of smart gadgets, including smartphones and iPads, have been shown to speed up the growth of digital books as well.
 Also, almost all types of computer operating systems, such as iOS, Android and Windows, are said to support reading applications. Furthermore, e-books are cheaper than paper books once reduced production and distribution costs are taken into consideration, experts say.
 A June report released by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a U.K. services firm, said that the e-book market would grow to $8.2 billion by 2017, and that the paper book market halve by the same year. It went on to predict that e-booksâ€™ share of the global book market would grow from the current 16 percent to 38 percent by 2017.
