Mosquitoes’ favorite blood type is …
One unsavory thing in summer is the coming of mosquitoes. And when it comes to mosquito bites, there are people who are more vulnerable than others, according to a Hankooki.com report on July 17.
 Mosquito bites are not just annoying, they are closely related to medical problems such as malaria as mosquitoes can carry diseases and give them to the people they bite.
 Knowing which traits entice these six-legged bugs will sure help prepare for their vicious and itchy attacks.
 According to news reports, mosquitoes are most attracted to people with blood type O.
 They also like people with a large amount of carbon dioxide in their breath, pregnant people, those with high body temperatures and alcohol drinkers.
 People with different blood types release different chemicals -- a person with blood type A, for example, creates different odors from someone with type B blood. And a study by Dr. Yoshikazu Shirai, Japanese doctor in medical entomology, showed that people with blood type O are most vulnerable to mosquitoes.
 The test was carried out in a controlled room with temperature of 23 degrees. The results showed that people with Type O blood suffered more mosquito bites than others with different blood types.
 Mosquitoes also prefer pregnant women. Pregnant women are on average 1.26 degrees warmer around their belly than non-pregnant women due to the temperature of the amniotic fluid in their stomach. Drinking alcohol also increases one’s body temperature so it attracts more mosquitoes, the study said.　
 Also people who are overweight, wear dark colored clothes and who are less defensive to their attacks are more likely to become their main targets.
 So, people with type O blood, who are pregnant or a bit overweigh and like to drink alcohol or often wear dark clothes, they need to use an efficient mosquito repellant this summer to keep the bugs at bay.
