Is blogging beneficial?
Pro – We are currently living in the digital era, and if we don’t keep up with changes in technology we will be left far behind others. Blogging is the same. What is the reason we do not benefit from the tool when we easily can? Here are some thoughts why I consider blogging beneficial.
 First, blogging connects a user with people from every corner of the world. Numerous cases have shown that Internet tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, are instrumental in spreading key information to people around the world.
 Second, people can learn new languages through blogs. There is even a blog that is solely dedicated to enhancing one’s command of foreign languages, such as “lang-8.com.”
 Third, as mentioned before, we can open ourselves to newer technologies while mingling with all those techy people, even international ones.
 Personally, I don’t see why there are people who are opposed to blogging.

 Con – We can’t deny that blogging does good to society in many aspects, but as a person who had a nightmarish experience, I am not very fond of it.
 First, I received a terrible hacking attack from an unknown user recently, and he or she even went on to delete all the personal data that I had gathered over the past two years. I do not blame the inventor of Facebook, but the attack was carried out through it.
 Second, whether or not people like to be connected with other people all depends on their personality. There are people who do not want to open themselves up on the Internet but keep things to themselves. Frankly speaking, I am one of them.
 Third, from my experience, I found blogging to be a waste of time. I even had a whole week at school dozing off after having chatted with a few people on Twitter.
 So, I do not condemn those who enjoy social blogging, but I do not consider it my all-time favorite pastime, and this is unlikely to change.
