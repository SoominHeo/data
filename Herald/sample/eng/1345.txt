Park 41st-most followed leader on Twitter
President Park Geun-hye (@GH_PARK) is the 41st-most followed world leader on Twitter.
 According to “Twiplomacy,” a study of world leaders on Twitter, released by Burson-Marsteller, a U.S.-based public relations firm, on July 25, U.S. President Barack Obama (@BarackObama) was the most followed world leader on Twitter with more than 33.5 million followers as of July 1.
 President Park was 41st with 327,999 followers. But as of July 25, her number of followers had risen to 334,787. 
Pope Francis was the second-most followed world leader with more than 7.2 million followers on his nine different @Pontifex accounts. 
The White House (@whitehouse) was in third position with 4.01 million followers.
 In terms of direct private interactions between world leaders, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt (@carbildt) was the best connected, mutually following 44 peers. 
The Korean presidential office (@bluehousekorea) was 19th-best connected with 14 mutual peers. 
The U.S. president and the U.S. government accounts might be among the most followed but they were the least connected. @BarackObama, the @WhiteHouse and the @StateDept were followed by 148, 132 and 99 peers respectively.
 However, they only followed four world leaders. They were Russia’s Prime Minister @MedvedevRussiae, the U.K. government @Number10gov, Norway’s Prime Minister @JensStoltenberg and Chile’s President @SebastianPinera. 
The State Department @StateDept did not follow any other foreign service. 
The study found that more than three-quarters, or 77.7 percent, of world leaders have a Twitter account. 
Twiplomacy is a research project aimed at identifying to what extent world leaders use Twitter. Early in July, Burson-Marsteller analyzed 505 Twitter accounts of presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers or their respective governments in 153 countries.
