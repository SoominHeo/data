World Bank gives record aid amid slow economic recovery
The World Bank delivered record aid to poor countries last year amid a difficult global economy, the organization said in a statement on July 23.
 The interest-free loans and grants that the organization provided for the world’s poorest countries reached $16.3 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, which was an all-time high and an 11 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the statement.
 About half of the aid was given to Africa, and 25 percent went to South Asia, the statement said.
 Jim Yong Kim, the head of World Bank, said his organization was right on track to fight poverty in poor countries.
 “The Bank’s performance has been strong during my first year as president, and we are well positioned to address the economic challenges developing countries face during these still uncertain times,” he said in the statement.
 About 20 percent of the world’s population lives in deep poverty, according to AFP, and the World Bank’s goal is to decrease that percentage to three percent.
 AFP said the World Bank had supported about 1,956 operations last year to give needed services to the poor, such as investing in nutrition and building infrastructure.
