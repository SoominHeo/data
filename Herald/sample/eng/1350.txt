Galaxy S4 LTE-A leads global market
Samsung Electronics’ new Galaxy S4, which uses Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) technology, has reinforced its lead in the market.
 The recent release of the Galaxy S4 LTE-A reflects the world’s largest mobile phone maker’s position at the forefront of the smartphone market, and particularly in LTE models.
 Samsung unveiled the Craft, the world’s first LTE mobile phone, and Indulge, the world’s first LTE smartphone, in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
 “The introduction of the Galaxy S4 LTE-A demonstrates Samsung’s desire and ability to provide consumers with technological innovations that take advantage of increased network speeds to deliver richer and fuller experiences,” said Shin Jong-kyun, CEO and president of Samsung’s IT and mobile communications division.
 According to SK Telecom, through which Samsung released the new Galaxy model, the number of subscriptions for the LTE-A service has surpassed 150,000 in just two weeks since launching the service on June 26.
 The figure accounted for almost 30 percent of the telecom carrier’s new subscribers and customers replacing their smartphones.
 The LTE-A model provides an Internet connection with a maximum speed of up to 150 Mbps, which theoretically allows users to download an 800-megabyte movie in 43 seconds.
 Despite the improved Internet speed, there is no extra fee charged -- a main attraction to customers, according to the telecom firm.
 “Samsung will continue to maintain its leadership in the smartphone market by introducing a wide array of models that meet the needs of customers,” Shin said.
