Angelina Jolie, wealthiest actress in Hollywood
The 38 year-old Oscar-winning actress and philanthropist actress Angelina Jolie sure knows how to create a buzz. 
 Jolie topped Forbes’ highest-paid actress list this year, with robust earnings of $33 million from June 2012 to June 2013. 
 U.S. finance magazine Forbes released the list of richest actresses in Hollywood on July 29.
 Though not having appeared in films lately -- her most recent movie appearance was in “The Tourist,” almost three years ago -- Jolie led the highest paying actress group. She spent the past few years writing and directing movies, such as “In the Land of Blood and Honey” and “Unbroken.” She pocketed some $15 million with her role in “Maleficent,” upcoming Disney film set to be released in 2014. She also grabbed $10 million from her advertisement deal with the global fashion brand Louis Vuitton. 
 Jolie went through serious health issues recently. In May, Jolie shocked the world by telling everyone that she had taken a preventive double mastectomy because she was carrying a gene that gives her an 87 percent likelihood of developing breast cancer. The actress’ mother and aunt died from breast cancer. Her essay in the May 14 edition of The New York Times titled “My Medical Choice” created controversy and inspiration all at the same time.
 Other top Hollywood actresses that made the list include another young Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, 22, with $26 million. Kristen Stewart, who earned the most in 2012 with the “Twilight” franchise, came in third place with $22 million. Her flick, “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2” raked in more than $800 million worldwide. A new face on the list, the heroine from “Ted” and “Oz: The Great and Powerful,” Mila Kunis earned $11 million this year. Two Roberts women - Emma Roberts and her aunt Julia Roberts – pocketed $16 million and $11 million, respectively.
