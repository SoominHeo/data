All local high schools to be free by 2017
The Korean government announced on July 30 that all local high schools will begin offering free education by the year 2017, a move that supports President Park Geun-hye’s pledge early in her campaign to address education issues plaguing the nation. 
According to the presidential office and the ruling Saenuri Party, the plan to make all schools expense-free will begin with the gradual increase of the number of high schools across the nation providing free education from 2014. The move to provide free high school education was first put into effect at the end of April, when Rep. Kim Hee-jung of the ruling party proposed a bill to revise the Education Law.
 Rural areas will be the first beneficiaries of the new policy, which will then be extended to all high schools by 2017. 
“To alleviate parents’ concerns over high education fees, the party alongside the government and Cheong Wa Dae decided to first offer free education to students living on islands and remote areas,” Rep. Kim said during a briefing. 
“The number of beneficiaries will increase every year by 25 percent to benefit the nation’s high school students by 2017.”
 The policy was agreed upon during a three-party meeting to discuss educational issues involving officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the Ministry of Education and ruling Saenuri Party. 
If implemented, the new policy would help guarantee that all children aged 3 to 17 will receive free child care and education by the end of Park’s administration. 
The proposed bill, however, is expected to face some resistance due to the growing concern over the budget needed to implement the new policy. The Ministry of Education called for a budget increase, saying it anticipates that approximately nine trillion won would be needed to implement the free education policy.
