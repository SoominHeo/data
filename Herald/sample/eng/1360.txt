Digital cameras edged out
A decade ago, people became fascinated by the advent of a new camera that was much smaller and made it far easier to print and store the photos taken. Now, the fad of digital camera is already over and cannot fight newer technologies represented by smartphones and social networking services.
 The Wall Street Journal, a U.S. business daily, elaborated in its recent article on the dying popularity of digital camera and argued that it was too late for digital cameras to be revived with high-end technologies.
 In the July article entitled “Point-and-Shoot Camera’s Existential Moment,” the business newspaper said that digital cameras remained “stand-alone” while adding Internet connectivity through Wi-Fi was commonplace in consumer electronics.
 The article explained that only 1 in 6 digital cameras shipped in 2013 would be equipped with Wi-Fi, quoting a research firm.
 As to another reason why digital camera is fading, the newspaper pointed to the convenience and photo-sharing that social networking sites, such as Facebook and Instagram, provide.
 “Everyone in this industry recognizes the market is changing,” said Hiroshi Tanaka, corporate vice president at Fujifilm to The Wall Street Journal in an interview. “The question is what we can do about it.”
 The newspaper said that such an industrial change was forcing Japanese camera producers, including Fujifilm and Panasonic, to pare product lines and adapt offerings.
 Meanwhile, the newspaper warned that the Japanese camera makers’ efforts might not prove fruitful, saying that digital camera producers are pushing pricey models such as ones with more than 10-times optical zoom but that product prices could plunge following such competition.
 The global digital camera market may shrink to 102 million units in 2013, compared with a peak of about 144 million in 2010, the newspaper added, quoting experts.
