Volcanic eruption in Japan
Another natural disaster swept a city of Japan. A volcano has erupted in south-western Japan, blanketing the area with a dim layer of ash, AP reported on Aug. 19. 
 It was Mount Sakurajima’s 500th eruption this year, located in Kagoshima city in Japan‘s southern island of Kyushu. The 1,117-meter mountain belched out a mushroom-shaped plume up to 5,000 meters into the air. 
 A large amount of volcanic ash that fell in the city caused transport delays. The city’s railway operation was temporarily halted to clear ash from the track and garbage trucks and water sprinklers were sent to clean up the road.
 Local media described driving after the volcanic eruption as being as murky as driving through snow at night. Poor visibility forced drivers to turn on their headlights. Residents of Kagoshima city wore masks and raincoats and carried umbrellas to protect themselves from the ash. 
 Sakurajima erupts often, but this was the highest plume since the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started keeping records in 2006, the Japan Meteorological Agency noted. Lava flowed about one kilometer from the fissure with some volcanic rocks rolling down the mountainside.
 “The smoke was a bit dramatic, but we are kind of used to it,” said a city official. Though the eruption was more massive than usual, residents were fairly used to it. No injuries or damage were reported from the incident and according to JMA there are no signs of a larger eruption at Sakurajima though similar activities may repeat.
 Japan is situated on the “Ring of Fire,” the seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, which makes it that much more vulnerable to frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity, the report added.
