Hyundai Capital pursues trustworthy commercial transaction
Many consumer products, such as home appliances, smartphones, furniture and even cars are traded online these days for those who are looking for cheaper secondhand goods at reasonable prices.
 But not all of those online transactions are trustworthy, and they often lead to rip-off and falsified product records.
 To fight such irrationality and boost trust in online trading, Hyundai Capital, a local auto financing company, is gearing up its efforts through “trustworthy online transaction.”
 Hyundai Capital said it operates the “Auto Inside” website, where secondhand car purchasers can get detailed information about used cars listed online -- in particular their records of involvement in accidents or floods.
 “When consumers use a car that looks trouble-free but was once flooded, they risk being in accidents as the auto parts are highly likely corrode more rapidly than average secondhand vehicles,” a Hyundai official explained.
 “Also, the consumers will suffer mentally from deceitful trading, so they need to pay particular attention when they buy used cars.”
 The official said such irregularities will not happen if consumers buy cars through “Auto Inside” portal website; they are given a free online coupon before their purchase and asked to punch in their car registration number, the official explained.
 Consumers will be provided with more data about the car they want to buy from the Korea Insurance Development Institute, which has a business partnership with Hyundai Capital.
 Hyundai Capital said it would continue to come up with new services that can build the trust and confidence of customers and clients.
