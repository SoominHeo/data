Lydia Ko wins LPGA Tour
Sixteen-year-old Lydia Ko defended an LPGA Tour title for a second time as she won the CN Canadian Women‘s Open on Aug. 25.
 The South Korean born New Zealander beat Karine Icher of France at Royal Mayfair Golf Club in Alberta, Canada.
 Having been born in Seoul, Ko headed to New Zealand at age 6 with her family.
 At age 15, she became the youngest winner of an LPGA Tour event at the CN Canadian Women’s Open.
 After the game on Aug. 25, Ko said that she felt so great because she could play a lot better than she had expected.
 She said: “My goal was to shoot 5-under and just play my game. If somebody else shot better, I couldn’t do anything about it.”
 Asked whether she thinks she has become part of sports history as a young player, she answered she was not sure where “history” starts.
 “There are so many big names among those (who made history), so it’s such an honor,” she said.
 The youngest winner in LPGA Tour history was also once named sports ambassador for the 2012 Korea-New Zealand year of friendship last year.
 New Zealand Ambassador to Korea Patrick Rata presented an award and certificate to the teenage golfing sensation in September 2012, designating her as a sports envoy.
 Rata said Ko was a perfect fit for the role, adding that all New Zealanders were proud of her victories at the Canadian Women’s Open and U.S. Women’s Amateur event.
