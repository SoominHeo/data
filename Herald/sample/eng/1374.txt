Ashton Kutcher’s ‘Jobs’ digs deep into personal side of Apple creator
Watching the newly released film “Jobs” might be as “cool” as owning a product from the company this movie portrays: Apple. 
The film about the deceased tech genius Steve Jobs hit local theaters on Aug. 29. Actor Ashton Kutcher played the main character, mimicking the former Apple CEO’s trademark look, talk and walk, sending viewers gasping in amazement. 
The film’s last scene is surprisingly not Jobs’ funeral, but his return to Apple after being kicked out as the company’s CEO due to struggles with the company board. He was brought in to save the sinking Apple. 
In the film, Jobs, a college drop-out, sets up a company at his parent’s garage with his friend, Steve Wozniak. He is an extraordinary entrepreneur and succeeds to attract a crucial investor from the industry. With this, he is able to trail blaze in the era of personal computing.
 Sometimes, his frenetic attention to perfection puts his relations with others in jeopardy, but in the end this made Apple different from numerous other companies and created products that throngs of consumers crave. 
Today, owning Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, iPod, entails a show-off element. Apple products are “cool,” according to Jobs, and people who own them automatically become cool. This is the image that Steve Jobs conjured up with his company. 
The film teaches people about how important it is to keep trying after failure. And to reach the top, you have to put in that much more effort and passion into it. 
As Steve Jobs frequently stated, people came to the Earth to lay some trace of their lives. Even if he is gone now, there is no doubt that he left colossal footsteps to the development of the mankind while he was on Earth; therefore he accomplished his goal.
