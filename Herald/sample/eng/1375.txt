Versatile actor Joo Won
Joo Won, an already well-known musical actor, is receiving renewed attention with his role as an autistic doctor in KBS drama, “Good Doctor.”

 Joo Won‘s acting as an autistic patient is receiving rave reviews from viewers and experts alike.
 The Herald Business said in a recent article that Joo Won’s performance is outstanding in that it is neither exaggerated nor plain.

 Joo started out as a member of “Frees,” a singing and dancing group in 2006.
