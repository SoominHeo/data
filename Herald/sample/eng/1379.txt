New mammal species discovered in more than three decades
American scientists have discovered an unknown animal species in forests of Colombia and Ecuador. 
 Freshly named olinguito, the new carnivore is the first to be identified in the Western hemisphere in 35 years.
 The rare discovery was made by a team of scientists in the Smithsonian Institution. Dr. Kristofer Helgen uncovered bones and skins of the animal in storage at a museum in Chicago. “When I looked at the skulls I didn’t recognize the anatomy … and I thought it could be a species new to science,” said Helgen who is curator of mammals at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., which houses the largest mammal collection in the world.
