Acquitted, four years later
The story of American student Amanda Knox began four years ago when she was charged with the murder of her British housemate, Meredith Kercher. The two women were living together in Perugia, Italy, when Kercher’s body was found on Nov. 2 2007 by the police. 
Knox and her Italian boyfriend at the time, Raffaele Sollecito, were accused and charged with Kercher’s murder, along with local resident, Rudy Guede. News of Kercher’s murder and Knox’s subsequent arrest gained international attention as people began questioning the competency of the Italian police as well the media’s portrayal of Knox throughout the trial. 
Knox and Sollecito have always maintained their innocence. On Oct. 3, four years since their arrest, Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of murder and sexual assault by a Perugia appeals court due to the lack of and contamination of DNA evidence gathered at the scene.
