War in Syria creates over 1 million child refugees
The number of child refugees created by the Syrian war has reached more than a million, according to the United Nations on Aug. 27.
 The U.N. notes that about half of these children are forced to flee the war in Syria to refugee camps in neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, North Africa and Europe.
 Three out of four of them are under 11 years old and around 80 percent of them cannot go to school, the U.N. added.ã€€
 The conflict in Syria began in March 2011 and since then more than 1.7 million people have registered as refugees.
