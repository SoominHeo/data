Lee Hyori officially ties the knot
K-pop diva Lee Hyori is now officially off the market as she and longtime boyfriend, jazz guitarist Lee Sang-soon, tied the knot on Sept. 1.
 The wedding was held at their country home on the northern part of Jeju Island and was reported to have been a simple and private affair with only family and close friends in attendance. 
Although there had been rumors circulating about a September wedding, the two had made no official public announcements on the exact date they planned to hold the event. The couple previously stated that both of them mutually decided against holding a wedding ceremony, opting for a quiet, informal dinner in lieu of any big, formal public event. ã€€
 Hyori, 34, and Sang-soon, 39, have been together since 2011 and first announced their engagement in July.
