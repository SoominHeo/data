World‘s factories move to India from China
Bloomberg Businessweek, a U.S. economic weekly, pointed to the possibility of India replacing China as “the world’s manufacturing hub.”
 For the reason that China is losing its appeal as the global manufacturing center, the weekly explained: “Chinese wages are going up and the labor market (there) is getting tighter.”
 Manufacturing is often compared to high-tech businesses as the former has long been led dominantly by China, whereas the development of the latter has been led by advanced countries and other emerging leaders, such as Korea and India.
 And now such global manufacturing facilities are likely to move to India, as its government pushes its unprecedented move to attract foreign business, according to the weekly magazine.
 The weekly said that the Indian government was planning to build an “industrial corridor” between the two major cities of Delhi and Mumbai.
 Bloomberg went on to introduce the Indian government‘s plan to build seven new industrial cities operated jointly with the Japanese government. The seven cities are expected to be equipped with “China-style” standards.
 India is also channeling its efforts to make its manufacturing businesses more attractive with the plan so-called “National Manufacturing Policy.”
 According to the policy mapped out in 2012, the local government plans to drive up the growth of its manufacturing sector by 12 to 14 percent over 15 years, create 100 million jobs in the field by 2025, and nurture relative talents among “rural migrants” and “urban poor.”
 Grain of knowledge
 Smokestack industry
 Manufacturing businesses are commonly categorized as the smokestack industries (loosely translated into Korean as “굴뚝산업”). Factories used in these industries are installed with gigantic chimneys that often emit a great amount of pollution.
