Juice cleansing trend arrives in Korea
Since global Pop queen Beyonce revealed her secret to losing nine kilograms in the span of just two weeks as the liquid lemon detox diet -- consisting of glasses of fresh water, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and natural maple syrup -- in 2007, the interest on the new juice cleansing diet has exploded. 　
 Numerous people around the world have paid keen attention to juice cleansing detox diets, which they believe help rid the body of hard-to-digest foods and unwanted toxins, while losing weight and refreshing one’s mind along the way.
 In line with the global trend, raw food chef Christine Cho and pastry chef Kim Yong-hui have teamed up with Herald Ecofarm, a sister company of The Korea Herald, to create Korea’s first detox juice line, “Just Juice Cleanse.” 
 Though many celebrities have promoted juice detox as a method of an instant weight loss the two chefs caution that consuming only liquids as a method of dieting can be quite dangerous. 
 “Although you will lose weight in the process, the detox program is not intended as a quick-fix diet, but as a means of promoting a healthier lifestyle,” said Kim. 
 “People use these (detox programs) for a quick-fix diet, but that can be very harmful,” Cho also stated.
 The Just Juice Cleanse proposes to renew one’s overall health by providing a healthy dose of nutrients and minerals and dispensing unwanted toxins and pollutants accumulated in the inner organs. 
 According to the Global Healing Center, people are on average exposed to thousands of toxins every day and ingest more than twice the amount of pollutants that the body can naturally expel.
