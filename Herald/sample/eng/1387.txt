Choo hits 100th major league homer, joins 100-100 club
One of Korea’s most celebrated baseball players, Choo Shin-soo finally did it! Choo Shin-soo of the Cincinnati Reds smashed his 100th career Major League Baseball (MLB) home run against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium on Aug. 28, Yonhap News reported. 
 The milestone home run came off against St. Louis Cardinals starter Joe Kelly in the fifth inning. It was Choo’s 17th homerun for the season and 100th home run during his nine-year stint in Major League Baseball. Choo’s was a solo homer at the game where the Reds lost to the Cards 6-1. MLB.com lists 40 active players with at least 100 home runs and 100 steals in their careers. Choo is the second Asian player after Japan’s Ichiro Suzuki to be listed on the 100-100 club (100 homers and 100 steals) in the major leagues. 
 The 31-year-old slugger entered MLB in 2005 with the Seattle Mariners; he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 2006. He played for the Cleveland Indians from 2006 to 2012. He took charge of the right field for the Indians and became the everyday center fielder for the Reds after joining the NL club during a trade-off last December.
 This is his first season with the Cincinnati Reds and already he has become one of the most valuable outfielders in the National League, the report stated. He is also on his smooth way to post his third career “20-20” season, with at least 20 home runs and 20 steals. Choo will become a free agent after this season and reach a lucrative, multi-year contract from a team that desires him; he is currently making $7.37 million a season. Choo has hit 100 home runs and 101 steals in 826 games.
