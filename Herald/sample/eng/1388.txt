Korean rap wars
The local hip-hop scene has been explosive in late August as several rap stars decided to carry out their feuds publicly, and with some pretty harsh verses. 
It all started when American rapper Kendrick Lamar released the hip-hop track “Control.” The piece called out a handful of the new rappers in the U.S. music industry, such as Wale, Pusha T, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky and Drake, and told them all to step aside.
 A similar scene was played out in Seoul. Korean rapper Swings chose to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. rapper and started an all-out war when he released his version of “Control” titled “King Swings” and “Hwang Jung-min (King Swings Part 2).” Swings specifically called out fellow hip-hop artists Ugly Duck, E-Sens and Simon D. 
In the last week of August, Swings released a follow-up titled “Shinsegae (King Swings Part 3),” continuing his attacks.
 Countering Swings’ attack, E-Sens, jumped on the bandwagon by releasing his first single, “You Can’t Control Me.“ The song lashed out at his former management company Amoebaculture and specifically targeted former label mate Gaeko of Dynamic Duo.
 This inevitably led to a diss-track domino effect with Gaeko responding to E-Sens‘ challenge by releasing his response track titled, “I Can Control You.” 
E-Sens’ former partner in crime Simon D, who was his teammate in the now defunct hip-hop act “Supreme Team,” also decided to join the brawl and released his version of “Control,” returning the attacks originally made by Swings. Along with the four key players in this ongoing hip-hop turf war, many other local rappers have also gone head-to-head by releasing a string of blatant attack tracks.
