YG Entertainment to debut new boy band via survival contest
One of Korea’s most prominent entertainment companies, YG Entertainment has announced that it will launch a survival TV show in search of finding the next “Big Bang,” according to the Korea Herald on Aug. 21.
 YG Entertainment CEO Yang Hyun-suk said in a blog post that he will debut a new boy band through a TV show and has been grooming two groups of male trainees for the upcoming program.
 The name of the new show is “WIN,” an acronym for the company’s promotional slogan “Who Is Next,” according to the report. 
 “It was impossible to debut two boy bands simultaneously, so the two groups of trainees will compete against one another in YG Entertainment’s new survival program ‘WIN,’” the company CEO said. “The winning group will debut after the show under the group name ‘WINNER,’ and become YG Entertainment’s first new boy band since Big Bang. “However,” he said, “the losing group may be disbanded or have its members replaced.” 
 About the concern that the show might make him and his company look cruel to others -- devastating the losing team members and their fans -- Yang stated that this is a candid reflection of the harsh realities in the showbiz industry. Yet Yang added that how the things will turn out remains undecided. 
 The contest will be entirely depend on audience voting and broadcast in various languages including English, Chinese and Japanese via various media channels, which means that international audiences can also influence the show’s final result.
