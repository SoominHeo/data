Crayon Pop buzz
At the center of the nation’s latest girl group craze is “Crayon Pop,” a novice K-pop group that has grabbed fervid attention from overseas broadcasters, the Korea Herald reported on Aug. 23. 
 Reporters from the U.S.’ ABC News and China’s Shanghai TV visited Korea on Aug. 22 to interview the five-member girl group Crayon Pop. 
 “International broadcasting corporations will follow Crayon Pop for a day,” a representative of the rookie group’s agency Chrome Entertainment said. 
“They hope to feature Crayon Pop in their shows. We feel grateful, happy and surprised all at the same time.” 
 The group’s single “Bar Bar Bar” has become the next sensation on YouTube after Psy’s “Gangnam Style” with its quirky choreography and unique stage customs which entails colorful motorcycle helmets. Five members -- Ellin, So Yul, Gum Mi, Cho-a and Way -- jump up and down and side to side to “Bar Bar Bar,” carrying out the so-called the “Five-Piston Engine Dance.” The growing popularity of the “Bar Bar Bar” music video has created countless replicas on the web. 
 The group initially released the single in June this year, but it didn’t become popular until a parody music video of “Bar Bar Bar” was aired on SNL Korea early last month. Since then the song has risen on the top of the Billboard K-pop Hot 100 chart. As of Sept. 1, its famous music video has been viewed more than 4.2 million times. 
 Now a household name in Korean showbiz, they have become the sole Korean K-pop group to be invited to perform at the 23rd Qingdao International Beer Festival in China.
