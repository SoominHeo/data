Auto camping in the fall
Rapid industrial development is bringing changes to people's pastime activities, and one of the most recent is the increase in auto camping.
 Travelers used to carry everything in their backpacks to enjoy their precious weekends.
 But with the increase in the number of camper vans, tourists can reach their destinations quickly and use their cars for the night without worrying about accommodation.
 Before the era of auto camping, people had to make their luggage as compact as possible, but now owner-drivers can bring barbecue grills, tents, coolers, fishing chairs, stoves and more.
 Auto camping has long been enjoyed overseas in countries such as Germany, Austria, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.
 But Korea is also witnessing an increasing number of auto camping sites, cars and relevant equipment. A recent statistic showed that the number of auto campers in Korea topped 1.3 million and there are over 1,000 auto camping sites in the country.
 As to why auto camping in Korea is becoming popular, experts point to the growing number of outbound tourists who enjoy the new camping scene and the increasing number of online auto camping communities. The countryâ€™s economic development also played its part, they said.
 Although auto camping is more popular in summer than fall, there are still many camping sites highly recommended by enthusiasts for the brisk weather.
 Check out these three places where you can enjoy the autumn breeze as recommended by The Korea Herald.
