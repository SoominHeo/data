Seoul to expand mobile device services for tech-savvy citizens
Starting next year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will begin to implement several new services, including free cellphone charger rentals, in the hopes of improving the quality of citizens’ experience of using their mobile devices. 
By 2015, the Seoul government hopes to drastically increase the number of Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas to 10,000 or more, as well as provide a variety of mobile services that would be helpful in daily life. 
One notable service is the “intelligent matchmaking service between citizens and taxis,” set to be introduced in 2014. This service is expected to help both passengers and drivers by easing the burden of trying to find a taxi as well as lowering the number of empty taxis on the street. 
Passengers who download the forthcoming taxi information app will be able to get information on taxis available nearby as well as places where a lot of vacant taxis are waiting, while drivers will be able to get information on where there are many customers at any given time. 
Another planned service is the free rental of cellphone chargers from government offices and subway stations. The rental service will be provided at government offices and subway stations city-wide to help ensure cellphone users have enough battery throughout the day. 
The free charger rental service was first offered on a trial basis during public events and the decision to expand the service was made due to the public’s overwhelmingly positive response.
