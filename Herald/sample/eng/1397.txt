Samsung launches Galaxy Gear smart watch
Samsung has nudged ahead of Apple by unveiling its new smart watch on Sept.4.
 Samsung unveiled its latest tech gadget, the Galaxy Gear smart watch, loaded with a 1.6-inch (4 cm) LED display, a 1.9 mega-pixel camera, a speaker, microphone, 10 different clock options, four gigabytes of internal storage and a non-removable battery. It also offers a range of colorful watch straps. 
 This “smart” watch can make voice calls so it can be an alternative to a Bluetooth headset for making calls, according to Samsung Electronics. It also runs a slew of applications which include Evernote’s note-taking software, auction service eBay, the social network Path and several fitness programs.
 Yet, analysts seem quite disappointed by its reliance on other Samsung products, such as Android smartphones and tablet, instead of operating as a completely autonomous device. The watch working only as an accessory to other Galaxy devices may limit its appeal gravely, BBC stated on Sept. 4. Moreover, it only has a day’s battery life, meaning that users need to charge up the watch every night before going to bed.
 The world’s best-selling smartphone maker has seen its handset sales slow and been under immense pressure to come up with another successful product. 
 “The introduction of the Galaxy smart watch comes as no surprise to the industry, which has been expecting Samsung to beat the likes of Apple - as well as watchmakers and other consumer electronics companies – to market,” one technology analyst noted.
 Whether the Galaxy Gear smart watch will be as successful as the Galaxy phones is not clear, but the sale of the “fashion icon” is scheduled to begin on Sept. 25 at the IFA consumer tech show in Berlin with the price tag of around $300.
 Tech consultancy Canalys forecasts as many as five million smart watches could be sold in 2014.
