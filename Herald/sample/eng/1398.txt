The 50th Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival
The Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival celebrating the Hwaseong Fortress is once again set to kick off in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. 
Built on the filial piety of the 22nd King of the Joseon Dynasty, King Jeongjo, as well as his dreams of reformation, the Hwaseong Fortress is a must-see attraction throughout the year. Its beauty and significance, however, cannot be fully appreciated until the annual Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival. 
In its 50th year, the festival will kick off on Sept. 27, with the closing ceremony scheduled to be held on Oct. 1, just before the annual Suwon Citizen’s Day celebrations on Oct. 10. 
The festival includes a variety of events and programs that give tourists a chance to appreciate the history and culture of Hwaseong. Not only are there various parades, including the reenactment of the Royal Parade of King Jeongjo the Great, the Hwaseong Food Culture Festival is scheduled to be held in tandem with the Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival, allowing guests to sample traditional dishes as well as performances from around the world. 
Though admission to the festival itself is free, some programs may include separate participation fees. For more information about the festival, visit the festival’s official website at https://shfes.suwon.go.kr.
 Hwaseong Fortress
 Designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 1997, the Hwaseong Fortress was built between 1794 and 1796 by King Jeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty. Located approximately 30km south of Seoul, the walls of the Hwaseong Fortress enclose much of central Suwon, including King Jeongjo’s palace, Haenggung.
