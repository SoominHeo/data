Camp that made my mind flutter
Others might think that the rain ruined their excitement, but the rain made my heart flutter more than the others. My mind was getting nervous it got closer to the time when we would meet each other, and as I got to this camp, I just thought it was right to be excited.
 First of all, I got to learn about teamwork. When we debated with each other, and other team members were talking, it made me think, “If we don’t use teamwork, it will be very hard to communicate the right way with each other like right now!”
 That taught me a very good lesson about using teamwork.
 Second, it gave me a huge lesson about concentrating. At the camp, one of my roommates was playing a game on her phone, so she couldn’t listen what the staff was talking about, and later she couldn’t even finish her workbook! From that experience, I learned that paying attention was very, very important.
 Third, this camp also told me how to write an article. My teacher Mr. Pavesic told the whole class, that today’s journal topic was “Write An Article About You.”
 Well, first I thought it wasn’t a big deal, but as I sat down in my chair, I didn’t know what order to write it in, and also had no idea about how to write it.
 As I spent almost 48 hours in this camp, I discovered a lot of ways to write an article, and I think it was very helpful to me.
 Just saying the good stuff about the Junior Herald camp doesn’t mean it was always perfect. So, there are 2 things that could have been better. First, the staff could have been better about caring about us, and second, they could have explained a little bit more on how to write an article.
