 Storyline
 In protecting her friends from an attack by monsters, Thalia sacrifices herself and her father Zeus turns her into a pine tree. Zeus wants no more demi-gods to suffer what Thalia had to suffer, so the tree creates a magical border around the Half-Blood camp, protecting campers from further attacks. But suddenly the camp is ravaged by a Colchis Bull that manages to break through the border. Percy defeats it with the help of his half-brother Tyson, Annabeth and Clarisse. Yet they realize that Thalia’s tree has been poisoned and became vulnerable to attack. To heal the tree and save the camp from evil, Percy and his demi-god friends go on an adventure to retrieve the Golden Fleece from Polyphemus in the Sea of Monsters. 
 Actress Alexandra Daddario plays Annabeth and Jake Abel stars as Luke in the movie.
