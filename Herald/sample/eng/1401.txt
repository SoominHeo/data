Singer BoA takes on drama world
After her success in K-pop, singer BoA has set her sights on the small-screen, starring in the two-episode KBS drama “Expect to Date,” scheduled to air on Sept. 11 and 12. 
After making a brief cameo appearance in SBS’ “ATHENA: Goddess of War” in 2010, BoA continued to forge a career in television with SBS’ hit music reality show, “K-Pop Star,” where she gained credibility as a compelling judge. 
Having established her position as a television personality through “K-Pop Star,” BoA is attempting to broaden her horizons with her first small-screen lead in “Expect to Date.” 
“The main reason I chose to do this work is because the script was very good,” said BoA at the drama’s press conference in Seoul on Thursday. “Also because it is only two episodes long I felt I could learn a lot without being too much of a burden on the crew and team.” 
In “Expect to Date,” BoA plays Joo Yeon-ae, a romantic who finds herself continually dumped by a string of college boyfriends. Determined to find a keeper, Joo signs up for dating advice from an expert, Cha Gi-dae (played by veteran actor Choi Daniel), via social networking. In the series, Joo finds herself falling for Cha, even though she realizes that Jung Jin-gook (played by ZE:A member Siwan), her somewhat naive and faithful boyfriend, would be a safe and wise choice as a potential husband. 
In regards to dating, BoA herself admitted to being a bit like her heroine when it comes to matters of love.
 “I don’t feel that I have really dated properly yet, but I want to,” BoA confessed. “Truthfully, I am not good at playing the dating game, so I think that dating a pick-up artist like Cha would be a bit too much. I think it would be best to date a less experienced guy.”
