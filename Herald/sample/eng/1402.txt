Panama Canal tour
The Panama Canal is a man-made structure that stretches over about 80 kilometers connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
 France began building the canal in 1881, but it was finished by the United Sates in 1914 due to the former’s poor performance and weak expertise.
 The historic construction made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans in half the time previously needed.
 When the canal opened in 1914, approximately 1,000 ships passed through the structure, and the annual traffic has increased tenfold since then. Nowadays, about 30 ships pass through the canal every day.
 Visitors to the canal usually go through on cruise ships. According to the Cruise Critic website (www.cruisecritic.com), the best time to go on a cruise in Panama is November, when the country’s rainy season ends.
 Most cruise ships take passengers the length of the canal while some others allow them to disembark at towns along the way.
 For tourists who seek comprehensive knowledge about the Panama Canal, there is the Miraflores Visitors Center. Located on the eastern side of the Miraflores locks just outside of Panama City, the center has four exhibition halls touching upon the canal’s history, water, impact on trade and more. The center also has a restaurant that commands great views of the canal, quite a few snack bars and a gift shop.
