Controversial history textbook to be revised
After weeks of controversy, the authors of a history textbook have finally agreed to revise their content, taking the first steps toward finding a middle ground. 
The book in question, authored by conservative historians, was one among eight Korean history textbooks approved for publishing by the National Institute of Korean History, commissioned by the Ministry of Education. 
Scheduled to be used in high schools starting next year, the textbook has come under intense scrutiny since the Ministry of Education decided to make Korean history a mandatory subject in the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) from 2017.
 Accused by liberals of being “ideologically-biased and flawed,” the controversy surrounding the textbook came to head after a group of researchers from the Institute of Korean Historical Studies and other groups of history scholars found nearly 300 factual errors in the text, most of them related to Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. 
“We will fully carry out the Education Ministry’s instructions of revision ... We will also humbly accept the 298 (controversial) points cited by history organizations,” said Lee Myung-hee, a professor at Kongju National University in central South Korea and the book’s main author, during a press conference at the Seoul Press Center on Sept. 17.
 Following accusations that the textbook contains not just factual errors but also glorifies pro-Japanese collaboration and the dictatorships of Korea’s military-led regimes, Education Minister Seo Nam-soo has said that the ministry will have the content revised rather than immediately withdrawing its endorsement of the book as its opponents have called for.
 “The revision will cover not only facts but also historical interpretations, through which we will make a balanced, widely accepted textbook that will help our children develop a correct view of the nation,” the author added.
