Woman of Indian descent wins Miss America
For the first time in the history of Miss America, America’s top beauty queen is a woman of Indian origin, AFP reported on Sept. 17.
 The new Miss America Nina Davuluri is a 24-year-old college student from the state of New York who wants to be a doctor, the report added. 
 “I’m so happy this organization has embraced diversity,” she said after winning the coveted title. “I’m thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new Miss America.”
 At the pageant held in Atlantic City Davuluri performed a traditional Bollywood-style Indian dance, a victory for diversity in America. “It was the first time Bollywood has been performed on the Miss America stage. It’s an honor for myself and my community,” Davuluri told ABC news. 
 “Halfway through, I just started crying because you know, it was such an incredible experience being on that Miss America stage. It was so meaningful and powerful.”
 Most people celebrated Davuluri’s victory but there were some who branded her as an Arab terrorist and threw racial comments. 　
 Davuluri who competed on the platform issue of ‘celebrating diversity through cultural competency’ said that she has to rise above discrimination. “I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.” 
 During her service as Miss America in 2014, she will travel worldwide to meet with audiences as the official national goodwill ambassador for the children’s charity group Children‘s Miracle Network Hospitals.
