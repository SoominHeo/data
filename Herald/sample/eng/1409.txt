Apple introduces new iPhone 5S and 5C smartphones
In a bid to expand its share of the global smartphone market, Apple has unveiled two new devices: the top-end iPhone 5S and a cheaper iPhone 5C.
 It was the first time the global tech giant launched two different types of handset simultaneously. 
 At an event in Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California on Sept. 10, Apple’s chief executive officer Tim Cook claimed that the cheaper iPhone would widen the appeal of the phone in the global market. In particular, the new products will help raise Apple’s profit in China. Apple has seen its market share dwindle over the last year in China where its local brand and Samsung Galaxy smartphone have been playing strong.
 The company hopes the new product can have a bigger sway in world‘s biggest mobile phone market, Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at the consultancy Ovum, noted. “The cheaper iPhone is critical for expanding the addressable market, because many people in China and elsewhere simply can’t afford to buy a current generation [top-end] iPhone, especially when it’s not subsidized.”
 The 5S resembles the iPhone 5, but it has one major innovation in the fingerprint sensor, a security feature that helps identify the user. Apple claims that consumers will feel safer when banking and shopping online with the iPhone 5S.
 The cheaper iPhone 5C comes with a plastic case in a choice of five colors. It has an 8 megapixel camera, an HD FaceTime camera, and the latest wireless networking, including 4G LTE cellular data and Bluetooth 4.0. It’s sold at a starting price of $99 in the U.S. with a two-year contract. 
 Sales for the two devices began on Sept. 20 in the United States, Australia, Britain, China, France, Germany, Japan and Singapore.
