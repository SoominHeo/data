 Citizens of Tuvalu are thirsty
The Pacific island of Tuvalu, the world’s fourth-smallest nation, has declared a state of emergency and has begun rationing its water supply as of Oct. 7. 
Down to its last few days of water, New Zealand and Australia have had to quickly send some supplies, including water-making equipment, to the nation located just below the Equator. According to Reuters, residents in the capital Funafuti have been “rationed to two buckets of fresh water a day.” 
A country with a population of less than 11,000, Tuvalu and the neighboring Tokelau island group has seen less rain than average for the past six months due to severe changes in weather patterns.
