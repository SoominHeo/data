Celebrating traditional medicine
In celebration of the 400th anniversary since the Korean medical text Donguibogam by royal physician Heo Jun was first published, the world’s first traditional medicine expo is being held in the Sancheong County of South Gyeongsang Province from Sept. 6 to Oct. 20.
 World Traditional Medicine Fair Festival
 The World Traditional Medicine Fair Festival is currently being held at Donguibogam Village, named after the traditional Korean medical encyclopedia. Nestled between the two highest peaks of Mount Jirisan, the locale is ideal for rehabilitation and relaxation.
 “Twenty-two hundred years ago, Emperor Qin Shi Huang of China sent an expedition to Mount Jirisan in South Korea’s southeast to find the fabled herb of youth,” Choi Gu-sik, chairman of the expo told Yonhap News. 
 “Since our event will be held at the eastern tip of Mount Jirisan, where the life force is known to be the strongest, I’d like to call it the ‘Healing Expo,’” he said of the World Traditional Medicine Fair Festival.
 What is Donguibogam?
 Listed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Program since July 2009, Donguibogam is a Korean medical text compiled by the royal physician Heo Jun (1539-1615). First published in 1613 during the Joseon Dynasty, the book is considered an important part of the history of Korea’s traditional medicine. It remains a key reference work for the study of Eastern medicine. The text was so revolutionary at the time that it contained insights that did not enter medical knowledge in Europe until the 20th century. 
In 2011, UNESCO designated 2013 as “Donguibogam Year” to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the medical encyclopedia’s publication. 
Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who ruled over China from B.C. 246 to B.C. 221, was famous for his obsession with immortality.
