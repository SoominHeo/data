Wrestling to return as core Olympic sport beginning 2020 Tokyo Games
After losing its spot as a core Olympic sport in February, wrestling has been reinstated for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were awarded to Tokyo by the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Sept. 9. 
 The sport, which has its root in the ancient Olympics in Greece, received 49 votes to easily defeat the competition from baseball-softball, which got 24 votes, and squash, which earned 22 votes. Squash was trying to make the Olympics for the third time while men’s baseball and women’s softball merged into a single game to try to return to the games after being dropped for the 2012 and 2016 Games.
 “Today is the most important day in the 2,000-year history of our sport. We feel the weight of that history. Remaining on the Olympic program is crucial to wrestling’s survival,” FILA president Nenad Lalovic said. 
 The wrestling body FILA carried out a fervent campaign for the past six months to save its Olympic status; revamping its organization mired in bureaucratic inefficiency. “With this vote, you have shown that the steps we have taken to improve our sport have made a difference,” Lalovic stated. “I assure each of you that our modernization will not stop now. We will continue to strive to be the best partner to the Olympic movement that we can be.”
 “We cannot imagine the Games without wrestling,” said Sheik Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, head of the Association of National Olympic Committees, noted. ”Wrestling is a founder. Today was a great result.”
 For the host of 2020 Games, Tokyo impressed the Olympic committee with its Olympic slogan: “Discover Tomorrow.” But for Tokyo, a hefty bill of $8 billion is a big concern. It needs to build new stadiums and refurbish old ones when its hands are still busy with the containment of the Fukushima plant disaster.
