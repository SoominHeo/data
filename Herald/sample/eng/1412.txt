Harry Potter spin-off films to be created
To the joy of Harry Potter fans, the world of Harry Potter will further expand with a series of new Harry Potter spin-off films, Warner Bros. announced on Sept. 17.
 The new films will be inspired by the Hogwarts textbook “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” which appears in the third novel of the best-selling series. Yet, Rowling warns her fans not to expect more of the boy wizard or his friends in the new films. 
 “Although it will be set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years, ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world,” she commented in a statement. 
 “The laws and customs of hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but Newt’s story will start in New York, 70 years before Harry’s gets underway.”
 “I always said that I would only revisit the wizarding world if I had an idea that I was really excited about and this is it,” the author added. “It all started when Warner Bros. came to me with the suggestion of turning ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ into a film.”
 Set in the wizarding world, the story will feature magical creatures and characters, some of which will be familiar to devoted Harry Potter fans. This will be JK Rowling’s screenwriting debut. So far fan reactions on Twitter have been nothing but positive. 
 Rowling’s seven Harry Potter novels have been sold more than 450 million copies worldwide and turned into eight Harry Potter films. The films earned over $7.7 billion at the global box office, becoming the largest-grossing film franchise in history.
