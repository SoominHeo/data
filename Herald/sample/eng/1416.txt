Germany chooses four more years of Angela Merkel 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has won her third victory in the country’s parliamentary election, BBC News reported on Sept. 23. She will be leading Europe’s biggest economy for four more years. 
 Chancellor Angela Merkel‘s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has won Germany’s election, taking about 41.5 percent of the vote. However there will be a significant change in the outlook of her government this time around as her liberal partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), failed to make it into parliament. 
 The results showed that the FDP won only 4.8 percent of the vote, making it the first time in Germany‘s postwar history that the junior coalition partner has lost national representation in parliament. This means that Merkel is likely to seek a grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) who won 26 percent of the votes in the parliament. She previously worked with SPD in a grand coalition from 2005-09. 
 Her historic win has no doubt solidified her preeminent status in Europe’s political arena. Calling it “a super result” Merkel celebrated the victory with her supporters at CDU headquarters. “We can celebrate tonight because we have done something fantastic,” she said. 
 For the coming weeks, the CDU will be busy trying to form a coalition. People of Germany have spoken and now it is time to see what lasting effects she will bring on Europe and the entire world for the next four years.
