U.S. House committee passes FTA with S. Korea
Yonhap News reported Oct. 5, that the U.S.’ House Ways and Means Committee approved the free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea. 
David Camp, the committee’s chairman, stressed the significance of trade deals as America strove to overcome its grim unemployment outlook.
 “With zero jobs created last month and the unemployment rate hovering above 9 percent, we must look at all opportunities to create American jobs. These agreements do just that,” he said. The bills also need an approval from the Senate.
 The bilateral FTA, called KORUS FTA was signed in 2007 and it is the largest trade pact the U.S. has struck since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
