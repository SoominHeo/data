World’s first 'invisible' building to set up in Korea
There is a new race for the world’s most attention grabbing building; it is no longer world’s tallest or most luxurious building but this time it is about “invisibility.” 
 To spark architecture buffs’ imagination, an “invisible” building is to be put up in Incheon. It will be the first of its kind in the world. 
Forbes magazine and CNN News reported on Sept. 16 that a U.S.-based architecture firm GDS Architects will be building the skyscraper named “Tower Infinity.” This glass-encased tower will be about 450 meters high. It will be mainly used for leisure activities, such as a movie theater, roller coaster, water park and numerous food and beverage outlets. 
Thanks to a system of light emitting diodes (LED) and optical cameras, the building will appear transparent from outside. Cameras will be placed at three different heights on six different sides of the building to capture real-time images of its surroundings. The LED system will project the individual digital images to create a panoramic image that makes its illusion of invisibility possible, the report noted. 
 “We aim to showcase innovative Korean technology while encouraging a more global narrative in the process,” said Charles Wee, GDS design principal. In 2011 GDS won the first prize in a National Design Competition sponsored by the Korea Land & Housing Corporation to provide design and engineering services for the tower.
 The completion date for the much-anticipated building has not yet been set.
