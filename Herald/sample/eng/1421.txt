Importance of seeking and having social support
From childhood, people from all over the world have intuitively known that there are lots of benefits to having friends and family. Without having to be told why, people tend to find themselves looking to establish relationships with friends and family members, knowing in their hearts that developing such relationships is important. 
Most recently, a study on cancer survivors pointed to a link between such relationships and cancer survival rates. Published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on Sept. 23, the study suggested that marital status may be one of the defining factors for surviving cancer in adults. Specifically, the study found that married people with cancer were 20 percent less likely to die from the disease compared to those who were single, divorced or separated from their spouses.
 The study stresses that having the social support of a spouse was more important than the act of marriage itself. The results showed that married people had a higher rate of survival regardless of the type of cancer. For certain types of tumors, marriage was a better indicator of survival than chemotherapy.
 “We don’t just see our study as an affirmation of marriage,” said senior author and radiation oncologist Paul Nguyen in an interview with CNN. “But rather it should send a message to anyone who has a friend or a loved one with cancer: By being there for that person and helping them navigate their appointments and make it through all their treatments, you can make a real difference to that person’s outcome.”
 A particularly interesting trend found in the study on marital status and cancer survival was that men with cancer showed a greater benefit from marriage than their female counterparts. Rather than concluding that husbands are not as supportive of wives as wives are of husbands, the study pointed to the well-established theory that women are more likely to reach out for help and support than men.
