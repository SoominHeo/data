Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson reveals secrets to success
Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse has been studying the leadership methods of Sir Alex Ferguson, the most successful manager in British soccer. 
 She recently revealed in the Harvard Business Review Sir Alex‘s eight methods, dubbed the “Ferguson Formula,” behind turning Manchester United into a global powerhouse.　
 When Ferguson became manager in 1986, Manchester United hadn’t won the league in two decades. He spent six seasons building the team from scratch and by the time he retired this year, he had won 13 league titles and made Manchester United the most prominent soccer club in the world. 
 To briefly state the eight secrets to his successful career, first, he put emphasis on building a robust foundation of his team. He was eager to bring in young players rather than including veterans.
 Second, he was confident of building the team from scratch. It was reported that Ferguson had not been afraid of being fired, so he made bold decisions to reshape the team. 
Third, he let everyone in the club knew about his high standards. 
“I used to be the first to arrive in the morning. In my later years, a lot of my staff members would already be there when I got in at 7 a.m. I think they understood why I came in early ? they knew there was a job to be done,” he said. 
 Fourth, he knew the importance of maintaining his control in the team. He said that if a player tried to rein in his power as the team manager, he did not budge.
 Fifth, he was ready to offer critical evaluations to players.
 Sixth, he took risks and was prepared to win; and he used countless smart strategies. 
 Seventh, he believed in the power of observation. 
Last but not least was his superb ability to adapt to changes. His success was rooted in adapting quickly to new environments.
 Those eight methods could be applied to various professions for those who would like to be as successful as Ferguson, the report noted.
