Every father is a child’s hero
The father in the film “Hero” seems like he lacks something on every level -– he has no job and no money to treat his sick son -- the one thing that he has to be proud of is his deep love for his son, Kyu-won.
 Kyu-won has an incurable disease, but he is happy when watching a TV show featuring a heroic character, “Thunderman.” One day, the show is cancelled and Kyu-won becomes depressed. To cheer up his son the father meets the show’s director, asking for the show to be rerun. Referring the classic novel, “The Last Leaf” by O Henry, that the show could save his son’s life like a no-name artist saved a dying girl’s life, the father manages to convince the director. The father ends up playing the film’s main character, Thunderman. Connected to a wire he has to fly and jump around for the film’s scenes. But making Kyu-won happy puts a huge smile on his face.
 Then an ex-convict who mistakes the father as one of the original actors from the show tries to harm him. He sets fire to the movie set and eventually kidnaps Kyu-won. To save his son the father fights against the villain and is struck by lightning. He now turns into a real life Thunderman.
 The movie talks about a father’s unfathomable love and sacrifices for his child. No matter how successful, wealthy and powerful he is in his life, for his kid, he is the same dad who is his greatest hero. 
 Actor Oh Jung-sae played the incompetent father in the film and comedian Jung Eun-pyo starred as the lame but high maintenance movie director. His real life daughter Jung Ha-eun also appeared in the film as Kyu-won’s hospital buddy. Her adult-like expressions added refreshing joy to the film. Overall, the film “Hero” was a heart-warming family movie suitable for this chilly weather.
