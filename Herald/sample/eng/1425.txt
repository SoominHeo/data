Paju getaway: A calming bonsai garden
On a small hill in the northern Gyeonggi Province city of Paju, Soulone, a newly opened tree garden, is poised to become a key attraction in the border city. 
Close to some popular destinations such as Imjingak and the dynamic cultural scenes in Heyri Art Village and Paju Book City, the garden is an accessible and inviting respite from city life.
 Soulone is home to some rare forms of garden trees, bonsai trees and viewing stones. Viewing trees and stones have a long tradition in East Asia, where people collected them to decorate their courtyards and gardens.
 On the 10,349-square-meter area, trees and stones are on display like works of art. Each tree is notable in age, shape and history, according to the garden officials.
 The garden is home to pine trees, zelkova, maple trees and cornelian cherry dogwood trees that are as old as 300 to 600 years.
 The 300-year-old pine tree resembles the motion of a dragon ascending to heaven, according to Lee Bum-uk, owner of Soulone and president of an advertising firm based in Seoul.
 “The powerful line of the tree trunk and the delicate flow of the stems make it one of the best garden trees that one can find in this country,” Lee said. 
Twin cornelian cherry dogwood trees that are 400 and 500 years old, respectively, are fun to compare as one has masculine features in the “muscular” tree trunk and the other standing across from it has feminine features in its slimmer trunk and curvy stems. 
Some unique tree forms were created with the skillful hands of a gardener such as those created by weaving a dead tree and a living tree together. 
Adjacent to the garden is a building with a coffee shop and a restaurant. More spaces are being created to accommodate small weddings, parties and gatherings. 
Admission to the garden is 3,000 won for students and Paju citizens and 5,000 won for adults.
