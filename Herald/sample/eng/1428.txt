U.S. government shuts down
.S. Congress refused to raise the federal debt limit on Oct.1, giving way to the nation’s first default in 17 years. 
The U.S. government shutdown is caused by the budget standoff between President Barack Obama and Congress. 
If the situation continues with no agreement to raise the country’s borrowing limit, the U.S. government will run out of money, the U.S. Treasury warned. The impact of being unable to release the budget deadlock could last for “more than a generation,” it forecasts.
 IMF head Christine Lagarde also raised a red flag, saying failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling would be catastrophic to the world economy. 
After the epic budget battle, the U.S. government closed non-essential operations on Oct. 1. The shutdown has left more than 700,000 employees on unpaid leave and closed national parks, tourist sites, government websites and office buildings.
 Obama urged the speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, to bring a spending bill to a vote to end the shutdown “right now.” He said that unlike previous budget battles, this time it was derived from the effort to cancel his signature domestic legislative achievement. 
“This is not about spending and this is not about fiscal responsibility, this whole thing is about one thing: the Republican obsession with dismantling the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said. 
The failing to strike a deal on a new budget is costing the U.S. economy an estimated $300m a day, BBC report stated.
