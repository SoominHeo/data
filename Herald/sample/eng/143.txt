N. Korean defectors face deportation in China
A South Korean humanitarian group said Oct. 2 that thirty-five North Korean defectors were arrested in China and would soon be sent back to their country.
 The Commission to Help North Korean Refugees (CNKR) urged the Chinese government to immediately release the defectors.
 People who get returned to their country are said to face cruel punishments such as torture and public execution, Yonhap News reported.
 Since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, more than 20,000 North Koreans have come to South Korea and many used China as the first country on their way here. 
Human rights activists believe that there are approximately 100,000 North Koreans in China.
