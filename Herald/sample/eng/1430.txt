NYC prison time costs more than Ivy League education
A recent report found that the costs of jailing an inmate in New York City for one year costs more than four years’ worth of tuition at an Ivy League university.
 Compiled by the Independent Budget Office, the report found that it cost $167,731 (180 million won) to house each of the 12,287 daily inmates in New York in 2012, roughly $460 per inmate per day. For comparison, undergraduate tuition at Harvard University is currently set at $38,891 per year, or approximately $155,564 for a four-year degree. At Yonsei University, notorious for having one of highest tuition rates in Korea, the average tuition for the 2013 school year is approximately $4,500 (4.8 million won). Without taking into consideration inflation, the total tuition cost for a four-year undergraduate degree at Yonsei University would be approximately $17,800 (19. 2 million won). +
 Not only does New York spend more money per inmate than a student would need to attain a four-year college degree at almost any university, it spends more than most other large cities as well. Los Angeles, for example, spent an average of $128.94 per day, or $47,063 per year between 2011 and 2012, while Chicago spent $145 per inmate per day, or $52,925 per year. 
Experts say that the high cost of jailing inmates in New York is as a result of the discrepancy between current incarceration rates and the city’s archaic system of having certain expensive fixed costs. Another factor is the hundreds of millions of dollars spent per year to keep Rikers Island, the notorious NYC prison complex operating on its own island, in operation.
 “Other cities don’t have Rikers Island,” Martin F. Horn, who resigned as New York’s correction commissioner in 2009, told AP. Rikers Island costs hundreds of millions of dollars to run, in part because it has its own power plant and bakery, as well as the capacity to house roughly 15,000 inmates alone, Horn explained.
