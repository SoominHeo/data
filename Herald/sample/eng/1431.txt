Giant hornets kill 42 Chinese people
Thumb-sized wasps have attacked people in China, killing dozens and injuring more than 1,500, CNN reported on Oct. 3 
Since July, these giant insects have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 in three cities in Shaanxi province, attacking mostly school children and farmers in the neighborhood.
 Thousands of police officers are said to have been deployed to the area to destroy the bee hives and about 710 of them have been removed.
 According to Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona, the giant Asian hornet with its scientific moniker of Vespa mandarinia has a powerful venomous sting that can destroy red blood cells and cause kidney failure and death. The toxicity of venom also leads to serious allergic reactions as well as possibly cardiac arrest, he said.
 The horrifying insects are found throughout East and Southeast Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, India and Nepal. The size of the insect is about 3.5 to 3.9 centimeters in length, roughly the size of a human thumb and the queens are even bigger with their bodies growing longer than 5 centimeters, said the report.
 They are attracted to human sweat, alcohol and sweet smells. Unusually dry weather and a decrease in the hornets’ enemies, such as spiders and birds have been named the primary causes of their growth. 
In order to avoid the danger of hornet attacks, the report advised people to stay calm and not to freak out. “The more you run, the more they want to chase you,” one of the hornet victims said in the report.
