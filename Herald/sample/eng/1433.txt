Korean-born Russian speed skater no threat to national team
Korean short track speed skaters participating in the second leg of World Cup competition held here in Seoul, Korea from Oct. 3 to 6 said they are not concerned about a former national-team skater now representing Russia.
 During the event at Seoul’s Mokdong Ice Rink, sponsored by the International Skating Union, Korean skaters competed against a South Korean-born Russian short tracker Ahn Hyun-soo, now called Victor Ahn.
 It was Ahn’s first competition in Korea since his acquisition of Russian citizenship. 
Ahn, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, took Russian citizenship in Dec. 2011 to play at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. He is one of the most decorated short trackers in history, earning three gold medals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. 
His latest record has been remarkable; he grabbed four titles in last year’s World Cup competition and also earned two silver medals at the world championships held earlier this year.
 No matter how fearful Ahn could be, the rest of the Korean national team also said they were not too worried about Ahn’s presence at the game. 
“Ahn will be just one of the foreign skaters,” Yoon Jae-myung, head coach of the men’s team, insisted. 
“I am more concerned about Charles Hamelin,” said Sin Da-woon, the reigning overall world champion, referring to the Canadian skater who won two races at the previous World Cup event held in Shanghai last month. 
“My biggest goal this week is to beat Hamelin,” Sin added.
