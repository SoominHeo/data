After his stellar 16-year tenure at Parisian luxury brand Louis Vuitton, the 50-year-old American designer known for his showmanship is to wrap up his work and ready to leave the global fashion house to focus on his own brand, Marc by Marc Jacobs. 
At the Spring-Summer 2014 Fashion Show in Paris this month, audiences gave Marc Jacobs a standing ovation for his last show as the creative director at Louis Vuitton.
 He dedicated his last show to “the women who inspire me and the showgirl in every one of them.” On his decorated list were Jane Birkin, Betty Catroux, Catherine Deneuve, Edith Piaf, Liza Minnelli, Kate Moss, Barbra Streisand and Vivienne Westwood. 
Not only his brands but Marc Jacobs, the designer has been dearly adored by throngs of Hollywood stars and people in the entertainment industry. His brand was also famous for producing women’s handbags named and designed after famous models and celebrities. Marc Jacob’s Stam bag, created after global fashion model Jessica Stam was one of the best selling items from his brand. Korean fashion model Hye Park also has her own Marc Jacobs bag named after her.
