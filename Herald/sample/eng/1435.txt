Unlikely star of ‘Old Partner’ Choi Won-gyoon
Choi Won-gyoon, star of the 2009 documentary film “Old Partner,” passed away on Oct. 1 at the age of 85 after a 10-month-long battle with cancer.
 Diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer in November 2012, Choi rose to fame thanks to “Old Partner,” an award-winning documentary film that chronicled two years in the lives of a hard-working couple in rural Korea as they awaited the death of their aging bull.
 Described as a fable about love, loyalty and rural Korean values, the documentary film and its subjects stole the hearts of many as with was both heartwarming and a funny story about a wife jealous of her husband’s affection for their hardworking and faithful bull. Unfortunately, the popularity of the film and its ensuing intrusion on their once-tranquil lives began to take its toll. 
As a man who spent his entire life as an average farmer in rural Korea, Choi was uncomfortable with the fame brought on by his appearance in “Old Partner.” The film achieved unprecedented success, shattering box-office records for independent films and bringing first-time director Lee Chung-ryoul overnight success. 
Although Choi continued to go about his business as usual, the sudden influx of tourists looking to meet and take pictures with the now-famous couple brought about disruptions on their daily lives. Those who saw the film also began to needlessly criticize his nine children, accusing them of abandoning their hardworking parents and fighting over money earned from the film. These unfounded criticisms were particularly distressing to friends and family members of Choi.
 Surprisingly, Choi himself had never seen “Old Partner.” Unsurprisingly, he continued to get up early every morning to tend to the fields, working hard right up until his diagnosis last November. His recent passing was mourned by many across the nation.
 Choi is survived by his wife, 82-year-old Lee Sam-sun, and his nine children.
