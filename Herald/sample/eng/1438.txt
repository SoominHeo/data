Fed to get first female head
U.S. President Barack Obama has nominated Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Vice Chair, to run the nation’s central bank, AP reported on Oct. 9.
 If the president’s nomination is confirmed without Republican opposition, Yellen, 67, will be the first woman to lead the 100-year-old institution, on top of being the first female to head a central bank in any Group of Seven industrial nation. 
 “Janet is exceptionally well qualified for this role,” Obama said at a White House ceremony. 
 Yellen is expected to continue the policies of her departing boss, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, whose term ends Jan. 31. Bernanke will have served two terms as the head of the world’s most influential financial institution.
 She pledged to find jobs for the unemployed and promote stable prices and a sound financial system. She is known to take aggressive action to stimulate U.S. economic growth through low interest rates and large-scale bond purchases, the report said.
 What is the Federal Reserve?
The Federal Reserve System, also known as the Federal Reserve, and informally as the Fed, is the central banking system of the United States. It was established on Dec. 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in response to a series of severe financial crisis in the U.S.
 The primary function of the Federal Reserve is to maintain the stability of the financial system. The Fed addresses banking panics, strikes a balance between the private interests of banks, supervises and regulates banking institutions, protects the credit rights of consumers and manages U.S. money supply through monetary policy.
