Scientists who explained existence of Higgs boson win Nobel physics prize
Physicists Peter Higgs of Britain and Francois Englert of Belgium were named winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in physics on Oct. 8 for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.
 The Boson theory explains a mechanism why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass. The Higgs boson has been regarded as a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics. The Higgs boson was initially discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland.
 The two scientists’ theoretical discovery of the boson mechanism has contributed to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, the Nobel committee said.
 “I am overwhelmed to receive this award ... I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle,” Peter Higgs, 84, Emeritus professor of theoretical physics, University of Edinburgh, said after hearing the announcement. He began his research on why the matter in the Universe has substance in Edinburgh in 1964.
 Francois Englert, 80, the other winner, also said he was “very happy” to win the award.
 Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking praised their accomplishment: “In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson.”
 The winners will get $1.2m in prize money, a medal, a diploma and undeniable respect from around the world.
