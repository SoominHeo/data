Which countries respect their teachers the most?
For as long as humans have known how to communicate, teachers have, by and large, played a vital role in advancing society and ensuring the survival of our species. 
Learning and, by extension, education, have long played an important role in our survival, as well as the development and advancement of society. Without teachers propagating their knowledge onto students through education, society would be very different. Awareness of history would be limited to those who lived through it and the basic skills we take for granted, such as the ability to count numbers, read and write, would be inconceivable to the vast majority of the world’s population. 
In the past, teachers, or educators, were some of the most highly-respected people in society due to their pivotal role in educating the young on the group’s values, beliefs and principles. However, as the basic structure of society began to evolve and priorities began to change, respect for teachers has dwindled in many cultures. 　
 A recent survey on the social standing of teachers around the world today by the Varkey Gems Foundation yielded some interesting information. In some parts of the world, such as China and South Korea, teachers are still held in high esteem, though in places like Israel, teachers are not trusted to deliver quality education to students. 
According to survey results, China had the most respect for teachers, followed by Greece, Turkey and South Korea. In fact, the survey found that more that 75 percent of respondents in China believed that students respected their teachers compared to the average of 27 percent per country. Interestingly, though teachers are thought of highly in Korea, only 1 in 10 respondents believed that students would be respectful toward teachers at school, the lowest among the 21 nations surveyed.
