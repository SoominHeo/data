Yang’s signature technique ‘Yang 2’ officially listed by FIG
At the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships at Antwerp, Belgium on Oct.7, 20-year-old gymnast Yang Hak-seon killed two birds with one stone.
 Not only did he defend his second straight vault title at the event, his signature “Yang 2” technique was listed by the FIG (International Federation of Gymnastics) as an official vault technique with a 6.4 difficulty level.
 His victory at Antwerp made him the first Korean gymnast to defend a world championship title after Yoo Ok-ryul who topped the vault competitions in 1991 and 1992. With the “Yang 2” technique officially listed by the FIG, he became the first athlete in the world to have two 6.4-level vault techniques named after him.
 At the finals, the gymnast earned 15.166 points in his first attempt by performing Yeo 2, a signature vault technique created by former Korean gymnast Yeo Hong-chul. Yeo tried his signature moves dubbed “Yeo 1” and “Yeo 2” during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but did not win gold medals due to major mistakes on his landings. Yeo 2 has a 6.0 difficulty rating. In his the second try, Yang garnered 15.433 points by playing a triple twist known as the Tsukahara which was also has a 6.0 difficulty rating. 
 Yang didn’t perform either of his signature techniques, Yanghakseon, a handspring triple twist named after him, or his latest move the “Yang 2.” However, his new technique “Yang 2” was officially approved by the International Federation of Gymnastics as a vault technique with a 6.4 difficulty level. The Korean Gymnastic Association reportedly submitted a video clip showing Yang performing the “Yang 2” ahead of the event. 
 Yang previously won the 2010 Asian Games, 2011 Tokyo World Championships and brought home the country’s first ever Olympic gold medal last year.
