IU makes comeback after 17 months away
Nearly 1 1/2 years since her previous album, “Spring of a Twenty Year Old,” 20-year-old K-pop princess IU released her third full-length album, “Modern Times.”
 Upon its release on Oct. 8, “The Pink Shoes,” the lead track from the latest album, swept more than nine local online music charts including Melon, Naver, Mnet, Cyworld Music, Bugs, Monkey 3, Olleh music, Soribada and Daum. The lyrics of the title song are based on a classic story of Hans Christian Andersen, in which a girl cannot stop dancing when wearing a pair of pink shoes.
 The album which has 13 tracks has been playing well with the public, with most songs making the Top 10 spots on online music charts.
 The album is produced by Cho Young-chul and includes a variety of genres including jazz, bossa nova, and Latin pop. It took nine months to prepare the album, her agency Loen Entertainment noted. She even composed two tracks from the album, “Voice Mail” and “A Day I Hate.”
 IU gained fame with her innocent, teenage looks, but with her latest album “Modern Times” she decided to shift gears. Her black-and-white teaser photo confirms that she is no longer a girl next door but rather a chic, mature woman as she sports long wavy hair and poses with a guitar. 
 Lately, the singer has been focusing on acting, playing the lead role in the KBS drama “You’re the Best, Lee Soon-shin.”
