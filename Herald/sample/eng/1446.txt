President Choi Kyu-hah
The residence of former Korean President, the late Choi Kyu-hah, opened its doors to the public as a site for history education on Oct. 5. 
Registered as Cultural Asset No. 413, the two-story house was the residence of Choi from 1973 until he was appointed prime minister in 1976, and then again in his later years, when he retired from the presidency in 1980 until his death in 2006.
 Born in 1919 in Wonju, Gangwon Province, Choi joined the government administration in 1946 when he began working at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, a year after the country’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. 
Upon Park Chung-hee’s election and inauguration as president in 1963, Choi served in various Cabinet posts under Park; most notably as foreign minister from 1947 to 1971, special presidential adviser for foreign affairs from 1971 to 1975 and then as prime minister from 1976 to 1979.
 Choi was eventually appointed President of South Korea in 1979, heading the nation’s 10th administration, following the assassination of the late former President Park Chung-hee in October of the same year. 
Choi’s legacy as president was short-lived, however, when he was forced to step down in 1980 following a coup d’état staged by then-Maj. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan.
 Upon his sudden death in 2006, a funeral service was held at the Seoul National University Hospital, which was attended by former presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who offered their condolences to the bereaved family. 
“As one of the greatest figures in our diplomatic history, the late president [Choi] contributed greatly to our nation,” the late President Kim Dae-jung reportedly told the family. 
A state funeral was held for Choi after a six-day mourning period as authorized by the government under then-President Roh Moo-hyun. Choi was buried on Oct. 26, 2006 at the Daejeon National Cemetery.
