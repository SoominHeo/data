 Tongyeong is a small fishing port city famous for fresh seafood. The small city attracts thousands of tourists throughout the year just to taste the country’s best seafood. On top of being one of Korea’s best culinary destinations, the city is also the birthplace of many of the country’s great novelists, poets and artists: Novelist Park Kyung-ni, poet Ryu Chi-hwan, painter Jeon Hyuck-lim and composer Yun Isang all hail from Tongyeong.
 The celebrated cultural figures’ birthplaces, memorial halls and museums are scattered throughout the city and in 2011, the Tongyeong Cultural Foundation created a cultural trail that connects the spots. 
The cultural trail is the first walking trail of Tongyeong’s “Iyagil.” Derived from the regional dialect - “Iya” means sister - the 9.4-kilometer trail invites tourists to a visitor-friendly walking experience akin to walking with their brothers or sisters.
 “The cultural trail follows the traces of Tongyeong’s cultural figures. It goes to birthplaces, memorial halls and museums,” said Lee Mi-hee of Tongyeong city’s tourism department. 
The city also created a second trail named Mireukdogil that goes around Mireukdo Island, which is connected to the main city by bridge. From the island’s highest mountain, one can take in the breathtaking scenery of the peninsula’s south coast, dotted with hundreds of small islands. 
The scarcity of signs along the trails and lack of maps offering information on the walking trails make it difficult to follow the paths, and a useful guide is a walking tour mobile app created by the Culture Ministry which pinpoints each destination on a Naver mobile map and suggests a path to follow.
