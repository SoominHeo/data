Comic Con rocks New York City
Thousands clad in colorful and elaborate superhero, supervillain, wizard, alien and cartoon character costumes invaded New York City on Oct. 11 for the annual New York Comic Con (NYCC).
 NYCC is an annual event celebrating comic books, animation, video games, movies, and cartoon shows. This year’s four-day convention attracted an estimated 130,000 people to the Javits Center in Manhattan.
 Fans took part in a costume parade, dressing up as characters from “The Walking Dead,” a TV show depicting the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. Presentations about animated TV series including “The Legend of Korra” and a play about the creation of Batman were also held. 
Kids also had an opportunity to meet their favorite TV and movie stars and popular comic-book writers such as Stan Lee, who co-created Spider-Man, the Hulk, X-Men, and The Avengers. 
 “He’s one of my favorite comic-book writers,” one of the attendees said of Lee.
 The event’s special guests included wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and reclusive Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin. The 33-year-old former actor, who retired from movies at 14, visited the venue on Oct. 11, looking healthy and relaxed, E! News reported. 
 The NYCC is a for-profit annual convention about comics, graphic novels, animation, video games, and toys. It is one of the largest comic book and science fiction conventions, and was first held in 2006 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
