Reading boosts math skills
A new study by academics at the Institute of Education, part of the University of London, revealed that children who read for pleasure are not only better at English but are also better at mathematics. 
In the study, researchers found that children who received bedtime stories from their parents as infants performed better in overall tests. The significance of reading on children’s studies increased in their secondary school years with children who had regular access to books between the ages of 10 and 16 having a 14.4 percent advantage in vocabulary, a 9.9 percent advantage in maths and an 8.6 percent advantage in spelling. 
 The findings suggest that reading at an older age is more important to children’s development than the influence of parents who have a university degree.
 “It may seem surprising that reading for pleasure would help to improve children’s maths scores. But it is likely that strong reading ability will enable children to absorb and understand new information and affect their attainment in all subjects,” the study’s co-author Dr. Alice Sullivan said.
 Sullivan noted concerns that today’s young people are less likely to read for pleasure for various reasons including spending more time on organized activities, doing homework, using iPads and smartphones and playing online games.
 “However, new technologies, such as e-readers, can offer easy access to books and newspapers and it is important that government policies support and encourage children’s reading, particularly in their teenage years,” she added.
