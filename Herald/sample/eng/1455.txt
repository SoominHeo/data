Ryu becomes first Korean pitcher to win in MLB postseason
Ryu Hyun-jin of the Los Angeles Dodgers threw seven shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals on Oct. 7, becoming the first Korean pitcher to grab a starting win in the Major League Baseball postseason.
 In the game at Dodger Stadium, Ryu allowed only three hits and struck out four batters in seven innings, leading his team to a 3-0 win in the third game of the National League Championship Series.
 Ryu produced a career-best performance with a fastball of around 153 kilometers per hour and a variety of breaking balls. He left the mound with his team leading by 2-0.
 With the victory, Ryu became the first Korean pitcher to grab a starting win in the Major League Baseball postseason and the fourth starting pitcher in Dodgers history to throw seven or more scoreless innings and allow three or fewer hits in a postseason game. 
 For the Dodgers, it was the first postseason shutout against St. Louis since 2004.
 After the game, Ryu said the game was the hardest-throwing of his career. CBS sports, the sports division of the American television network CBS, praised Ryu’s play on the day stating: “Dodger’s third line pitcher showed an outstanding performance. Ryu earned an overall score of A.” CBS sports also gave LA Dodgers B+ for the game while giving a D score for the Cardinals.
