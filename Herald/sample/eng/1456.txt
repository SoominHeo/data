SBS to launch celebrity fashion reality show
For the first time on Korean TV, SBS is pairing some of the nation’s top designers with celebrities to create fashion in a battle-to-the-top survival competition. 
 The soon-to-be-aired reality show titled “Fashion King Korea” will feature a team of eight celebrities, each paired with an acclaimed fashion designer. The all-star cast of celebrities competing against one another are: Girls’ Generation’s Tiffany, Sistar’s Bora, TV personality Kim Na-young, musician Yoon gun, TV personality Boom, artist Lee Ji-hoon, Chu Mi-rim and artist Im Dong-wook.
 The cast of fashion designers includes Park Yoon-jung, Lee Joo-young, Jung Doo-young, Ji Il-keun, Lee Ji-eun, Jang Hyung-chul, Nam Yoon-jae and Kim Hong-bum. 
 In the show, the teams will compete against one another in various fashion challenges and missions. The lowest-scoring team each week is eliminated from the competition. Some of the show’s competing pairs include Team Tiffany and Ji Il-keun; Team Bora and Lee Joo-young; Team Boom and Park Yoon-jung; and Team Jung Doo-young and Kim Na-young. 
 “I am just very thankful to have a chance to work closely with designer Ji Il-keun as well as having the opportunity to compete for the title of fashion king,” said Tiffany. 
 The producers said their goal for the show was not only to provide audience members with entertainment, but also to inspire new and inspiring designs. 
 “Fashion King Korea” will premiere on Nov. 17 on SBS.
