Helicopter rides show Hangang as never before
Seoulâ€™s first tourist helicopter service that provides aerial view of Hangang River and high-rise buildings opened on Oct. 16.
 Similar services are widely available in major cities of the United States and Australia, but it is the first time Seoul launches such service flying over the signature skyscrapers and tourist attractions.
 Run by Blue Airlines, the tour packages offer sightseeing on four routes including Jamsil and Yeouido.
 Four helicopter routes are available, all departing from Jamsil heliport in southeast Seoul.
 The Jamsil and Korea World Trade Center route will offer views of the Gangnam area, while the Yeouido and Gwangnaru courses will give opportunities to see the city center and eastern areas, respectively. 
 The rides will take around 5 to 15 minutes and prices will vary from 55,000 won to 200,000 won, depending on the route. 
Blue Airlines, a Korean tourist flight company, will be in charge of operating the four-seat Robinson's R-44 helicopters and managing the business.
 The air service is for both domestic and foreign nationals, but Blue Airlines officials expected that it would be more enjoyed by foreign tourists.
 The officials said the first service of the kind in the country will be successfully operated considering the growing number of foreign tourists to the capital city.
