Violin played while Titanic sank fetches record price
Many “Titanic” fans will recall the scene in which the brave band members continued to play as the ship went down. The musicians reportedly played the piece “Nearer My God To Thee” to calm the passengers. The very violin played by the band leader Wallace Hartley, who died along with 1,517 others on the world’s most luxurious cruise liner, was sold at auction on Oct. 19 in Wiltshire, Britain for £900,000 ($1.45 million).
 Hartley, a musician from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, reportedly got the instrument from his fiancée, Maria Robinson, as an engagement present.
 Despite skepticism that it could have survived the sinking, the violin was authenticated through salt deposits in the wood. It survived the salty sea water in a leather case which Harley strapped to his body. 
 The instrument was then returned to his fiancée and following her death in 1939 was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and passed on to the current owner in the 1940s. 
 With fierce bidding between two telephone bidders, the price rose to £900,000, setting a new world record for a single Titanic item. The buyer is believed to be British.
 The violin is the rarest and most iconic piece of Titanic memorabilia there is, insisted auctioneer Alan Aldridge. Many other items from the ship also went up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery; but they were sold for between £10 and a few hundred pounds.
