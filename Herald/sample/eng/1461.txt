EVD players make ‘Korean wave’ unstoppable in N. Korea: seminar
The proliferation of China-made enhanced versatile disc (EVD) players in North Korea is making it harder for authorities to crack down on citizens watching South Korean shows, a number of experts suggested. 
 During an academic seminar hosted by the North Korean Strategy Center on Oct. 22, Dong-a University professor Kang Dong-won explained that since 2005, when the cheap, Chinese-made “portable TVs” began arriving in North Korea, North Koreans have been able to watch various movies and dramas made in the South, fueling the spread of the “Korean wave” in the communist country. 
 “The advantage of the EVDs is that they can play various CDs, DVDs and support USB as well as game playing capabilities,” Kang said, adding that they are relatively cheap at approximately 60,000 won per player. He added that DVDs containing pirated South Korean entertainment shows cost just 1,000 won. 
 During the seminar, North Korean defector Lee Jung-chol (alias) described the effect that the spread of EVD players has had in the North. Lee, who worked for the North Korean government before defecting in 2011, said that in 2009, North Korea’s National Security Agency determined there were some 2,000 South Korean dramas circulating in Pyongyang alone. 
 “At every market in North Korea you can find USB sticks with South Korean movies and dramas stored on them. They are basically sold out in the open,” he said. “People are even watching them in central Pyongyang. There is a lot of talk among students about ‘South Korean style.’”
 In fact, Lee went so far as to say that nowadays in North Korea, “if you don’t watch [South Korean] movies and dramas you’re treated as an idiot.”
