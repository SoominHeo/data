Why do rising milk prices make other food pricier?
In recent months, Korea has seen a hike in milk prices, leading consumers and critics alike to worry about the effect on the cost of other food products. 
 Consumers have had to sit back and watch as major grocery stores across the nation raised milk prices between 10 and 12 percent, citing a spike in the price of raw milk. 
 More than just higher milk prices, consumers and market watchers alike are worried about a domino effect on the prices of other goods and services, such as cookies, bread, ice-cream, yogurt, cheese and butter. 
 Though it would seem strange to worry about the price of coffee or bread when it is the price of milk that is being raised, it is important to know that milk costs affect the cost of all goods that require milk, or any other dairy ingredient such as butter, to be produced. It may be surprising at first, but the actions of the milk and dairy industry can have considerable impact on other segments of the food industry. 
 For example, you may have already guessed that higher milk prices will lead to more expensive cheese. However, have you considered how higher cheese prices may then affect the cost of buying a pizza at your local pizzeria? Regardless of what toppings you include when ordering a pizza, cheese is a basic ingredient. The same can be said about the cost of burgers with a slice of cheese, cookies that use butter as an ingredient, and even ice cream. 
 With the rising cost of milk, it is hard to ignore the impact on the price of our favorite, albeit unhealthy, foods.
