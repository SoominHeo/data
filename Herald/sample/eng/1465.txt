Korea shifts focus to ‘Delicious Travel’ to draw tourists
The Korea Tourism Organization (KTO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, recently announced its decision to shift its focus to Korean food in an effort to draw more foreign tourists. 
 “Food is one of the key things to look forward to when traveling,” Kim Young-ho, the director of tourism competitiveness at the KTO, told The Korea Herald. “When Japanese tourists come to Korea, one of the first things they talk about is not the shopping, it’s the food.”
 In fact, a recent survey of tourists conducted by the KTO found that 15.2 percent of respondents cited food as an important factor in their traveling decisions. The results represent a significant rise from 6.2 percent in a 2008 survey. Additionally, a separate survey conducted by Corea Image Communication Institute between Sept. 23 and Oct. 18 found that 41.3 percent of foreign respondents chose Korea’s food industry as the area with the greatest growth potential for promoting the nation’s image.
 For the fall season, tourism officials at KTO will be running a wide range of programs as part of its “Delicious Travel” campaign highlighting delicious and popular local cuisine from each of the country’s provinces. The campaign, which will be held from Oct. 15 to Dec. 15, comes in light of Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong’s assertion that the government should shift support from the entertainment industry to food, or “hansik,” in an effort to extend the Korean culture boom around the world. 
 According to The Korea Herald, the goal of the “Delicious Travel” campaign is to assist food-conscious tourists in their travels as well as to encourage tourists to experience Korea’s diverse food culture beyond the bounds of Seoul.
