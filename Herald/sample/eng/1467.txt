Being different is okay, says ‘White Gorilla’
The film “Snowflake, the White Gorilla” is based on the true story of the world’s only known white gorilla, named “Snowflake,” or “Copito de nieve” in Spanish, at Spain’s Barcelona Zoo.
 The movie conveys the message that being different is okay and everyone should accept others the way they are. 
 Snowflake is living in Africa with his mother but when she passes away he is bought by a man who worked for the zoo in Barcelona. Snowflake gets to know the man’s family and becomes close friends with the daughter, Paula. 
 On his arrival at the zoo, he becomes the most popular resident. People come just to have a look at his unique white color. He becomes the zoo’s major attraction and the center of attention. Kids and adults alike adore him. 
 Although being special makes him loved by many, Snowflake is disliked by his own kind -- regular gorillas. They get mad at Snowflake for getting all the attention from visitors. Saddened by his kind’s disapproval and hoping to mingle with them, Snowflake decides to change his looks. 
 Wanting to fit in with the other gorillas at the zoo, Snowflake plans to visit a witch and asks her to turn him into a normal gorilla. Uncle Sam, a Buddhist black panther reincarnated into the body of a red panda, helps him sneak out of the zoo. But the outside world is filled with great danger. One lunatic tries to steal Snowflake’s heart to reverse his bad luck, but Paula saves the day.
 In the end, she helps Snowflake realize that there is nothing wrong with being different and his friends also learn to accept him as he is. 
 “Snowflake, the White Gorilla” hit theaters nationwide on Oct. 31.
