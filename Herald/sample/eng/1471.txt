Tiananmen Square attack highlights minority struggle
Chinese police rounded up two suspects of a deadly car crash in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square that took the lives of five bystanders and injured 38 people.
 Tourists from the Philippines and from China’s Guangdong province were among those killed in the incident as the vehicle crashed into pedestrians and burst into flames. Among the injured, there were three tourists from the Philippines and one from Japan. 
 Police shut down the scene of the incident -- the north end of the square at an entrance to the Forbidden City -- shortly after the attack and nearby subway station and roads were forced to close, the Xinhua news agency reported on Oct. 30. 
 Police said that the suspects ignited petrol inside the car and that a flag written with extremist religious slogans was found inside the vehicle. Five suspects in connection with the “violent terror attack,” which police described as “carefully planned and organized,” were revealed to be from the Muslim Uighur minority in the Xinjiang region.　
 Xinjiang is home to the Uighur minority in China, which has long voiced complaints of cultural and religious repression by the Chinese government. The government said the violence derived from chronic disputes between Uighur minority and government officials over religious freedom. 
 There have been a series of violent outbreaks in the area. In June this year, riots in Xingjian’s Turpan prefecture in Shanshan county killed 27 people and in April another incident in the city of Kashgar left 21 people dead.
