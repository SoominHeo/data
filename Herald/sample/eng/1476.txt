Sitting straight could be bad for your back
Contrary to conventional wisdom, a study by Scottish and Canadian researchers found that sitting up straight is in fact not good for people’s backs.
 Researchers told the Radiological Society of North America, an international society of radiologists, medical physicists and other medical professionals, that the best position to sit is leaning back, at about 135 degrees. 
 The research was carried out at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen, England where magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan spinal angles, spinal disk height and movement of 22 volunteers’ healthy backs.
 In this study, participants took three different sitting positions: a slouching position, in which the body is hunched forward, a 90-degree sitting position and a “relaxed” position where they leaned back at 135 degrees with their feet left on the floor. 
 The result showed that spinal disk movement, which causes back pain, was found most frequently in those with a 90-degree posture. It was least pronounced with the 135-degree posture, suggesting less strain is placed on backs in a more relaxed sitting. Of course, slouching over a desk was not recommended either, as it revealed a reduction in spinal disk height, signifying a high rate of wear and tear on the lowest two spinal levels. 　
 “As to what is the best angle between thigh and torso when seated, reclining at 135 degrees can make sitting more difficult as there is a tendency to slide off the seat: 120 degrees or less may be better,” Dr. Waseem Bashir of the Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging at the University of Alberta Hospital, Canada, who led the study, suggested.
