Beckham to start a Major League Soccer team in U.S.
Since former England Captain David Beckham left the Los Angeles Galaxy last December he has mulled over his next step not as a professional soccer player, but to run a Major League Soccer team in Miami.
 Beckham said that he decided to pursue the dream of owning a club in America and according to the Associated Press report on Oct. 30, he would pay around $25 million to start a team in Miami and now is waiting for an approval process.
 “Miami is one of those places ? there were a few others we looked at ? and I’m passionate about that and being an owner of a team is something I feel passionate about. It has to excite me, management and coaching ? I love coaching kids, my own kids and other kids,” he said.
 Yet ending his celebrated career was not easy. The former player conceded his difficulties with retirement. 
 “I had a moment a few months ago where I found it difficult to come to terms with not playing any more. A moment in Paris I was on the plane working on a new project and I suddenly felt that jump from being a footballer into business,” he said.
 There are now 19 MLS teams in America and the 20th team, New York City FC, is poised to debut in 2015 through a partnership between Premier League club Manchester City and the New York Yankees.
 The 38-year-old is also paired up with Simon Fuller, the “American Idol” creator to debut the team in three years. Beckham has sure solidified his superstar status in the U.S. with the Los Angeles Galaxy and his star power could help create a successful team there.
