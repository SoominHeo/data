Daejanggeum’ sequel to come out in 2015
Local TV network MBC announced on Oct. 18 that it planned to make a sequel to mega-hit drama series “Daejanggeum” with its possible release set for the first half of 2015.
 The popularity of “Daejanggeum” was enormous, and is largely attributed to the birth of the Korean Wave in and outside of Asia. Its lead actress Lee Young-ae has grown into an A-list star in the region and it also ignited global interest in Korea’s traditional cuisine.
 “We’re planning to make Daejanggeum Season 2,” Kim Jong-guk, president of MBC, said in his opening speech at a cultural content forum in Seoul. “We’ll push for the production in the first half of 2015 after a year of pre-production.” Kim said that he recently visited China’s Hunan TV for the cooperation on the new series. Hunan TV aired “Daejanggeum” first in 2005 and has shown its intention to purchase and invest in the sequel.
 “Daejanggeum,” the 2003-2004 drama series also known as “Jewel in the Palace” explores the life of an orphaned kitchen girl who later turns into the first female physician for the king in the Joseon Dynasty. The series was first broadcast in 2003 in Korea and garnered around 46.2 percent in viewership ratings. Since then, the series was exported to nearly 90 countries; it helped boost the popularity of Korean pop culture and cuisine all over the world.
 “I think the character’s success story after overcoming personal difficulties resonated with people across the world,” Kim remarked at the forum.
