Croatia -- land of islands, fortresses and waterfalls
Entertainer Lee Seung-gi set out for Croatia in early November to shoot tvN‘s special backpacking project “Sisters Over Flowers” along with four other actresses.
 Producer Na Young-suk, who is leading the film crew, said in an interview that he chose Croatia to introduce eastern Europe’s unique ambience.
 Now, let’s take a look at some of the country’s beautiful landscapes and cultural heritage.
 The country is bordered by Hungary to the north, Montenegro to the south, Slovenia to the northwest, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast. It is divided into 20 counties, and has continental and Mediterranean climates. The Adriatic Sea on its coast has more than 1,000 islands, offering breathtaking scenery.
 Ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world, Croatia has a good many splendid tourist attractions.
 One thing that you should not miss in the country is the medieval town in Dubrovnik, which is considered one of the 10 best medieval walled cities in the world. The town boasts many old buildings, the oldest arboretum in the world, and the third-oldest European pharmacy. Also in the bay of Dubrovnik, there is a wooded island called Lokrum where you can see a fortress, and a botanical garden.　
 Another landscape you should definitely go check is the waterfalls in the Plitvice Lakes National Park, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. A series of waterfalls, joined by 16 lakes, make up most of the national park’s landscape. You can also see deer, bears, wolves and rare bird species around the waterfalls. Meanwhile, you can also enjoy the changing colors of the 16 lakes; they range from azure and green to grey and blue depending on the quantity of minerals in the water and the angle of the sunlight.
