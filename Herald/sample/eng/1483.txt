Should children be allowed to go on a diet?
Yes-
 Nowadays, many school students eat high-calorie fast food on the way home from school. So it is obvious that more and more students are obese these days.
 So I think children can and should go on diets.
 Most people think dieting is going on a fast and working out painfully, but that is not the way. We can go on a diet by decreasing the amount of food that we eat and by playing sports with friends that we like, rather than going on a fast or working out painfully.
 And some people are ostracized by their friends if they get fat and eat too much. So students should try to decrease their extra weight early on, but because they can’t beat off the temptation of delicious food, they resort to going on a severe diet.
 So I think children can go on diet but using a proper approach. That is to pay attention to their weight, and control their body weight early on.
No-
 Recently, it was reported that Yoon-hoo, who was featured in the TV show “Dad! Where are you Going?” went on a diet after viewers made fun of him for being chubby. However, I think children in elementary, middle and high schools should not be recommended to go on a diet. 
 A lot of children and young adults these days consider themselves fat and go on a diet, even though their weight is perfectly okay. Going on a diet means eating fewer calories than the amount your body uses and I think kids do not need to diet this way. Unlike adults, children up to high school are still in their growth stage and need to take in lots of nutrients to grow properly by eating healthily.
 Also, children have minimal self control, and can develop eating disorders while on a diet. These can get as severe as anorexia or bulimia. These kinds of eating disorders do not allow the children get the nutrients their bodies need, and can sometimes mean they end up in the hospital. 
 For these reasons, I think children and young adults in their growth stage should not go on a diet.
