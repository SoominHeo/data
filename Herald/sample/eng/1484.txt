Koreans still struggling with English proficiency
In an unfortunate twist of fate, Korea has been listed 24th in a list of 60 countries ranked in terms of English proficiency, according to the Switzerland-based global English education company, Education First (EF).
 The news is sure to disappoint many parents, considering the nation dedicates a hefty amount of time and money to learning English.
 “Koreans have a high level of educational zeal, as seen by the fact that they spend an average of 20,000 hours between primary school and university learning English, including both school instruction time and private tutoring, but the nation’s English skills have seen little improvement in the past six years,” said Christopher McCormick, senior vice president of EF’s academic affairs, who visited Korea in an effort to clarify the survey’s results. 
According to the EF report, the problem with Korea and its low English proficiency score is that Koreans tend to “focus on memorization and grammar.” It pointed out that “students graduate with technical skills, but many lack the ability to communicate with others in English.”
 The report puts Korea in fifth place among Asian countries in terms of English proficiency, behind Malaysia, Singapore, India and Hong Kong. 
The latest survey is the third of its kind, based on data collected via the comprehensive English Proficiency Index exam available online for free. The test is designed to assess a test-taker’s grammar, vocabulary, reading and listening skills in English. In addition to ranking the 60 countries based on English proficiency, the recent report also included an analysis of English proficiency trends from 2007 to 2012 using test data gathered over those six years from more than 5 million adults.
