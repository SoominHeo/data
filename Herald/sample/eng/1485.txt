Polio outbreak rattles Syria
Syria’s continuing war has ignited the country’s health crisis as confrontation between the government and the opposition group prevents medical aid from reaching its children, who are suffering from the first polio outbreak in 14 years. 
 Anthony Lake, executive director of United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) confirmed at a press conference at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland on Oct. 29 that 10 polio cases had been reported in northeast Syria, the first outbreak of the highly infectious disease since 1999. 
 Polio is a contagious disease that can cause paralysis. Efforts by UNICEF and the WHO to immunize 2.4 million children have been thwarted by warring sides in the country.
 “It’s very sad to see these young children suffering,” said Dr. Iman Bahnasi, Head of Health for UNICEF Syria. “If we want to control the outbreak, the campaign should be very short and very wide but the real problem we’re facing is we don’t have access to all the high-risk areas.” 
 “Syria is responsible for every child,” declared Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad. “We want vaccinations to reach every Syrian child wherever they are - either in a conflict zone or an area where the Syrian army is present.” 
 The U.N. has warned that half a million Syrian children, no matter where they live, must be urgently vaccinated against the disease. If not, the disease could be transported to neighboring countries with millions of Syrians who flee for their lives. 
 “Any single case of polio is a worry for the whole world, especially in a conflict area where neighboring countries also have weak immunization programs,” explained Dr. Salah Haithami, the World Health Organization’s polio medical officer.
