India sends first space mission to Mars
India launched its first spacecraft to Mars on Nov. 5.
 Hundreds of people watched the rocket carrying the Mars spacecraft take off from the east-coast island of Shriharikota, according to AP news.
 The orbiter, which weighs 1,350 kilograms, is named Mangalyaan, which means “Mars craft” in Hindi.
 AP news said that the spacecraft must travel 780 kilometers over 300 days to reach an orbit around the red planet next September.
 An Indian scientist said to AP news on Nov. 5 that the biggest challenge the orbiter faces is to precisely navigate the spacecraft to Mars. He said whether the launch is successful or not will be confirmed on Sept. 24, 2014.
 India will follow the precedents of the former Soviet Union, the United States and Europe in sending the space mission to Mars.
 The orbiter will carry sensors to gauge the Martian atmosphere and detect traces of methane which can prove the existence of live form of any sort, AFP explained on Nov. 4.
 “Any interplanetary probe is complex. As we can see for Mars, there were 51 missions so far around the world and there were 21 successful missions,” chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, K. Radhakrishnan, told AFP.
