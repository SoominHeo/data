Kim Yu-na gears up for Sochi Olympics
Getting ready for the Sochi Winter Olympics Games in February, Korean Olympic figure skating champion Kim Yu-na is taking part in a minor skating competition in Croatia next month, her agency All That Sports said.
 Kim is set to compete at the Golden Spin of Zagreb from Dec. 5-8 in Zagreb, Croatia - her first international competition this season before the upcoming Olympic Games in Russia early next year.
 Kim suffered from a foot injury in September this year and had to skip an International Skating Union Grand Prix event in October. But in a recent press conference the Olympic champion ensured her devoted fans that she is about “70 percent fit” and that she will enter minor events in order to put her Olympic preparations back on track. “I have recovered to a point where I have begun considering competing at an event before the Olympics,” Kim said. “I will prepare the best I can until the Olympics and bring home a good result.”
 In Croatia next month, Kim will unveil her new programs for the first time. She will perform her short program to “Send in the Clowns,” a ballad composed by Stephen Sondehim for the 1973 musical, “A Little Night Music.” Her free skate program will be choreographed to “Adios Nonino,” written by Argentine tango composer Astor Piazzolla in 1959.
 Kim won her first Olympic gold at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games and in Sochi, which will be her last Olympics, she will lay out her utmost efforts to defend her prestigious title.
