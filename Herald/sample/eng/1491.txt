8th London Korean Film Festival
The annual London Korean Film Festival, which has confirmed its status as the world’s largest film festival exclusively featuring Korean films, raised its curtain on Nov. 7 with the premiere of “Hide and Seek,” a suspense thriller that was an unexpected box-office hit in Korea. 
 It is a pleasant sign for the novice Huh Jung, who directed the film, as he is expected to follow the footsteps of numerous other Korean directors who have been successful overseas, such as Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho, Kim Ki-duk and Lee Chang-dong, who also served as Korea’s Culture Minister from 2003 to 2004 and is famous for acclaimed pieces such as “Poetry” (2010), “Oasis” (2002), “Peppermint Candy” (2000) and “Green Fish” (1997).
 About 40 films have been scheduled to be screened during the 2013 London Korean Film Festival, which runs from Nov. 7 to 22 at various venues in London including London’s cinema hotspot, Leicester Square.
 The lineup includes many of this year’s box-office hits including Kim Seong-woo’s disaster thriller “The Flu,” Jang Cheol-soo’s comedy-drama “Secretly, Greatly,” Song Hae-sung’s family drama “Boomerang Family,” director Kang Woo-suk’s “Fist of Legend,” and Lee Jun-ik’s “Wish.”
 Director Song Hae-sung’s “Boomerang Family,” starring actress Yoon Yeo-jung and Park Hae-il will be the festival’s closing piece, with its screen date set for Nov. 15 at the West End Theater. 
 “Hide and Seek” director Huh Jung and actor Son Hyun-joo, who plays the film’s main character, arrived in London on Nov. 7 for a special Q&A session. Other special guests include director Song Hae-sung, Kang Woo-suk, Kim Jee-woon, Hug-jung, Kim Sung-soo, actor Sol Kyung-gu, Park Hae-il, and actress Yoon Yeo-jung.
