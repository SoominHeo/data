Harvard University faces money problem
Harvard University, the world’s top Ivy League institution, has seen its deficit rise fourfold in the 2013 fiscal year to $34 million compared to $7.9 million last year, according to CNN Money News report.
 The economic shortfall is due partially to the federal budget cuts on research grants by the U.S. government while the university’s operating expenses, such as salaries, wages and benefits have increased at the same time, the report explained. 
 Harvard takes about a fifth of revenue from student tuition and it isn’t the only top-tiered school with a money problem. Its archrival, Yale University, has also witnessed its deficit rise to $39 million, the report said.
 “Colleges and universities around the country continue to face substantial pressure, and Harvard is no exception,” Harvard’s chief financial officer Daniel Shore and Treasurer James Rothenberg stated in a university report. Yet the deficit is “manageable” as it’s less than 1 percent of the school’s revenue, which totaled $4.2 billion, he insisted. 
 Still, Harvard University conceded that it will face “increasingly complicated yet unavoidable choices” to tackle its deficits in coming years. Though it didn’t specify how it would carry out deficit shrinking measures, it said it might reduce its benefits -- possibly the scholarship programs it gives out to students. These changes will be felt at a “personal level,” but they are inevitable and necessary, the university report argued.　
 Yet every cloud has a silver lining: Despite its economic hurdles, donations to the elite school continue to grow -- increasing 17 percent in the latest year to $339 million, transfusing much needed financial help to keep it running.
