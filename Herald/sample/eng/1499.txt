Depression makes us older
Depression can make people physically older by speeding up the aging process in their cells, a study in Molecular Psychiatry has found.
 Scientists have long suggested that people who suffer from major depression have an increased risk of age-related diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, obesity and heart disease. Unhealthy lifestyles and behavior, such as drinking alcohol and physical inactivity, were regarded as the main causes of these diseases. However, recent lab tests suspect that depression itself takes its own toll on people’s cells -- with cells in people who had been severely depressed in the past looking biologically older than others. 
 To delve deep into depression’s effects on aging, Josine Verhoeven from the VU University Medical Centre in the Netherlands carried out a test on 2,407 volunteers. More than one-third of those volunteers were currently depressed, a third had experienced major depression in the past and the rest had never been depressed. Their blood samples were analyzed for signs of cellular aging. Researchers looked into changes in structures in their cells called telomeres. Telomeres help prevent unwanted loss of vital genetic code in human cells. When cells divide, the telomeres get shorter so the length of telomeres is a way of evaluating cell aging.
 According to the study, people who were or had been depressed had much shorter telomeres than those who had never experienced depression. The most severely and chronically depressed patients had the shortest telomeres. 
 Dr. Verhoeven speculated that shortened telomeres are a result of the body’s reaction to depression. 
 “This large-scale study provides convincing evidence that depression is associated with several years of biological aging, especially among those with the most severe and chronic symptoms,” Verhoeven explained.
