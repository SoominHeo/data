Time names Lydia Ko one of world’s most influential teenagers
Lydia Ko, a 17-year-old Korean-born New Zealand golfer made Time magazine’s 2013 list of the world’s 16 most influential teenagers.
 The U.S. magazine released the list on its website and Ko was mentioned second after fellow New Zealander, 17-year-old singer Lorde who recently topped the Billboard single chart. Yet, the list’s order of influence was not stated.
 “She turned pro this year -- the LPGA waived the age requirement for her to join -- and she’s already fifth in the women’s world rankings,” the magazine said. “She’s the youngest person ever to win a professional golf tour event and the youngest person ever to win an LPGA tour event (and the only amateur to ever win two LPGA tour events).”
 As an amateur, Ko never missed a cut in 25 professional tournaments. She played seven majors starting with the 2012 U.S. Open and her best result in the LPGA majors is second place in the 2013 Evian Championships. 
 Beside Ko there was only one other young athlete who made the list: 18-year-old American competition swimmer Missy Franklin. Franklin won a whopping six gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. With her record-setting feat, she became the fifth swimmer to capture six or more gold medals at the Olympics and took home this year’s Women’s Sports Foundation’s Sportswoman of the Year award.
 Others on the list of 16 teenagers include American singer Justin Bieber, 19; Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani activist who was shot in the head by Taliban for promoting girls’ education and Malia Obama, 15, the daughter of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
