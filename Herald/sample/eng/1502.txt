Super Junior gives special lecture at Oxford
Korea’s 13-member boy band Super Junior has recently been all over the world for their world tour, “Super Show 5,” which began March of this year. 
 In the month of November, the band was in London, England and four members of the group -- Eun-hyuk, Kyu-hyun, Kang-in and Si-won -- delivered a special lecture to 400 students in the Oxford Union Debating Chamber at Oxford University, according to the group’s agency, S.M. Entertainment. 
 The title of the lecture was “Super Junior: The Last Man Standing.” The event was co-hosted by Oxford University Korea Society (OUKS), Oxford University Asia-Pacific Society (OUAPS), and the Oxford Union. 　
 At the venue, the “Fabulous Four” presented video highlights from their “Super Show” concert series which has attracted more than 1 million concert-goers around the world since the first show in 2008. They also talked about their albums, the training period to become a singer, music making processes and shared their thoughts on the hallyu, the undisputable global popularity of Korean pop culture -- mainly of Korean TV dramas, pop songs and films. They also gave dance lessons for their hit single “Sorry Sorry.” 　
 “We never even imagined we would have a lecture at the prestigious Oxford University, but we are happy we got such a great opportunity. We thank the students who listened attentively throughout the lecture and gave an enthusiastic response. While preparing for our lecture, we felt like we were given time to look back on our past activities so it was significant to us,” the four commented after answering various questions from the audience.
 “Super Show 5” is the live concert tour of Super Junior to support their sixth studio album, “Sexy, Free & Single.” The world tour started with two shows in Seoul in March 2013. After the show in London, the band left for Japan for its next performance in Osaka’s Kyocera Dome on Nov. 15-16.
