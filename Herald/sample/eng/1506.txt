China to relax one child policy
The Chinese government has announced that it plans to loosen the country’s notorious population restriction measure -- the “one child policy” -- according to a BBC report. 
 The Communist nation has been permitting only one child for each household in mainland China, except for families in countryside whose first child is a girl or is disabled, ethnic minority families and families where both parents are only children. They were exceptionally allowed to have two children. 
 Yet Beijing has announced this month that it will reform the one child policy to allow families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child. 
 The policy was introduced at the end of the 1970s in an effort to put a cap on its rapid population growth. Demographers point out that the measure prevented 200 million new births between 1979 and 2009 in the country. Yet, statistics show due to the policy, more than a quarter of the Chinese population will be over 65 by 2050. Also, the extreme manner the policy was implemented has come under fire. It ended up raising the number of forced abortions, female infanticide, and underreporting of female births in the country, as well as giving birth to the nation’s grave gender imbalance.
 Experts predict that regions with lower birth rates such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and the northeastern provinces are likely to switch to the new policy next year.
 “This is a positive measure that will not only deal with the demographic dividend decline, labor shortages and other issues, but also help to build a strong social security and pension system,” the Beijing Times forecast.
