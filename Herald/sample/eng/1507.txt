Korea finds trove of colonization records in embassy
The Seoul government unveiled some 67 sets of documents detailing the atrocities that took place during Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule, including a list of nearly 230,000 Koreans who were massacred and or sent into forced labor.
 The dusty records were discovered in Tokyo when the Korean Embassy underwent renovations in June 2013. The records shed new light on the number of people killed during the March 1 Independence Movement in 1919 and the number of Koreans who were mobilized for forced labor. 
Due to a lack of information about the past, the number of people killed during the March 1 Movement was officially declared at 391. One of the 67 recently discovered record books, however, showed that 630 people were killed on that fateful day, while another identified 290 Koreans who were allegedly slaughtered after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. The rest of the documents are said to carry the names of 229,781 conscripted Koreans, forced to work during Japanese colonial rule. 
Experts say that the discovery of the rosters will now play a crucial role in the negotiations with Japan for an apology and compensation for the victims. 
National Archives of Korea chief Park Gyeong-guk told the media during the documents’ unveiling that the lists were compiled from nationwide surveys conducted in 1953 under the direction of then-President Syngman Rhee, and that they include such details as the victims’ addresses and dates of birth.
 The government plans to use the lists to back up its demands for Japan to acknowledge what happened in the past. The documents will be put on public display in early 2014.
