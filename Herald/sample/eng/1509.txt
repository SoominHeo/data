Cheap apples, pricey eggs
National logistics and farming industries said that the price of apples was tumbling, while that of eggs was skyrocketing as of late November.
 A good harvest in the fall and an unprecedented heat wave in summer are the main reasons for the contrasting prices of each crop, they said.
 According to Seoul Agro-fisheries & Food Corporation, the average price of apples dropped by around 16 percent during the first 18 days of November, when compared to the same period last year.
 The main contributor to the fall in price was the typhoon-free summer this year, agriculture experts said.
 Meanwhile, the price of eggs soared by about 50 percent in November from the previous year, a national poultry farming association said.
 The number of chickens bred in Korea in early November stands around 60 million, experts say, but 2 million birds perished this summer in the nationâ€™s worst-ever heat wave.
 Experts also explained that customers were avoiding marine products, concerned about the nuclear accident in Japan, and instead were purchasing eggs as a substitute.
 National Agricultural Cooperative Federation predicted that the high egg prices would not ease until early next year.
