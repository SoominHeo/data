National soccer team ready for Brazil World Cup
Despite an aching loss at this year’s last friendly against Russia on Nov. 19, the country’s national soccer team seems to be on the right path to prepare for the World Cup in Brazil next year. 
 In its latest game in Dubai, Korea was defeated 2-1 by Russia. But the match cemented the fact that the Korean team is on its right track to next year’s World Cup under the new leadership of Hong Myung-bo, the soccer player-turned coach of South Korea. Hong replaced former coach Choi Kang-hee in June this year. 
 Hong helped the national soccer team polish its skills to the point that it could garner three victories, four losses, three draws with 12 goals scored and 11 allowed up to date. Three losses came against Croatia, Brazil and Russia, all regarded as international powerhouses in the sport. And its two consecutive wins against Mali and Switzerland in Seoul were nothing but reassuring. 
 The game against Switzerland was a complete confidence-booster. The 2-1 victory over the world No. 7, Switzerland, may be the best game Korea has played under coach Hong.
 Striker Kim Shin-wook managed to showcase his versatility, delivering his finest international performance. He also scored the opening goal against Russia, becoming the first front-line striker to score under Hong’s leadership.
 As the country is scheduled to play three friendly matches in the United States early next year, the team is more hopeful than ever for its prospects in the 2014 Brazil World Cup.
