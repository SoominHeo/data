IU & Jang Keun-suk to star in ‘Pretty Boy’
Versatile young singer IU is returning to TV drama scene shortly after the release of her third full-length album, “Modern Times,” the Korea Herald reports. And actor Jang Keun-suk has been chosen for the main male role of KBS’ “Pretty Boy” to star alongside IU.
 “IU is like a veteran actress who has been honing her craft for years,” Jang said of his co-star IU. 
 IU had her first lead acting debut on KBS drama “You’re the Best, Lee Soon-shin,” which ended in August this year. She was chosen to play the drama’s leading role in “Pretty Boy” while promoting her new album. 
 “We decided to cast IU as she has a cute and friendly image, which is the perfect fit for the character in this drama,” said a KBS spokesperson. With her new role in the drama, she has to prove that she is capable of juggling two things at a time – promoting her new single while acting. “I felt I could do both,” ambitious singer-actress said. “I was into the second week of activities for my new album when I received the synopsis, and it was great fun to read.”
 Asked about his reason to come back to TV drama, 26-year-old actor Jang Keun-suk who is sensationally popular in Japan said that he wanted to reestablish himself as an actor. 
 “I felt lonely while on stage, and I felt that perhaps other things such as acting have become the mainstay of my life,” he said. 
 The new drama is based on a cartoon of the same name that tells a story about a jaw droppingly handsome man named Dokgo (played by Jang Keun-suk) learning lessons about women.
 IU’s character, Kim Bo-tong, is described as an ordinary girl -- as the name (Botong) signifies her personality -- but has had a romantic crush on Dokgo since middle school. Botong tries to win over Dokgo’s heart and drives away many women who pursue his affections along the way.
