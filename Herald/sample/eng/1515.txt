Germany sees surge in Asian travelers
Asian travelers are contributing significantly to the rise in foreign visitors in Germany, the German National Tourist Office said in its recent report.
 The report detailing the demographics of incoming tourists to Germany revealed that the number of nights spent by Asian travelers was rising, with Chinese travelers taking up the largest share, followed by Koreans.
 According to the report, Asian tourists were the second-largest tourist group to Germany, making up around 10 percent of total travelers, while Europeans accounted for about 75 percent. 
 Germany saw a great increase in the number of nights spent by Koreans in 2012 with 425,530, a 22.1 percent rise from 2011. 
 “We aim to reach more than 600,000 overnight stays by Koreans in 2020. We see a great potential in the growth of Korean travelers to Germany,” said Petra Hedorfer, CEO of the German National Tourist Board. 
 Germany has been the No. 2 European destination for Koreans: 44 percent of them visit the country for leisure and holidays and 49 percent visit for business trips. 　
 The German tourist board has announced travel campaigns for year 2014 as it aims to appeal to travelers from around the world. 
 “The UNESCO World Heritage Sites are crucial elements that draw foreign tourists to Germany. The purpose of 34 percent of cultural tourism in Germany is to visit the heritage sites,” explained Hedorfer. 
 Germany has 38 of the world’s 962 registered UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ranging from historical buildings and cathedrals to natural landscape and even whole towns. 
 Meanwhile, Bergpark Wilhelmshhe joined the list of cultural sites in July 2013. The grand hillside park was recognized for its unique blend of landscape design from both the Baroque and Romantic periods.
