Iran promises partial nuclear deal
Six world powers -- the U.S., U.K., France, Russia, China and Germany -- took part in talks with Iran on Tehran’s alleged peaceful nuclear program and struck a six-month interim deal in Geneva on Nov. 24, in which Iran is expected to curb some of its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. 
 During the talks hosted by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and EU envoy Ashton were at the helm of the first partial nuclear agreement in more than a decade, BBC reported. 
 The U.S. President Barack Obama voiced support for the temporary agreement saying: “Huge challenges remain, but we cannot close the door on diplomacy, and we cannot rule out peaceful solutions to the world’s problems. We cannot commit ourselves to an endless cycle of violence.”
 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius remarked that a raft of EU sanctions on Iran might be lifted as early as next month and Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional rival, cautiously welcomed the deal in a statement: “This agreement could be a first step toward a comprehensive solution for Iran’s nuclear program, if there are good intentions.”　
 Under the deal, which will last six months, Iran will receive some $7 billion in “limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible (sanctions) relief” and sanctions will be suspended. Iran is the world’s fourth-largest oil producer.　
 In return, Tehran must follow through on its promises, such as putting a brake on uranium enrichment beyond 5 percent and offering inspectors greater access to key nuclear sites.
 President Hassan Rouhani, who replaced the hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in August as the country’s president, has vehemently insisted that his country does not seek to build nuclear weapons. Yet, West has long speculated that Iran’s uranium enrichment program is geared toward producing weapons.
