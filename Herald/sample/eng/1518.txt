China’s new air zone raises tension in Northeast Asia region
China’s newly imposed air defense identification zone (ADIZ) has escalated tensions between China, Japan and Korea because of its overlap with Ieodo and a set of islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Daioyu in China. 
Internationally known as Socotra Rock, Ieodo has been a source of tension between Korea and China for a long time because of its location within the overlapping exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the two countries. Both claim sovereignty over the waters around Ieodo. 
Referring to a group of underwater reefs located 149 kilometers southwest of Korea’s southernmost Marado Island, Ieodo cannot be the subject of a territorial dispute under U.N. maritime law. However, this has done nothing to prevent both sides from claiming sovereignty over the waters of Ieodo. 
Seoul and Beijing have had several negotiations regarding the EEZ overlap and Ieodo, but no clear agreement has been reached. The dispute was rekindled when China unilaterally incorporated Ieodo in its ADIZ.
 During the third annual Korea-China strategic defense dialogue on Nov. 28, the two nations were unable to reach an amicable settlement over the ADIZ, with China refusing to accept Korea’s demand to adjust the demarcation lines of its newly established ADIZ in the East China Sea.　
 China’s establishment of the zone “is a potentially destabilizing unilateral action designed to change the status quo in the region, and raises the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation,” U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned on Nov. 27. 
Not only has the new ADIZ raised tensions between Korea and China, diplomatic ties between China and Japan have also been strained by the ADIZ’s inclusion of a set of islands whose sovereignty continues to be disputed between the two nations.
