Vettel crowned 2013 Formula One champion
Sebastian Vettel of Germany has emerged as 2013 Formula One champion following his year-end race win in the Brazilian Grand Prix on Nov. 24.
 Vettel of Red Bull was initially overtaken by Nico Rosberg of Mercedes at the beginning of the Brazilian race but regained the lead on his second lap and sailed smoothly through to record his second victory in Brazil, as well as his 39th career win. Vettel crossed the line 10.4 seconds faster than his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. Fernando Alonso of Ferrari was third. 
 Sebastian Vettel, a 26-year-old German driver, won 13 out of 19 races around the world during this year’s Formula One season, matching the record of legendary German racing driver Michael Schumacher’s 13 victories in a year. Vettel also equaled the nine consecutive wins recorded by Alberto Ascari of Italy, another notable racing driver and twice Formula One World Champion.
 2013 was a remarkable year for Vettel because not only did he break Schumacher’s 2004 record of seven straight wins in a year at the U.S. Grand Prix, but he also became the youngest driver to win four world championships. His Red Bull team also won the title of 2013 Formula One winning team.
 “I think it is very difficult for me to realize, probably now and in the next couple of weeks, what we have achieved again, and in particular this year at the end of the season,” Vettel said. “I’m actually quite sad that this season comes to an end. The car has been phenomenal. It just kept getting better. I’m extremely proud.”
