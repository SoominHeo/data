‘Sisters over Flowers’ to showcase actresses’ feminine charm
Cable channel tvN’s newest reality program, “Sisters over Flowers,” part of the series “Backpacking Project, Part 2,” was aired for the first time on Nov. 29. 
 The program will have a different vibe to “Grandpas over Flowers,” which followed the antics of four veteran actors backpacking throughout Europe and Taiwan. 
 “‘Sisters over Flowers’ is going to be completely different from ‘Grandpas over Flowers,’” head producer of the series Nah Young-suk said at a press conference held in Sinchon, Seoul, on Nov. 26.
 “When we walked down a market street with the grandpas, they would look straight ahead and walk toward their destination. The actresses, on the other hand, were very curious about all the different items sold at the market and would stop at each shop.” 　
 While “Grandpas over Flowers” featured a cast of all-male actors: Shin Goo, Park Geun-hyung, Baek Il-seob and Lee Soon-jae, the new installment features veteran actresses Yoon Yeo-jeong, Kim Ja-ok, Kim Hee-ae and Lee Mi-yeon. 
 The first series was filmed in various well-traveled locations, such as France, Switzerland and Taiwan. The actresses, on the other hand, are going to more unique locations, starting out in Istanbul, Turkey, and moving on to their main destination in Eastern Europe, Croatia. 
 “Compared to the grandpas, the actresses had 5,000 times more emotional responses to their surroundings. They were more talkative, and were very expressive, whether they were surprised, happy or sad,” producer Na said. 
Actor Lee Seo-jin, fluent in English and apt at reading maps, served as a guide for the first series and was replaced by singer and actor Lee Seung-gi in the second.
