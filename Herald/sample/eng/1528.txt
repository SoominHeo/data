China pulls off moon rover mission
A rocket carrying the Chang’e-3 probe was successfully blasted off from China’s Xichang Satellite Launch Center, southwest of China on Dec. 1, carrying the country’s first robotic lunar rover, Reuters reported.
 Its robotic rover, Jade Rabbit, is scheduled to roam across the Bay of Rainbows, a basaltic plain formed from lava that filled a crater, around Dec. 14 and will send back data and pictures to Earth, the report predicted.
 If it is successfully pulled off, the Chang’e-3 mission will be China’s first “soft landing” on the moon and the first by any country since 1976, when the Soviet Union sent a probe. The United States was the first to complete an unmanned expedition on the moon’s surface in 1972. 
 “China’s getting a lot of prestige, which turns into geostrategic influence, from the fact that they are the third country to have manned spaceflight capabilities, that they are going to the moon,” Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the United States Naval War College in Rhode Island who researches China’s space activities noted.
 This mission will help China raise its patriotic pride and enhance its science, satellite and military sectors. But the news concerned the West as the technology used in the space program can be transferred to the development of missiles, the report pointed out.
 China began space exploration in 1970 and in 2003, China sent its first astronaut into space. 
 The Chang’e lunar exploration program, named after a moon goddess, began in 2007. Cheng’e-2 mission launched in 2010 and it sent back more detailed images of the moon.
 The latest solar-powered, six-wheeled rover Chang’e-3 mission will spend three months exploring the moon and collecting data.
