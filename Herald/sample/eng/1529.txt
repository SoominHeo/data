Daegu University students develop multi-purpose navigation system for bikes
Students at Daegu University have successfully developed a navigation system for bikes that also provides information on atmospheric pollution levels for a more enjoyable experience.
 The “Smart Bicycle” navigation system is designed to provide the rider with the option of avoiding areas with high levels of pollution for a safer, more enjoyable ride by informing them of the level of toxic substances in the air along with directions to their destinations. It was developed by three students majoring in embedded systems engineering at Daegu University: Cho Joong-jae, 24, Bae Sang-won, 26, and Han Moon-hyun, 24. 
The system works by gathering information on pollution levels through a sensor that is attached to the bicycle and connected to a smartphone. The sensor measures the level of carbon dioxide, dust and other harmful substances in the air, transmitting the relevant information to the smartphone. The information is accumulated on a server, which is then used by the system to warn riders of areas with high levels of air pollution. 
In addition, the system uses power generated from the sun’s rays and pedaling to keep the smartphone charged, thereby reducing the loss of battery power. The system also provides information on how many calories were burned during the ride, a function that allows riders to track the results of their workout. 
“We developed this system because despite the fact that there has been an increase in the number of people riding bikes for their health, there are also a lot of people who are uneasy about air pollution like yellow dust,” said Cho, adding that “we hope this system can be of some help in providing people with a sense of ease about riding bikes.”
