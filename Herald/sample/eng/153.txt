Foreign tourists infatuated by Seoul’s food
Foreign visitors picked food as the Seoul’s biggest attraction whereas locals chose the Han River its biggest charm, a survey showed on Oct. 12. 
The Seoul Metropolitan Government asked 3,827 Korean and foreign residents living in Seoul from Aug. 10 to 28.
 Seoul’s “diverse and delicious foods,” was followed by its “comfortable mass transit system” and “people who are kind and warmhearted.” Among all the Korean food, foreigners gave top marks to Korean barbecued beef, or “galbi.” 
 On the same survey, Korean people named the Han River as their favorite because it serves as the perfect place for weekend leisure activities.
 A city official said that they will use these survey results in developing Korea’s future tourist programs.
