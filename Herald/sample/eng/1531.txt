Shinhan reaches out to the underprivileged
Shinhan Financial Group launched its year-end charity program in Seoul on Dec. 3 for the underprivileged, including senior citizens living alone, disabled people and day workers.
 The program started at DongShin Church in Jongno-gu, and the group’s chairman Han Dong-woo delivered a 230 million won ($210,000) donation to the Commander of the Korean Salvation Army Park Jong-deok, for the benefit of the neglected people.
 The donation will be used to provide the needy in the areas around Seoul Station, Namdaemun, Jongno, Dongdaemun and Yeongdeungpo with winter necessities, such as gloves, muffler, winter cap, socks, blanket and sleeping bags.
 The inauguration event where about 150 Shinhan group employees participated in started with wrapping of the gift sets early in the morning, followed by free lunch service for the people living in Dongdaemun area.
 This charity event is one of Shinhan group’s biggest charitable activities, and this year in particular replaced the usual year-end party for the group executives, said Shinhan officials. The students who are enrolled in the programs offered by the Shinhan Scholarship Foundation also took part in the volunteering activity.
 Han said Shinhan and its employees wanted to provide assistance for those who are alienated from social support when winter makes their lives more difficult. He added that Shinhan would continue to do its best to fulfill its social responsibility for local citizens.
 Shinhan Financial Group has engaged in a variety of charity projects since 2008, and this year the group’s affiliated companies - Shinhan Bank, Shinhan Card and Shinhan Life Insurance - also plan to carry out their own volunteering activities for the underprivileged before the end of this year, group officials said.
