Hazardous fine dust
Health authorities are on alert over recently heightened levels of fine particles in the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other irritations in the eye, nose and throat.
 About 30 times smaller than a human hair, ultrafine particles less than 2.5 micrometers across can be carried by the wind from as far away as China.
 Recent studies showed the particles can directly enter the bronchial tubes and interfere with the gas exchange in the lungs.
 This should be especially alarming to those who have weak respiratory and circulatory systems, and others who are vulnerable to viruses, Lim Young-wook, assistant director of the Institute for Environmental Research at Yonsei University’s College of Medicine recently told The Korea Herald.
 Lim explained in the interview that the fine dust seen today is different from yellow dust. According to Lim, fine dust is produced through industrial development and carries significant amounts of metals, such as lead, cadmium and copper.　
 The accumulation of such pollutants can lead to cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and even psychological diseases such as severe depression.
 Dr. John G. Spangler, a professor of family medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre, revealed this year that suicide rates in counties where coal-fired power plants operate were higher than elsewhere, suggesting that the quality of air can affect people suffering from different mood disorders, according to The Korea Herald.　
 Meanwhile, Lim said that the danger of fine dust would likely get more severe, as Chinese cities are firing up their coal-fired heating systems over the winter.
 To deal with the environmental problems, the government announced that it would begin nationwide fine dust forecasts next February. 
The system will provide information on air quality affected by fine dust ― particles smaller than 10 micrometers per cubic meter ― on a scale of 1 to 5.
