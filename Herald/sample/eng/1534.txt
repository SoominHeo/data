Korea to capitalize on technology in developing sports industry
The Korean government has vowed to develop the national sports industry by taking advantage of its high-end technology.
 In a five-year plan, Seoul is striving to turn the nation’s sports industry into a growth engine, according to a Yonhap News report.
 Under this ambitious plan, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is looking at expanding the size of its sports business from 3.7 trillion won ($3.5 billion) today to up to 5.3 trillion won by 2018 through combining advanced information and scientific technologies with sports.
 At a press conference, Kim Chong, the vice minister of culture, sports and tourism, remarked that the government would help raise sports-related jobs from 230,000 this year to 270,000 by 2018. 
 According to Kim, the ministry will also build an open platform for sports- and health-related information, called the Sports Activity Index. He said that people can share sports information with others utilizing the index through their mobile devices as well as keeping track of their exercise routines.　
 There will be more interactive sports simulators to be built for popular sports such as baseball and football so that it will provide more opportunities for people to enjoy outdoor sports indoors. This will help the government maximize the sports industry’s market potential by making sports facilities more accessible and offering consumers more diverse content, the vice minister said.
