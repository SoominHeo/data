Nanga Parbat, mountaineers' ambition
Nanga Parbat is a 2010 German mountaineering movie about two brothers, Reinhold and Gunther Messner, who climbed Nanga Parbat.
 The film is based on his tell-all story of Reinhold Messener, a legendary mountaineer who was the first to conquer the 14 highest summits in the world. He talks about his first conquer of the Nanga Parbat and the tragedy where he lost his brother Gunther on a Nanga Parbat expedition they together took in 1970.
 Nanga Parbat had not been climbed by anyone before Messener, and climbing it was German mountaineers’ biggest ambition at the time. 
 Nanga Parbat is the ninth-highest mountain in the western anchor of the Himalayas. It lies just south of the Indus River in the Diamer District of Gilgit–Baltistan in Pakistan, not far from the northwestern end of the Karakoram range. It is locally known as “Deo Mir.” 
 Nanga Parbat is an eight-thousander – a name for a mountain that has a summit more than 8,000 meters high; it stands at 8,126 meters. It also has an immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain. Thus, it is an extremely difficult peak to climb even for skilled climbers. Many lost their lives in the hope of conquering the summit and numerous deaths in the early and mid-20th century gave it the nickname “killer mountain.”
 The film contains spectacular snow-covered mountain scenery and thrilling mountain-climbing sequences. Exotic scenes of Himalayan locales are bound to thrill viewers. 
 The film opened in cinemas nationwide on Dec. 12.
