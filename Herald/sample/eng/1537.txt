CNN picks Seoul as 12th best city for shopping
Of all the beautiful and exciting cities around the world, Seoul was picked as one of the 12 best cities for shopping by CNN.
 In time for the holiday season, CNN recently posted a list on its website detailing which cities around the world deliver the most gratifying and enjoyable shopping experiences. Using a one to 10 scoring scale, the cities were judged based on four categories: getting around, value, variety and experience. 
Seoul scored 4 points in getting around, 7 in value, 4 in variety and 6 in experience for a total of 21 points, placing just behind Milan (22) and Madrid (23).
 “South Korea has a serious addiction to shopping. The most serious in the world, in fact,” CNN wrote in its report. “South Korea recorded more credit card transactions per person than any other country in 2011.” 
“The capital city is bursting with shops of a dizzying array of types and sizes from LED-fish-scale-studded luxury department stores to towering all-night shopping malls to trendy street carts, which all reflect the ever-changing hottest item of the moment,” it added. “While foreign luxury goods tend to get a hefty mark-up, local boutiques tend to be cheap and chic. The city has a good mix of the old and new.”
 As for CNN’s pick for best city to shop, New York City, a world-famous shopper’s mecca, topped the ranking with 35 points. 
“This town has so much diversity in style and interpretations of chic,” fashion editor and stylist Stella Lee was quoted as saying by CNN. 
“You can find pieces from every possible era spanning the entire last century of fashion history, and from a wide range of design houses including the likes of Galanos, Dior, Givenchy, Ungaro, Pierre Cardin, Ossie Clark, and more,” she added. 
The third-highest ranking was Tokyo with 34 points, followed by London (31), Kuala Lumpur (30), Paris (29), Hong Kong (28), Buenos Aires (27), Vienna (25), Dubai (24), Madrid and Milan.
