Sweden looks to create cashless society
The use of cash may soon become a thing of the past in one Nordic country, AFP reported. 
 In the Swedish capital Stockholm, the use of cash has plummeted and Swedes increasingly make their daily transactions with debit cards. 
 “I never carry cash around. No one does anymore,” one Swedish consumer told the news service.
 In recent years, only 27 percent of retail sales in Sweden are made with cash, a report by the European Central Bank shows. If online sales were included, the figure would even be smaller, it pointed out.
 This is a sharp contrast from other European nations such as Greece and Romania, where 95 percent of transactions were made via cash.
 Though it is unlikely that money will go completely virtual in the country, its gradual move to a cashless society will greatly change the way Swedes live. The policy will socially marginalize the elderly and rural citizens and make it even more difficult for small store owners to make profits, as they are bombarded with additional transaction fees for each purchase. Banks and card companies are the only big winners. 
“We’ll probably not see a totally cashless society in the near future, but a society where cash is reduced to a minimum and used in very few situations is probably quite realistic,” said Niklas Arvidsson, a researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. 
 Everything from ice cream to taxes will be paid with bank cards as neither retailers nor banks have any obligation to accept cash, says the nation’s central bank, the Riksbank.
 In the end, it all comes down to how wisely the people of Sweden will act as consumers with the changes they will face, the report concluded.
