Milk price hike stifled by the government
A news report revealed on Oct. 12 that Seoul Milk, the country’s biggest milk manufacturer, retracted the company’s initial plan to raise its milk price by 10 percent from Oct. 16.
 The report suggested that the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries might have forced the company to call off its move in fear of the ripple affect on other goods that use dairy products such as coffee, bread and baby formula.
 Korea’s three major dairy manufacturers -- Seoul, Maeil and Namyang -- reportedly postponed their milk price increase until the end of the year. 
 “We could not raise milk prices since the Aug. 16 agreement and we’ve been losing 250 million won every day,” an industry official said.
 Yonhap News stated that at the moment, the price for a liter of white milk is around 2,150 won and this would go up to around 2,370 won if a 10 percent price hike were imposed.
