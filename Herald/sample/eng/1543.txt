Science behind dog’s tail-wagging
Dogs express their feelings far more profoundly with the movement of their tails than previously thought, scientists have discovered.
 It was long believed by pet owners that the way a dog waves its tail was a form of self expression. But a recent study conducted by neuroscientists at the University of Trento, Italy, show that dogs communicate far more information about their feelings with their tail wagging.
 According to the study, dogs change their movement of their tails depending on how happy or sad they are. Dogs tend to move their tails to the right if they are happy and will move their tails slightly to the left when they are anxious and feel threatened ? in other words, if they are experiencing negative emotions. 
 These subtle changes in the movement is quite difficult to catch by their owners but researchers point out that dogs can pick up on these signals more acutely than humans.
 Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, who led the research at the Centre for Brain Sciences at the University of Trento, showed 43 dogs video footage of another dog wagging its tail or sitting still. He and his research team measured the animals’ heart rates and monitored their physical responses to look for signs of emotional response.
 The study showed that the dogs’ heart rates increased and showed signs of anxiety when they saw a strange dog with its tail wagging slightly to the left. In contrast, when they saw a dog whose tail wagged slightly to the right, they remained calm and had a relaxed heart rate. 
 “We know from neurological studies in humans that the left and right hemispheres in the brain produce different emotional responses. In dogs, single organs like the tongue or tail are controlled by both sides of the brain,” Professor Vallortigara said.
 “It seems dogs pick up on this when they meet other dogs and it forms a type of communication between them.”
