Korea wins bid to host 2017 FIFA U20 World Cup
Having won the right to host the 2017 FIFA U20 World Cup in Costa Do Sauipe, Brazil on Dec. 4, a day before the final draw for the 2014 World Cup, Korea will become the third country to host all four FIFA events in the world, after Japan and Mexico.　
 In a vote during FIFA’s Executive Committee meeting, Korea edged out Azerbaijan in the competition to host the world’s premier youth football tournament in 2017.
 The U20 World Cup will be the country’s fourth FIFA-sanctioned competition after the 2001 Confederations Cup; the 2002 World Cup, which it co-hosted with Japan; and the 2007 U17 World Cup. 
 Welcoming the result, Chung Mong-gyu, head of the KFA, who traveled overseas to seek support from FIFA officials and heads of national football federations said that hosting the 2017 youth soccer tournament shows Korea’s progress in sports diplomacy.
 “Since the 2002 World Cup, there have been concerns about Korea’s diminishing influence in football diplomacy. Hosting such a major event alone, 15 years after co-hosting the World Cup with Japan is meaningful.”
 Kim Chong, the vice minister of culture, sports and tourism said the U20 tournament would provide a boost to the nation’s sports industry. “We expect hosting this event to make a major impact not only on the football industry, but the entire sports industry,” he said.
 The U20 World Cup tournament began in 1977 and is held every two years. At the 2017 event, 24 countries are set to participate. The 2015 tournament will be held in New Zealand. Korea’s best performance at the tournament was fourth place in the 1983 competition in Mexico.
 Korea will compete in Group H with Belgium, Russia, Algeria in World Cup first round at upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Belgium stands at 11th in FIFA world rankings; Russia ranks at 22, Algeria is 26 and Korea ranks at 54th.
 The South Korean team, led by coach Hong Myung-bo, will begin its first Group H play on June 18 in Cuiaba against Russia. It will play against Algeria on June 23 in Porto Alegre and against Belgium on June 27th in Sao Paulo.
