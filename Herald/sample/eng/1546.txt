The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
Photo-editor Walter Mitty lives a plain life. So when he tries to write his profile at an online matchmaking site, hoping to find a girlfriend, he has nothing special to write down. He has done nothing interesting in his life, has a boring job and has not been to a place that would interest others. So he leaves those boxes empty.
 Instead, Walter Mitty spends a great portion of his time daydreaming -- in particular, heroic daydreaming where he turns into a superman-like hero, saving his girlfriend from fire, or into a climber who reaches a top of a mountain. According to his mom in the film, he “zones out” from time to time, dreaming. 
 But his publication company goes through job cuts, and he is told he will have to leave the company where he spent more than a decade. And now he has one last issue to complete. His former colleague, an extraordinary photographer played by actor Sean Penn, gives him a picture for the magazine’s last cover. But the photo is missing. Mitty tries to reach the photographer but is unable to do so because the photographer enjoys adventure and cannot be reached from where Mitty lives. Finally, Mitty embarks on an unimaginable adventure in search of that one last photo for the magazine. 
 He ends up fighting against a shark in the vast ocean, traveling to Greenland and then Iceland and jumping onto a flying helicopter, running into an erupting volcano and climbing the world’s roughest mountain. While doing so, he automatically earns plenty of interesting stories that he could share on his page at the matchmaking site. 
2013 Adventure comedy film “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” stars Ben Stiller as Mitty and Sean Penn as an amazing photographer. Filming also took place in Iceland. The film opens in theaters nationwide on Jan.1, 2014.
