The essence of Indonesia
For many travelers, Indonesia still remains one of the favorite destinations for a vacation, honeymoon or recreational holiday, mainly because of the burgeoning resort industry in Bali. 
 The world’s fourth-most populous country, with over 238 million people and an archipelago comprising about 17,508 islands, however, has recently begun promoting its cultural and historical legacy to travelers coming from around the world. For those planning on spending a winter vacation in Bali, try making a stop at Yogyakarta, a major Indonesian city that represents the country’s dynamic, rich and multi-faceted culture. 
 Yogyakarta is a gateway to Borobudur, one of the world’s greatest Buddhist monuments and considered by many as one of the modern-day Seven Wonders.
 Borobudur is a ninth-century Mahayana Buddhist Temple and is said to be the greatest Buddhist stupa. (A stupa is a mound filled with Buddhist relics.)
 The temple complex is not as large as Angkor Wat in Cambodia. But the monument is unquestionably magnificent when considering the fact that it was built before A.D. 800, presumably more than 300 years before the construction of the Angkor Wat temples began in A.D. 1113.
 Yogyakarta is also the center of traditional Indonesian art and the city of elite education. The city gives off an impression of youthfulness as there are tens of thousands of college students moving busily across the town. The city has many of Indonesia’s most prestigious universities and is the center of traditional arts and crafts.
