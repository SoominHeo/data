History of all language
Most linguists believe that all human languages originate from a single dialect spoken in East Africa around 50,000 years ago. 
A recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argues that this original language may have used a subject-object-verb word order, similar to the speech of Yoda, a tiny green Jedi from the Star Wars series. 
Co-author Merritt Ruhlen explained to Life’s Little Mysteries, a sister site to LiveScience that “This language would have been spoken by a small East African population who seemingly invented fully modern language and then spread around the world, replacing everyone else.” 
According to LiveScience, the researchers came to this conclusion after creating a language family tree to show the historical relationship between all the languages of the world.
