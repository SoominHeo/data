Movie ticket sales in Korea top 200 million in 2013
The total number of moviegoers in Korea this year hit the 200 million mark on Dec. 18, averaging out to four theater visits per person, according to the state-run Korean Film Council (KOFIC).
 Of the record number of tickets sold, Korean films attracted 118 million viewers, exceeding last year’s record of 115 million. In addition, Korean movies took up 59.1 percent of the market share in 2013. 
 This year’s numbers, reported by KOFIC prior to the start of the holiday season, mean that Korean cinema’s have sold the most tickets ever in a single year. 
 In addition to drawing a bigger audience, this year saw the release of English-language films by Korean filmmakers. 
 Director Bong Joon-ho’s sci-fi thriller “Snowpiercer,” for example, featured an international cast that included renowned British actress Tilda Swinton, Hollywood actor Ed Harris and leading Korean actor Song Kang-ho.
 The diversity in genre and style of this year’s Korean films also helped appeal to a wider audience. “The Face Reader” was a period drama about a man who studied physiognomy while “Miracle in Cell No. 7” was a heartwarming comedy about a wrongfully imprisoned mentally challenged man and his 6-year-old daughter. 
 Eight Korean films released in 2013, including “Miracle in Cell No. 7,” “Snowpiercer” and “The Face Reader,” are listed in the top 10 box office hits in Korea, drawing in more than 5 million viewers. By comparison, only three films -- “The Thieves,” “A Werewolf Boy” and “Masquerade” -- drew more than 5 million viewers in 2012. 
 Only two foreign films -- “Iron Man 3” and “World War Z” -- made it into the top 10 box office list.
"Iron Man 3” ranked fourth, attracting 9 million viewers, while “World War Z,” a zombie movie starring Brad Pitt, ranked 10th with 5.24 million audience members.
