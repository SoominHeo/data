Michelle Bachelet of Chile reclaims her presidency
Left-wing candidate Michelle Bachelet who led an alliance of her Socialist Party, Christian Democrats and Communists has been declared the new president of Chile -- her second since her first presidency from 2006 to 2010.
 Bachelet garnered 62 percent of votes against Evelyn Matthei’s 38 percent, a former minister from the country’s governing center-right coalition.
 She was highly popular when she stepped down as president in 2010, but could not seek a second consecutive term because Chile‘s constitution barred her from doing so. Now that she grabbed her second presidency, she has become the first leader in Chile to serve two terms since the military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. 
 She won the election by campaigning on policies of reducing the gap between rich and poor. Her core supporters were women, members of the gay and lesbian community and environmentalists. 　
 The second-time Chilean president wants to increase taxes to offer free university education to the younger generation of Chile and reform outdated political structures devised by the former dictator Gen. Pinochet. Her education reforms will be costly, eating up an extra 1.5 percent to 2 percent of gross domestic product each year, experts point out. However, Bachelet says she will collect money from taxes, particularly on big business. 
"I will carry out deep reforms needed in Chile. I am proud to be your president-elect today. I am proud of the country we’ve built but I am even more proud of the country we will build,” Bachelet, 62, said in her victory speech.
