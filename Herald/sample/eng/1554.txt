Million-dollar Picasso sold for $140
A million-dollar drawing by Picasso was won by a 250-year-old American for just $140 in an online charity raffle, Reuters reported on Dec. 18.
 Art lover Jeffrey Gonano told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had been looking for a picture that will go on his living room wall.
 His winning ticket -- picked by a computer system -- was one of 50,000 to raise funds for an association working to preserve the ancient city of Tyre, in modern day Lebanon, Reuters explained.
 The raffle organizers told Reuters that buyers from France and Germany to Iran and Kyrgyzstan had taken part. 
 The sale of the picture was given the green light by Picassoâ€˜s grandson Olivier Picasso who said his grandfather would have been thrilled that his work was being put to good use, Reuters said.
