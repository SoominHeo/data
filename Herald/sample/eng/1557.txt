A gift exchange with Bill Gates
One woman’s secret Santa this year proved to be one of the richest men in the world, AP News said on Dec. 20.
The lucky girl identified only as Rachel, participated in a gift exchange at the website Reddit’s secret Santa event where users swap gifts across the United States.
 The person who presented the girl with a stuffed cow and a donation card was none other than Bill Gates.
A spokesman for Gates confirmed that he participated and further explained that Bill Gates wanted to engage with Reddit’s community to promote Heifer International, a foundation providing seeds and animals to people in need in developing countries.
 Meanwhile, the girl wrote in a blog post: “Bill Gates did not get you, because he got me.”
She also wrote: “I want to start by giving a huge thank you to Mr Bill Gates for an amazing gift and secret santa experience. Bill -you rock,” according to the British daily The Telegraph.
