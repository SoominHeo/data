Effectiveness of vitamin pills in question
Recent studies surprised many in late December by claiming that vitamins and supplements may not help avoid chronic diseases.
 The Annals of Internal Medicine of the United States said that there was no clear benefit in consuming vitamin supplements.
 In the editorial “Enough is Enough,” Eliseo Guallar of the Johns Hopkins University said there is no evidence of a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease or cancer.
 The article added that dietary supplements may help people meet nutritional needs, but eating various nutrient-rich foods would be a much better choice for most people.
 According to UPI News, Heather Mangieri, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics said in a statement that the best nutrition strategy for promoting health and reducing the risk of chronic disease is to wisely choose a variety of healthy foods.
 The statements further reads: “Small steps can help you create healthy habits that will benefit your health now and for the rest of your life.”
 Mangieri went on to suggest several nutrition ideas that can enhance people’s health:
 Start each day with a healthy breakfast that includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy for calcium and vitamin D, and vitamin C-rich foods.
  Pre-washed salad greens and pre-cut vegetables make great quick meals or snacks.
  Include at least two servings of omega-3 rich seafood per week. 
 Don’t forget beans, which are rich in fiber and folates.
