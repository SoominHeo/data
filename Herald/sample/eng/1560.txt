Radiant Orchid: 2014 color of the year
Following last year’s pick of emerald green, the purplish hue officially known as Radiant Orchid has been picked as the 2014 color of the year by Pantone Inc.
"It’s not a primary color,” explained Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. "It’s an invitation to innovation. The purple family offers (an) opportunity to do creative things.” 
 Radiant orchid was picked specifically because what it offers is in line with the current pop culture trend.
 "People associate purple with creativity and originality ? and those are very valued today,” Eiseman added. "We see words like that being used to describe technologies and products that are seen as innovative and with an approach you haven’t tried before.” 
 In addition to what the color symbolizes, Eiseman expects that the color will appeal to many people because it is a flattering color for many skin tones. In fact, the color has been featured in some runways and red carpet events. Eiseman notes that U.S. first lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing this color. 
 Pantone Inc., a corporation best known for its Pantone Matching System (PMS), sets the color standards for commercial use by design industries. Pantone’s pick for color of the year is expected to have a strong presence in fashion, beauty, home design and consumer products.
