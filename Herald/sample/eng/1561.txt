Ki's late goal pushes Sunderland to League Cup semifinals
Korean defensive midfielder Ki Sung-Yueng of Sunderland scored an extra-time winner to give his team a 2-1 win over Chelsea at the Stadium of Light on Dec. 16.
 Just two minutes of normal time remaining, in the 118th minute, Ki kept his composure and drilled a shot into the bottom corner of the goal. His game-winning goal came after an 88th-minute equalizer by his team mate Fabio Borini.
 The victory fired Sunderland into the semifinals of the League Cup, the Capital One Cup.
 "Football is about scoring goals and winning matches, not being the best team on the pitch,” Jose Mourinho, Chelsea manager, said after the match.
It was Ki’s second career goal for Sunderland. Ki joined Sunderland of the English Premier League on Aug. 31.
This is good news for soccer fans here in Korea, as the Korean national soccer team prepares for next year’s Brazil World Cup and Ki is included as a player.
In a recent survey conducted by Gallup Korea on 902 citizens, some 81 percent of respondents were optimistic about Korea advancing to the last 16 at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
In another survey by Gallup Korea, Ki was also chosen among Koreans’ top 10 athletes this year. The poll was conducted from Nov. 1 to 18 on 1,702 Koreans aged 13 or older, asking them to pick their top athletes.
