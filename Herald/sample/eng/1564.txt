Why young people are not interested in politics 
From the 1960s to the 1980s, students and people in their 20s used to be very interested in politics. Some gave up their lives to fight against the dictatorships. 
 But, these days, young people are busy minding their own business. The reason they are not interested in politics is obvious. It is because of keen competition of entrance exams and building “spec.”
 Education fever was one of the main factors that led to today’s economic success. But it has now led to ignorance of politics, because politics is of no use when studying math or English. To succeed in entrance examinations, learning math and English is more helpful than an interest in politics. This is on the minds of today’s students and their parents. 
 People in their 20s are busy building up their “spec” ? the list of things to add to their resume. Not only do they have to gain good scores in college and become diligent employees at work, but also they have to have a good level of experience. They don’t have any leisure time to get interested in politics. 
 The fact that there are so many other things to be interested in -- like sports, games and celebrities -- might be a reason, too. But, the main reason that students and people in their 20s are not interested in politics is because they are so busy with their own work.
