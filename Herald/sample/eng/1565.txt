Reasons that teenagers and people in their twenties don’t care about politics
When we elect our president or lawmakers, the government allows us to take a day off from work to vote. However, election days have simply become holidays. People don’t go out to vote, but instead go on trips or relax instead. But why don’t they go and vote? It’s because they don’t think their votes will affect the country’s politics, and they have enough things to worry about other than politics.
 First, they think their votes won’t make a difference. One vote can’t change the result. However, lots of votes can change the result, and that comes from a combined number of individuals. Their opinions are applied in ballots. Voting is like saving money. Every time, you save some pennies. Repeating this a lot, those will in the end become a gigantic amount of money. An individual can only vote once, and if lots of individuals vote, it will become lots of votes that can truly change the result.
 Also, people in their 20s have a lot to worry about. One of the biggest concerns of university students, usually in their 20s, is tuition fees. Tuition fees at Korean universities are enormous, and a lot of university students have problems with money.
 Nowadays, teenagers and university students are not interested in politics, and that is a serious problem because Korea might one day have a leader who does not care about what happens to our country. This serious problem must be fixed, and while the problem may be citizens’ political indifference, I think it is the government’s fault too. The government has not done enough to convince people that they can control and change this country. Also, they have not tried to help ease university students’ worries.
 My conclusion is that teenagers and university students usually do not care about politics because they don’t think that they can change anything even if they vote, and they have a lot of other things to think about rather than politics.
