Anti-poster guidelines spark freedom of speech dispute
The Ministry of Education’s recent campaign targeting middle and high schools to stem the spread of student political posters has sparked controversy over the possible violation of children’s freedom of speech.
Daejabo, or handwritten posters, have been appearing all across the country after a Korea University student posted one that read, “How are you?” on Dec. 10. The initial poster dealt with controversial social issues in Korea today, including the railway strike and health care privatization. More than 60 universities and high schools have seen similar posters with the same title appear all over campus.
In response to the growing trend, the Ministry of Education sent out guidelines to provincial education offices, asking schools to focus on enabling the students to focus on their studies. The guidelines went so far as to suggest that the posters may damage the academic atmosphere. 
Although the statement does not explicitly tell schools to prevent students from putting up posters, some say that it is the only method that would comply with the ministry’s guidelines. 
The ministry has come forward to defend its new guidelines but it has done little to stem the growing controversy, especially online.
A number of organizations concerned with students’ rights are said to be considering taking the issue to the National Human Rights Commission.
