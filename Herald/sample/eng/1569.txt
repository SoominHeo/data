Leaders send Christmas wishes for a better world
On his first Christmas Day speech as the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis sent a message of hope and peace to an estimated crowd of 150,000 gathered at the Vatican.
 His traditional Christmas “Urbi et Orbi” blessing was sent out from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.
 In his address dominated by calls to end international conflicts, the pope asked the world to end the “hatred and vengeance” in Syria, “heal the wounds of the beloved country of Iraq and conflicts in South Sudan, which was torn apart by a spiral of violence and poverty.”
 He also called on people of all religions to unite against war, wishing the coming year would finally bring an end to Israeli-Palestinian conflict and declare Palestine as an independent state. He wished for “a favorable outcome in peace talks between Israel and Palestine,” while speaking to the crowd in Italian.
 The pope also asked for the protection for victims of natural disasters, including victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.
 He went on to add: “Child of Bethlehem … look upon the many children who are kidnapped, wounded and killed in armed conflicts, and all those who are robbed of their childhood and forced to become soldiers.” 
 Another holy message came from Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain. The queen sent an annual Christmas message at St. Mary Magdalene church, in Sandringham, where the royal family attended their Christmas service. “With so many distractions, it is easy to forget to pause and take stock. It is important to strike a balance between reflection and action,” she said.
 In his Christmas speech, U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans “to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper.”
