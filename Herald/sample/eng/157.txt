Rooney suspended
Wayne Rooney of Manchester United was given a three-match suspension from international competition by UEFA on Oct. 13, after he received a red card during the Euro 2012 qualifying game in Podgorica. 
According to AFP, the ban by UEFA means that Rooney will miss all of England’s first round matches at next year’s finals in Poland and Ukraine. 
“It’s a huge blow,” Alan Shearer, the former captain for England told BBC radio, “It’s not only a huge blow to the team, to the fans and to football followers but to Wayne himself because he realizes he’s made a stupid error.”
