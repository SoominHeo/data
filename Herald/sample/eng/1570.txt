Everything you could possibly want to know about January
History of the month of January 
 In Korean, the first month of the year is traditionally known as first month (a word derived from moon), but have you ever considered why it is called “January” in English?
The word January - or Ianuarius in Latin - was named after the ancient Roman god of beginnings and transitions, Janus. The god Janus had two faces, which allowed him to look forward into the coming year and backward into the past year. As such, the first month of the year was named in honor of Janus. However, January wasn’t added to the calendar until around B.C. 713. 
The original Roman calendar began in March and consisted of 10 months totaling 304 days until the semi-mythical second king of Rome Numa Pompilius was said to have added the months of January and February. It is believed that the two months were added to the calendar to match the standard lunar year, which had 354 days. 
Despite having been added at around B.C. 713, January wasn’t widely considered the start of the year until the 16th century. In the Middle Ages, March 25 and Dec. 25 were among some of the many dates that were used to mark the New Year in Europe. When European countries officially began making Jan. 1 the start of the year at the beginning of the 16th century, it was sometimes referred to as “Circumcision Style,” because the date coincided with the date of the Feast of the Circumcision, which took place on the seventh day after Christmas.
