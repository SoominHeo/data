Playing in streets banned in Florida
A Florida community in the U.S. banned children from playing in the streets, leading residents to voice opposition, according to UPI news on Dec. 29.
Advanced Management, a managing company of the Miramar neighborhood in Florida, prohibited kids from playing on the one road passing through the 172-unit subdivision, for the kids' own safety, according to the company.
But residents there were dissatisfied with the new rule.
“I just want to be outside, tossing a football. They are taking away all the fun, to be honest. We just want to go outside and play,” said a 15-year-old resident Nico Cardenas to the UPI.
“I think it's ridiculous, kids should be able to play in their neighborhood. This is their home. They’re part of our community,” a homeworker Kimberly Koch also said to the news outlet.
UPI further said that a town hall meeting to address the issue had been arranged.
