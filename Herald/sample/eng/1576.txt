Firefighters lift cow from pool
McMinnville firefighters spent a tough day on Dec. 29, lifting a 700-pound cow out of a swimming pool, UPI news said.
Homeowner Jeff Dyck called the fire department when his cow fell into the pool, according to the news.
He coaxed the cow to the pool's side and waited for the firefighters to arrive. Then the firefighters put straps around the cow and tried to draw it completely out of the pool.
But the cow slipped and fell, forcing the firefighters, Dyck and two teenagers to turn the animal upright. They managed to lift it out of the pool.
Fire Chief Rich Leipfert said to local media that the cow was safe in the barn minutes later.
