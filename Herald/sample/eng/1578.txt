Hyundai, Kia settles fuel economy lawsuit with $395 million
Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. agreed to spend up to $395 million to settle lawsuits filed by customers in the U.S. claiming the companies had overstated the fuel-economy ratings of their vehicles.
In a statement on Dec. 23, Hyundai’s U.S. unit said it would make payments totaling as much as $210 million to people who purchased their vehicles between 2011 and 2013. In a separate statement, Kia Motors said that it would make payments valued at as much as $185 million to owners of about 300,000 of its vehicles. 
“They both want to get this matter buttoned up to set the stage for a good product launch period,” Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, told Bloomberg News. “Fuel economy is important to consumers. They want to know the mileage figures claimed are real.”
Fuel economy 
What is it? 
Fuel economy refers to the relationship between the distance traveled and amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle, also referred to as a vehicle’s fuel efficiency. 
A vehicle’s fuel economy can be described in two different ways: The volume of fuel required for traveling a certain distance (i.e. 8.1 liters per 100 km, or 8.1 liters needed to travel 100 kilometers) or the distance a vehicle can travel per unit volume of fuel consumed (i.e. 12.5 km per liter)
 Why is it important? 
A good fuel economy is important for four reasons: it can save you money, reduce climate change, reduce a country’s oil dependence and increase energy sustainability. 
For example, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, a car with a fuel economy of 9.4 liters per 100 km can save you almost $800 worth of fuel compared to a car with a fuel consumption of 14.1 liters per 100 km.
