Outfielder Choo lands lucrative deal with Texas Rangers
Cincinnati Reds player Choo Shin-soo has reached a 130 million, seven-year contract with the Texas Rangers after he completed a physical test, according to news reports on Dec. 28. 
 Chooâ€™s deal is the third highest this off-season, behind second baseman Robinson Cano (10 years, $240 million with Seattle Mariners) and outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury (seven years, $153 million with the New York Yankees). 
 It is the largest-ever deal for an Asian major leaguer -- the previous record was a five-year, $90 million (95.5 billion won) deal that Japanese-born outfielder Ichiro Suzuki struck with the Seattle Mariners in 2007. His deal also includes a limited no-trade provision and performance bonus package.
 Choo was the only premier offensive player left on the market after Robinson Cano signed with Seattle Mariners and Jacoby Ellsbury went to the New York Yankees, ESPN says. 
 Choo enjoyed the most productive season of his career with the Cincinnati Reds in 2013. He hit 21 home runs and posted 20 steals for his third-career 20-20 season. He was one of the top hitters in 2013 with a .423 on-base percentage, a .285 batting average, 54 RBIs and 107 runs scored.
 He will be the perfect addition to the Rangers as it were looking for more power at the plate.
 Choo debuted MLB with the Seattle Mariners in 2005 and was traded to the Indians in 2006.
