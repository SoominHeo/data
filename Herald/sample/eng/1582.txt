‘Tarzan 3D’ takes you on an adventurous jungle ride
Tarzan is back! If anyone expected a hint of Disney’s 1999 film “Tarzan” in the latest “Tarzan 3D,” they will be stunned to watch this new film.
 “Tarzan 3D” is a brand new version of “Tarzan,” with its visual imagery different from that of Disney or of any other animation studios, such as Dreamworks or Pixar. 
 From erupting volcano scenes to extensive sequences of Tarzan swinging through trees, the motion capture technique used in the fantasy film “Avatar” was also used in the film. 
The storyline has been reinvented to give a more futuristic and science-fiction-like twist to the fantasy tale.
 Jayjay lands in a deep, uncharted forest during a helicopter crash. His father, John Greystoke, the founder of Greystoke Energies and his mother both died in the accident. He is raised by gorillas and grows to become the king of the jungle, Tarzan. After Tarzan’s father passed away, Greystoke Energies is taken over by an evil man named William Clayton. He becomes a new CEO and tries to find a renewable energy source in the jungle where Tarzan was raised. The army dispatched by Clayton destroys the jungle’s ecosystem. And Tarzan and Jane, Tarzan’s first human crush, must face these hooligans.
 Tarzan has been loved by so many fans all over the world since his creation in 1912. 
 A total of 57 films, five dramas, four animations, and a number of musical and theatrical performances have been created based on the original story.
 Actor Kellan Lutz -- who appeared in the Twilight franchise -- did the voice acting for Tarzan. The family film was directed by a German studio and it came out in Germany on Oct. 10, 2013.
 It will hit Korean cinemas on Jan.9. For more information about the movie, go to tarzan3d.co.kr.
