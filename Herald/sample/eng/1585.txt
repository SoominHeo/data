The reason why people are indifferent toward politics
These days, most people in their teens and 20s are indifferent to politics. Most of them don’t know about political issues. They don’t understand the importance of politics. 
Why are they indifferent to politics? 
First, they are too busy. Most Koreans in their teens and 20s are students or young job seekers. They have to study and get a lot of certificates to get a job at a big enterprise. Do you think that they have time to watch TV or read newspapers? I don’t think so. So young people lack information about politics, and it leads to political apathy. 　
The second reason is disappointment in politicians. We can see lots of examples of political corruption in the media. When we see that, we are disappointed in them. I think maybe that is the one of the biggest reasons that teens and 20-somethings are indifferent to politics.
The last reason is smartphones. As you know, we usually use smartphones in our free time. Some people use smartphones to take part in politics by leaving opinions about political issues, but most young people do not. They chat and play games or search the Internet for news about their favorite singers or actresses.
Politics is very important. And it has to be decided by us. We have to be interested in politics and take part in it. I hope you realize the importance of politics and take part in it in the proper way.
