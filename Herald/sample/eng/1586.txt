A nice finish to the year 2013
The year 2013 has been full of wonderful memories that I cannot ever forget. Throughout the year, I have experienced a lot of things and also made some important decisions that have made 2013 so special and unique. 
Half of my time was spent attending school. I had a great time making new friends and learning with them. With my friends, I have achieved a great deal throughout the school year, including in basketball. With our mutual hobby, basketball, my friends and I practiced our skills for one hour every day during lunch time. As a result, I am now a great basketball player. 
Other than basketball, I have so many exciting moments I want to remember, such as when I went on a trip to Gyeongju with my friends, or when I came sixth out of 120 in a cross-country race. 
I want to commemorate the end of the year 2013 by recalling all of the events that happened this year. I think it is an opportunity to spend the time I didn’t have before because of my busy schedule to reminisce on my priceless memories. By doing so, I feel like I am keeping all of the warm memories in my heart. I will look over the photos and chat with my friends about the changes have we seen in each other.
Moreover, I will spend my last moments of the year with my family, traveling around places together. My dear brother will be departing Korea for college next summer and, for personal reasons, I haven’t seen my father for about a month. The best thing that I can do is to stay in touch and spend time with them.
