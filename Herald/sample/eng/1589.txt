For all the entertainers who worked hard over the past year, the year-end Entertainment Awards Ceremonies of the big three broadcasting companies is the light at the end of a very long, hard tunnel. Most entertainers work hard all year for the chance to earn the coveted Grand Prize Award.
This year, the big winners are comedians Kim Byung-man and Kim Jun-ho, and the cast of “Dad! Where are you going?”

“I really want to thank Lee Kyung-kyoo, Kang Ho-dong and Yoo Jae-suk,” he said tearfully to a standing ovation. 
“I was really happy when I learned I was nominated alongside them and I was looking forward to the results. They go beyond this award. I want to thank them for helping nurture me despite being just a mere sprout,” he added.

A stunned Kim Jun-ho was surrounded by his friends and colleagues at Gag Concert as he accepted the Grand Prize Award at the 2013 KBS Entertainment Awards Ceremony on Dec. 21. 
“I was looking forward to the results this year because the response to my nomination wasn’t as bad as last year,” he confessed during the recent ‘KBS Entertainment Awards winners’ special episode of “Happy Together 3.” 
When MC Yoo Jae-suk mentioned that Kim looked particularly nervous throughout the night, Kim added that he forgot most of his acceptance speech because of his best friend Kim Dae-hee’s tears when they hugged on stage.
