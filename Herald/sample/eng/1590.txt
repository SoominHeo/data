Terrorism hits Russian city ahead of Sochi Olympics
Two terror attacks in Volgograd, Russia that killed at least 34 people on Dec. 30 are believed to be massive protests against Moscow ahead of Sochi Olympics, NBC News reported.
 Russian authorities say the suicide bomber who detonated bombs at the train station was an ethnic Russian male who converted to Islam. Another suicide bomber in the bus bombing in Pyatigorsk was reported to be an ethnic Slav. 
 Experts note that more Russian Muslims who have converted to Islam are being used as suicide bombers. 
 “These ethnic Slavs have been used more frequently as suicide bombers and masterminds,” said Alexey Malashenko, a scholar at Carnegie’s Moscow office. 
 What makes matters worse is that Russia’s security services are ill-prepared to prevent the kind of small-unit attacks like these, according to anti-terrorism experts. They have only been trained for large scale attacks and are vulnerable to this new strain of Russian terrorism, they say.
 “There is a big problem as far as Sochi is concerned, the penetration of very small groups and individual terrorists,” added Malashenko. “If, for instance, Russian security services are concentrated around the Olympics in Sochi, that will facilitate terrorist activity in other cities of the federation, including Moscow.”
 With the 22nd Winter Olympics to start less than a month away on Feb. 6, security concerns are escalating all over the world. 
 Already U.S. counter-terrorism officials proposed cooperating with Russian officers to protect athletes, coaches and visitors during the Olympics. 
 “You can be sure we’re taking a hard look at this. A new security assessment for the Olympics isn’t going to wait that long. The Olympics begin in weeks,” one U.S. official commented.
