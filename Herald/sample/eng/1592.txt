Brain robber arrested
A man who stole human brains and sold them on eBay has been arrested in the U.S., the British Mirror News reported on Jan. 5.
David Charles, 21, from Indianapolis broke into the Indiana Medical History Museum to steal preserved human matter including brain tissues, the news quoted American authorities as saying.
Charles then went on to sell what he stole on the online auction site eBay, only to be arrested by the police the next day.
The police, who had investigated several break-ins at the museum, were tipped off by a man from San Diego who bought jars of human brain tissue on eBay for $670, said Mirror News.
