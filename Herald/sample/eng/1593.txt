Firefighters free girl from washing machine
An 11-year-old girl from Utah who got stuck in a washing machine while playing hide and seek was removed by firefighters on Jan. 4, according to news reports.　
The girl who thought she was not going to be found tried to get out of the machine, but her legs had fallen asleep and she was unable to get out of the washer, said the reports.
After the parents’ unsuccessful attempts to remove her for over an hour using ice and warm water, they were forced to call 911.
The firemen who arrived with tools used for car crashes were ready to cut her free, but the crew managed to get her out without using them, said the reports.
“Afterwards we laughed about it,” the girl’s mother told NBC news. “But at the time it was scary.”
