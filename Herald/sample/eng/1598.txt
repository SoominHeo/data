Eccentric Chinese magnate offers to buy New York Times
An eccentric Chinese recycling mogul has offered to purchase the New York Times Co., something he has been considering for years, according to Reuters. 
Best known for handing out cash to victims of China’s 2008 earthquake and free cans of “fresh air” during a particularly bad bout of pollution in January 2013, Chen Guangbiao is a well-known philanthropist and pseudo-celebrity in China. His offer to buy a controlling share of New York Times Co., though unsurprising, however, is nothing more than wishful thinking.
Not only is it unlikely that the Ochs-Sulzberger family ? who has owned the Times for more than 100 years - be willing to give up control, the company’s chairman, Aruthur Sulzberger, Jr. himself stated in August that the Times was not for sale. 　
“If we act in sincerity and good faith, I believe the Times chairman will change his way of thinking,” Chen was quoted as saying by Reuters. “There’s nothing that can’t be bought for the right price.” 
Chen has conceded that if he were to be unable to buy the New York Times, he would settle for becoming a controlling stakeholder. If that plan falls through, he would simply buy a stake in the company. 
Chen, whose desire to purchase the Times stems from its influence around the world, went so far as to say that if his offer to buy the Times failed, he would extend offers to CNN, the Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
“As long as they have some influence, I’m still willing to consider buying lesser media outlets,” he said.
Chen, whose net worth is estimated to be 5 billion yuan (just under $200 million) by the Hurun Report, built his fortune through his recycling company, the Huangpu Renewable Resources Utilisation Group.
