Science research ship rescued in Antarctica
A Russian research ship that was stuck in Antarctic ice for over a week was rescued on Jan. 2 following repeated failed attempts.
 The ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy, with 74 scientists and passengers on board was trapped in the ice on Christmas Eve.
 Although three icebreaking ships were mobilized to reach the ship, all of them failed due to bad weather.
 Then the Aurora Australis, an icebreaker sent by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s Rescue Coordination Centre, came within 20 kilometers of the ship on Dec. 30, but was unable to reach the research ship due to strong winds and heavy snow.
 Three days later, news reports said, the rescue team discovered a patch of ice that could be used as a landing spot for a helicopter, and then a chopper on board a Chinese icebreaker swooped in to move the stranded scientists and passengers from the ship.
 The Chinese helicopter carried the people to the ice patch, where a small boat ferried them to the Aurora Australis.
 Climate scientist Chris Turney who led the Russian research team told the Associated Press during the rescue operation that the passengers were finally relieved and excited to go back home.
 The Russian ship left New Zealand on Nov. 28 for Antarctica, hoping to recreate Australian explorer Douglas Mawsons’ voyage from 1911 to 1913, according to AP News.
The Aurora Australis was expected to reach the Australian island of Tasmania by mid-January with the passengers.
