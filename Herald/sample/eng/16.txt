First step of my dream
Everyone must have a dream. Our dreams make us happy, excited, nervous, and busy. My dream is becoming a famous writer like Mark Twain. Because of my dream, I truly wanted to be a Junior Herald student reporter. So I knew that I had to go to a camp all about English. 
I joined the camp because of my dream, but on the other hand, I wanted to discover what it would be if I had to work and study with people I don’t know. And I soon knew that this camp was for learning English and training student reporters, but also for learning self-directed learning and socialization.
 When working in groups and helping each other, we had fantastic teamwork. But the most impressive thing was that I saw everyone working and studying to achieve their dreams. I found that everyone has a dream and which is very important to each of them. 
After the camp, I now have confidence in my English. Also, this camp helped me to improve my speaking and listening skills. At my English academy, I’m trying to use the information and skills I learnt at the camp.
 This camp had let myself say, “It was a good time and chance to learn and find my dreams with others.”
 Finally, I truly think that the camp was a good experience for me and also to others. So I hope everyone finds their dreams and works hard to achieve them with all their might.
