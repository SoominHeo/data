Nuclear power fights against global warming
John Beddington, Britain’s chief scientific adviser highlighted the significance of nuclear power in the fight against global warming at a Seoul forum on climate change on Oct. 12.
Last March’s nuclear crisis in Japan made a few nations panic and even decide to abandon nuclear power all together. To these nations, Beddington sent a warning message, saying nuclear energy was essential to cut carbon emissions. 
Given that the world has no luxury to dismiss any kind of technology at this point, let alone nuclear power, he urged greater efforts to the international community.
“Without nuclear energy, there would be a completely catastrophic increase in energy prices,” he cautioned.
Fears of radioactive material released into the air sparked the global concern over the safety of nuclear power. It led Germany to say it would shut down all of its nuclear reactors by the end of 2022.
However, Beddington noted that people need all technology possible if they are to “address, not just climate change, but food security, water security and energy poverty.“
He said volatile weather caused by climate change has brought about more floods, droughts, tropical storms and forest fires of greater intensity and has decreased overall crop yields all across the globe.
