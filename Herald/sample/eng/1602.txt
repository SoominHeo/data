Everything is for sale, says film ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’
The film begins with Leonardo DiCaprio saying: “My name is Jordan Belfort. The year I turned 26, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.” 
 The movie talks about a penny stockbroker’s (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to success in the 1990s when stock market was a huge boom in the U.S. But the film does not only depict rosy days on Wall Street; it sheds light on the dark side of it.
 Belfort becomes a stockbroker in New York and his snobby boss played by Matthew McConaughey recommends him to adopt a lifestyle of partying to be successful in the business. After Belfort loses his job on Wall Street, he creates his own firm, Stratton Oakmont and earns a fortune out of it. He becomes a billionaire and maintains a high life. Yet his firm engages in securities fraud and corruption and Belfort ends up serving 20 months in prison for defrauding investors. 
 This satirical, biographical comedy directed by legendary film director Martin Scorsese is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort’s memoir, “Catching the Wolf of Wall Street.” It is Scorsese’s fifth collaboration with Hollywood’s A-list actor Leonardo DiCaprico.
 The film has made the list of best films of 2013 by MTV and Leonardo DiCaprio has been nominated as best actor at the Gloden Globe Awards which will take place this month.
 The film opened in local theaters on Jan. 9.
