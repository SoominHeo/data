Dongdaemun Design Plaza 2 months away from completion
Dongdaemun, one of the largest commercial districts in Korea, will have its new face revealed in March with the opening of the latest masterpiece by star architect Zaha Hadid.
The Dongdaemun Design Plaza and Park will be unveiled amid anticipation that the new flashy building and its adjacent public park will attract citizens who have been waiting for the opening for years.
The design project kicked off in 2007, but underwent major design changes after historical artifacts were discovered at the construction site.
Despite criticism by those who consider the construction project inappropriate for the area, the park is expected to set a good example as an innovative modern structure using state-of-the art digital technology.
“Its design and construction sets many new standards of innovation. The park is the first public project in Korea to use three-dimensional digital construction administration services that ensure design and construction quality,” Zaha Hadid said in an email interview with The Korea Herald.
A military training site of the Joseon dynasty discovered at the construction site have been incorporated as part of the new building without sacrificing the original design plan. 
The 85,000-square-meter structure consists of five halls which will host major design events, exhibitions and conventions. 
Some of the biggest events include Seoul Fashion Week, scheduled to open in March along with a rare showcase of some of Korea’s most prized traditional art works.
The park will also open design shops 24 hours a day in line with the working cycle of Dongdaemun, where fashion wholesalers work around the clock.
