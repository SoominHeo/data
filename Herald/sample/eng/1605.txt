My diary at the end of 2013
This year was the best year for me. If someone asks me that what my best-ever year was, then I will answer that the best year of my life was 2013. So, I really want to commemorate this year well.
First, I want to have a great time with my family at the end of the year. If I can have some time with my family, then I will tell them about the experiences I had in 2013 and hear about theirs as well. Also, I want to eat some delicious food with them and we could talk with one another and enjoy our last moments of the year.
 Secondly, I want to have some time with my friends. I had a very happy year thanks to my friends. So I want to meet them and go to a cafe or restaurant together. If I get to do this, we could talk to each other and share some really funny stories that are related to 2013.
 Third, I want to make some plans for next year. I had a really great time this year so I want to have more beautiful days in 2014. If I make some plans then I will be very proud and happy. 
 Many people will commemorate this year with someone special or by themselves. I hope that everybody has a great time on the last day of 2013 and on the first day of 2014.
