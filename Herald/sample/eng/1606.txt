Child abuse problem
Child abuse refers to adults harming childrenâ€™s health and welfare by physical, mental or sexual violence. In Korea, the problem of child abuse is really serious, and it appears in current affairs TV programs quite often.
First, we must educate students effectively to prevent child abuse. We should develop education methods that are easy to understand for students, instead of meaninglessly repeating the same program over and over. For example, we could tell students about a shocking example of child abuse and teach them how to handle that situation wisely.
Also, we should tighten child abuse laws. Everyone knows this. However, the penalty for child abuse in Korea is not as strong as in other nations. Therefore, the National Assembly must establish stricter child abuse laws and the government must focus its efforts to prevent child abuse according to the stricter law.
Violence against children can happen to anyone if people are not careful with it. Therefore, the most important thing is to protect ourselves. I hope that you will protect yourself realizing the seriousness of the child abuse problem in our society.
