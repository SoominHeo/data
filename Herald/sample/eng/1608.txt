 Fellow Koreans, 
 New year 2014, the year of the blue horse, has begun. 
I wish you all a year full of hope and the energy of a galloping horse.
Despite many difficulties in the past year, your confidence and support helped us pull through. 
Building on the trust, we were able to nurture the seeds of hope and change. 
In the new year, the administration will continue to do all it can to reap a bountiful harvest so that every one of you will be able to live a richer and happier life.
My administration will channel the national capabilities into reinforcing the hard-won gains of economic recovery, so as to invigorate the economy and stabilize the day-to-day lives of the people. I hope all of you will also join forces to prepare for an economic takeoff. 
A top priority for reviving the economy as well as a prerequisite to that end is to protect national security and public safety. 
The government will strive to maintain an impregnable security posture and prepare specific contingency plans against any possible provocation by the North. Building on this, the government will redouble its efforts to further promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and lay groundwork for peaceful reunification. 
My Administration will also continue reforms to set right the wrong practices rooted throughout our society. 
As we open a New Year and embrace new changes, I ask all of you to join us. My administration will do everything it can to ensure 2014 brings greater hope and vitality to you all.
Thank you for your support and encouragement over the past year, and again, a very happy New Year to all.
