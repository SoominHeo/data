International schools seen as alternative to overseas study
Thousands of Korean students find themselves enrolled in overseas schools every year as parents harbor hopes of giving them an edge over their peers in Korea’s hypercompetitive society. More and more parents, however, have begun to turn to international schools in Korea as an alternative to sending their children overseas.
Originally set up to educate the children of foreign employees and Korean students who studied and lived overseas due to their parents’ jobs, international schools in Korea generally have strict admissions regulations and its annual tuition fees that are almost 14 times higher than ordinary high school fees. However, the limited admissions and high tuition costs have done little to deter the demand for international schooling among Korean parents. 
“In order to meet the qualification, there are some parents who send their kids overseas for three years or even some who manipulate their children’s nationality,” said Chung Jin-hoo, a lawmaker and member of the national Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee.
In fact, statistics from the Ministry of Education show that the number of Korean students enrolled in the nation’s international schools grew to 4,000 in 2012, accounting for 31 percent of the total 13,000 students enrolled. 
A mother whose child is studying at a Jeju international school told The Korea Herald, “Despite the higher cost, I chose this school to raise my child in an international learning environment. The best choice for students in Korea may be to go to Seoul National University, but my child now has an additional option: Ivy League colleges.”
