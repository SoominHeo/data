Nature’s fury
A cyclone is a rotating storm that can be hundreds of kilomters across. These storms can be very destructive. The winds in a cyclone usually blow at more than 120 kilometers per hour. When a cyclone starts in the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean, it is called a “hurricane.” In the western Pacific Ocean, it is known as a “typhoon.”
 From above, a cyclone looks like a huge spinning doughnut of clouds. The center of the storm, the doughnut hole, is called the “eye.” The eye is quiet and cloudless. When the eye passes overhead, it might seem like the storm has ended. But within an hour or two, the eye passes and the other side of the storm hits.
 With its strong winds a cyclone also brings flooding rains and sometimes very high ocean waves. When a cyclone hits land, it causes severe damage. The combination of wind, rain, and waves can knock down trees, flatten houses, and wash away roads.
 Most cyclones start over tropical oceans because areas of warm water are their source of energy. Strong rotating winds that start on land are called “tornadoes.” A tornado, such as the one pictured here, starts for different reasons and is smaller than a cyclone. But a tornado also has very strong winds, so it too can be very destructive. It can knock a train off its tracks or lift a house straight into the air. Fortunately, tornadoes usually die soon after they start.
