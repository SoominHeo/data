Spanish princess Infanta Cristina summoned over fraud 
The youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos of Spain, princess Infanta Cristina, 48, has received a court summons over accusations of fraud and money-laundering linked to the business affairs of her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, BBC reported. 
 She is scheduled to appear in court on March 8 and it will be the first time a direct relative of the king has appeared in court accused of wrongdoing, the report stated. 　
 She will be questioned about her cooperation with her husband over alleged embezzlement from an organization that her husband ran. 
 The events are alleged to have happened between 2004 and 2006, when her husband, the Duke of Palma, stepped down as head of Noos Institute, a charitable non-profit foundation.
 It was believed that he misused millions of euros in public funds given to Noos Institute and last year some of the properties of the duke, including large luxury house on the outskirts of Barcelona, were impounded. The duke denied wrongdoing and was not charged with any crime back then. 
 Despite being a massive embarrassment to the nation’s royal family, there was a sense of satisfaction among Spaniards at the way the case was being handled, the report noted: “This is because we had come to the point at which the issue was no longer whether the princess was guilty of anything but actually whether justice is the same for everybody in Spain,” a Spaniard said.
 Spain’s Juan Carlos became king in 1975, when he oversaw the country’s transition from dictatorship under the late Gen. Francisco Franco to democracy.
