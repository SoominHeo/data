Black bear wants to stay near people
A black bear that has been hanging around near people’s homes doesn’t seem to want to leave, UPI News reported on Jan. 10.
Denise Carroll, a resident living in Juneau, the Alaskan capital, said she has been seeing the black bear around her home since November in an interview with a local media outlet, according to UPI.
Another resident said that when she first saw the bear it looked like a huge dog, as the animal was sitting comfortably, next to a staircase.
“I jumped a little ... the black bear was equally as startled,” said the resident to reporters.
Ryan Scott, a wildlife biologist, explained that the bear seems to be resisting hibernation to search for food in the city.
