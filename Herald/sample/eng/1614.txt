Secret behind longevity
An elementary school teacher in New Jersey said her students contributed most to her longevity at her 100th birthday party on Jan. 11.
The Sundance School teacher Agnes Zhelesnik is believed to be the oldest active teacher in the United States, said the UPI News.
Zhelesnik began teaching cooking and sewing at Sundance when she was 81, when her friends were retired or dead, said the news.
Meanwhile at the birthday party, the school’s principal read letters from President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, according to the news. The party was also attended by her daughter Agnes Arakelian, who also teaches at Sundance and a granddaughter and great-granddaughter.
Ashwin Sanjay, a student at the school who is one-tenth Zhelesnik’s age, told media that did not think of her as very old because her aura was so young.
