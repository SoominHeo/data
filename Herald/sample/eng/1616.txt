Freezing weather grips North America
Several parts of the world, in particular, North America, have been hit hard by “life-threatening” cold which has caused deaths and damage, The Guardian reported on Jan. 6. 
 Frigid cold sparked by what is called a “polar vortex,” swept the northern and central U.S. and Eastern Canada. The U.S. Midwest suffered the lowest temperatures in two decades. 
 In Chicago, the temperature dropped to minus 27 degrees Celsius. Flights were canceled as fuel supplies froze and schools were closed.
 The coldest part of the country was Babbitt, Minnesota, where temperatures of minus 38.3 degrees Celsius were recorded. Many pointed out that this was colder than the spot on Mars from which the Curiosity rover sent back a reading of minus 36 degrees Celsius on Jan. 2.
 In New York, the governor declared a state of emergency, announcing that parts of the New York State Thruway in Western New York would be closed due to extreme winter weather conditions. 
 “The coldest temperatures in almost two decades will spread into the northern and central U.S. today behind an Arctic cold front. Combined with gusty winds, these temperatures will result in life-threatening wind chill values as low as 51 degrees Celsius below zero,” a spokesperson for the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) said.
 According to NWS, the widespread chill was a result of a relatively infrequent alignment of weather conditions, allowing the Arctic “polar vortex” to be displaced unusually far south. 
 The polar vortex refers to a system of wintertime winds that are found on Earth, Jupiter, Mars and Venus and are colder than their surroundings.
