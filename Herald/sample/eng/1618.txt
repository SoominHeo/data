Athletes gear up for Sochi Olympics
President Park Geun-hye visited the National Training Center in northern Seoul on Jan. 8 to encourage Korean athletes who will compete in the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Yonhap News reported. 
 During lunch with the athletes, Park said she hoped their hard work and dedication would bear fruit in Sochi. 
 “The passion, confidence and vitality of our national athletes and coaches are a source of energy for our country,” she said. “The government will provide support to allow our athletes to compete in a more comfortable and fun environment.” 
 The president offered special words of encouragement to figure skater Kim Yu-na, speed skaters Lee Sang-hwa and Mo Tae-bum, and short tracker Shim Suk-hee, among other athletes.
 Kim will compete in Sochi to defend her Olympic gold. If she wins her second gold medal, she will become the third woman to do so after Sonja Henie and Katarina Witt. 
 Speed skater Lee Sang-hwa is the world record holder in the women’s 500 meters and is the most dominant female speed skating sprinter today. Mo Tae-bum just won the International Skating Union World Cup race last month. Therefore, hopes are running high for Korean athletes at the Sochi Olympics. 
 Another Korean player to keep a close eye on is Shim Suk-hee, a 16-year-old short track speed skater. She has overwhelmed her competition over the past two seasons; Shim is competing for two gold medals, both in an individual race and in the 3,000 meters relay.
 Korea’s goal at this year’s Olympics is to grab at least four gold medals and finish in the top 10. Around 64 South Korean athletes will be competing in Sochi in up to six sports including bobsleigh and skeleton.
