Korea’s third cardinal Yeom Soo-jung
Seoul Archbishop Yeom Soo-jung was appointed to the position of cardinal by the Vatican on Jan. 12.
 Yeom is the third Korean to be named so, following the late Stephen Kim Sou-hwan and Nicolas Cheong Jin-suk, who both preceded Yeom as Seoul archbishop.
 “The appointment of Cardinal Yeom reflects an improved status of Korea in the global Catholic communities. The Korean Catholic Church is entering a new era,” Cardinal Nicolas Cheong told a crowd that gathered at the Seoul Archdiocese building in Myeong-dong on Jan. 13.　
 A native of Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, Yeom graduated from the Catholic University of Korea with a degree in theology in 1970. He was ordained a Catholic priest in the same year. Yeom became the archbishop of Seoul in May 2012, succeeding Cardinal Nicholas Cheong. 
 Yeom is known by his acquaintances as a man with a big heart, whose love and care for the poor and needy has been a source of inspiration for others, said The Korea Herald.
 Yeom told the crowd at Myeong-dong, “With my mind quivering with fear (of the immense honor given to me), I humbly obey the pope’s (words).”
 “I am a man of many shortcomings, but I will do my utmost to fulfill this holy task,” he added.
 Born in 1943 to a devout Catholic family, he chose a life as a priest at age 15 and was ordained a priest in 1970. His two younger brothers have also followed him into the priesthood, with each now leading a diocese in Seoul. 
 He taught at his alma mater for years before becoming an auxiliary bishop of Seoul in January 2002. He has also served as the chairman of Peace Broadcasting Corp., a Catholic television and radio network based in Seoul, since February 2002.
 Meanwhile, the other Cardinals appointed by Pope Francis are from Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Europe, including the countries of Haiti and Burkina Faso.
