Revival of militarism must not happen
The first thought that went through my mind when I heard about the Japanese Prime Minister’s worship to Yasukuni Shrine was, ‘Oh my god!’ It was a shock and his act was criticized by many countries including America, China and Korea.
“Yasukuni” means “comfort the country,” but the shrine has been used to justify Japanese militarism. It serves to commemorate the Japanese soldiers that died in the wars Japan had started. The fact that 14 class-A war criminals, who committed unforgivable crimes during World War II, are also in the shrine makes the Japanese Prime Minister’s worship unacceptable. 
The Prime Minister’s act can be related to the Japanese government claiming that Dokdo is their territory. Dokdo was an island first controlled by Japan at the beginning of the Forced Occupation. That means that stating Dokdo is Japan’s domain implies the revival of imperialism and militarism. Similar to that, the Japanese Prime Minister’s worship at the Yasukuni Shrine indicates not only that the Japanese government won’t accept the truth of history any time soon, but also the revival of militarism. 
As a fan of Japanese movies, dramas and comics, I like Japan as a country. It will also be beneficial to Asia if Japan and Korea become good neighbors. So, I wholeheartedly hope Japan stops those actions and sincerely apologizes to all the World War II victims.
