Cornwall, my destiny
Do you have a place that you’ve dreamed about? Well, I always dreamed about a beautiful, peaceful port village. I was always searching for my dream village on the internet and in books whenever I had free time. Then, a few day ago, as if by fate, I stumbled across my dream place! A place called Cornwall, it is a county in England, close to France, and has a great many villages. Today, I would like tell you how Cornwall became the place of my dreams.
The first reason is because it is very clean and beautiful. While many port villages generally have a dirty image, this place was different. Even on the computer screen, Cornwall looked like it came straight out of a romantic movie with its very blue and turquoise water and green grass everywhere. 
The second reason is because there are a lot of things to do in Cornwall. Other parts of the countryside, especially little-known places like Cornwall, are not great places to have fun with your family. However, Cornwall is different. It is home to a lot of activities to check out at places like the Minack Theatre and the Eden Project. The Minack Theatre is a world famous open-air theater whose construction was made possible by an actress who devoted her whole life to building it. The Eden Project was originally a botanical garden-like research center for testing various plants’ adaptability to their environments, but over time it has changed to become a place where you can go to learn and experience the wonders of ecology. 
The reasons why I introduced the Eden Project are:
 1. It is home to the world‘s largest indoor rainforest and boasts a variety of natural environments such as steamy jungles and waterfalls.
 2. It has cutting-edge architecture and buildings 
3. It has world-class sculptures and art pieces
 4. It has an aerial walkway in the rainforest section, where you can take a stunning walk through the treetops
