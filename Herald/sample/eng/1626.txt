NEAT exams canceled, future in jeopardy 
The state-administered National English Ability Test (NEAT) for high school students has been canceled this year due to high operational costs and low demand, officials at the Ministry of Education announced on Jan. 15. 
“We’ve decided to scrap NEAT 2 and 3 tests as the basic operational costs have gone beyond 3 billion won annually,” a ministry official said.
While NEAT levels 2 and 3 targeting high school students has been canceled, the level 1 exam for adults will be held as planned.
Developed under the previous Lee Myung-bak administration, NEAT was first launched in 2012. One of the main goals was to develop a locally established English test to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign exams such as TOEFL and TOEIC. Due to the need to start from scratch, approximately 37.1 billion won was invested in the exam’s development over the course of four years.
Although the exam managed to overcome the many obstacles it faced at the beginning, doubts over its future hit an all-time high in August 2013. Already dealing with low exam registration numbers, the government reversed its plans to substitute NEAT for the English section of the College Scholastic Aptitude Test (CSAT) in 2016, further reducing the need and motivation for students to take the exam. 
The Ministry of Education has said it has no plans to completely do away with the costly project, but it has admitted that the number of applicants remained far below the ministry’s expectations. Originally held twice a year in June and July, only 424 students took the exam in July 2013.
