Toxic chemicals found in children’s clothes
Children’s clothing and shoes made by a dozen globally recognized brands have been found to carry potentially harmful chemicals, Greenpeace warned on Jan. 15. 
 A follow-up investigation by Greenpeace since its first one in 2012 showed that chemicals that “can have adverse impacts either on human reproductive, hormonal or immune systems,” are detected in almost all brands that the group tested, AFP reported.
 The group analyzed 82 products made by Adidas, American Apparel, Burberry, CA, Disney, Gap, HM, Li-Ning, Nike, Primark, Puma and Uniqlo. Of the products tested, 50 items, or 61 percent, were found to contain nonylphenol ethoxylates, or PFOA, which can break down and become toxic “hormone disrupters.” High levels of PFOA can cause reproductive harm, the group argued.
 “This is a nightmare for parents everywhere looking to buy clothes for their children that don’t contain hazardous chemicals,” Greenpeace East Asia campaigner Chih An Lee insisted in a statement. “These chemical ‘little monsters’ can be found in everything from exclusive luxury designs to budget fashion, polluting our waterways from Beijing to Berlin.”
 Some of the substances it tested were at concentrations as low as 1mg per kilogram but that does not mean those products are safe for children, the group noted.
 In 2012, Greenpeace held a “toxic” fashion show in Beijing to draw attention to harmful chemicals that high-street garments possessed. The environmental group has led a campaign to urge clothing brands to get rid of “all hazardous materials” by 2020.
