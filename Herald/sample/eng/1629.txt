Comedians have creative personality traits: study
British scientists found that comedians have more atypical personality traits than ordinary people, Reuters reported on Jan. 16.
A group of scientists at Oxford University revealed that comedians had high levels of psychotic personality traits through their study, according to Reuters.
The study of 523 comedians from Australia, Britain and the United States asked the participants to complete an online questionnaire that was made to measure psychotic traits, such as “unusual experiences,” “cognitive disorganization,” “introvertive anhedonia” and “impulsive non-conformity.”
The scientists explained that these unusual personality traits -- in their lesser forms -- can “increase people’s ability to think outside the box.”
They also said that such traits may help people combine ideas to form new, original and humorous connections.
