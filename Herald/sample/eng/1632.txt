Four kids share same birthday
A massive 133,225 to 1 -- those are the odds four children from the same parents will be born on the same date.
Such a thing has happened to the parents Emily Scrugham and Peter Dunn in Cumbria, England, on Jan. 12 when new baby Ryan was born to them.
The mother, accompanied by her three other children Sam, Brooke and Nicole, told local reporters that the fourth birth on the same day certainly had not been planned.
Congratulations to the couple, who surely don’t have to worry about remembering their kids’ birthdays.
