OECD unemployment rates fall
For the first time since June 2013, various countries around the world saw a drop in unemployment rates in November, suggesting that the labor market is finally starting to benefit from the modest economic recovery of 2013, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
The OECD announced on Jan. 14 that unemployment rates in its members as a whole fell from 7.9 percent to 7.8 percent. Among the countries that saw improvements, Mexico and Israel saw the biggest drops in unemployment with 0.3 percentage points to 4.6 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. 
Despite improvements in some countries, others saw increases in the number of people without jobs.
Italy saw its unemployment rate reach a new high at 12.7 percent, while Slovenia saw a 0.2 percentage point increase to 9.9 percent. Of the developed OECD members, Spain has the highest number of people unemployed, with 26.7 percent of its economically active population still looking for jobs, and Korea had the lowest. 
Among youth in the OECD, unemployment rates fell from 16 percent to 15.7 percent. This is considered a particularly encouraging development given that young people were hit the hardest by the shrinking job market in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The improved youth unemployment rate has helped alleviate some of the fear over the potential “lost generation” crisis, wherein the future of today’s youth is in jeopardy due to the lack of work experience.
Unfortunately, youth unemployment remains high in several European countries, most notably Spain (57.7 percent), Greece (54.8 percent), Italy (41.6 percent) and Portugal (36.8 percent). In Korea, the youth unemployment rate jumped from 7.5 percent to 8 percent.
