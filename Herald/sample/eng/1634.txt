Cars becoming lighter in 2014
The overall trend at this year’s U.S. auto show in Detroit was most definitely the use of lighter materials, for example, aluminum replacing steel and the use of carbon fiber or other lightweight materials to cut vehicle weight. 
 These non-traditional materials -- aluminum, carbon fiber and magnesium -- are part of global automakers’ concerted efforts to reduce vehicle weight and raise gas mileage, AFP reported.
 Ford unveiled the company’s new F-series pick-up truck during the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 15. Its new F-series pick-up truck, F-150, is freshly equipped with an aluminum body. The company needs to prove it is durable even with a lighter weight in order not to disappoint buyers, the report added.
 F-series pick-up trucks have been the best sellers in the U.S. for almost four decades and shifting from steel to aluminum is a radical change, especially for the company that has established its brand power with the slogan “Ford Tough,” suggesting lots of steel on its vehicles.
 In addition, convincing American buyers who are accustomed to cars being built with solid steel won’t be easy. 
 Not just aluminum but other solutions for lighter vehicles were introduced at the venue. Strong, ultra-light carbon fiber is becoming another option for some auto parts though it is not cheap. For instance, Kia’s new small sports car, the GT4 Stinger, unveiled in Detroit, used carbon fiber wheel rims and BMW also used carbon fiber in the interior of its electric i8 sports car racer. 
 “There is no silver bullet. It’s not all about substituting a material for another -- it’s also about engineering,” remarked GM senior executive Mark Reuss at the auto show.
