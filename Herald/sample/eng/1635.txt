Women’s influence on the rise in Seoul
Recent statistics compiled by the Seoul Metropolitan Government show that Korea is evolving from its traditional patriarchal society into a matriarchy. 　
According to the data, Korea has entered into an era in which the number of female heads of households has hit nearly 1 million, taking up 28.1 percent of the total. In addition to leading households, 4 in 10 businesses have female CEOs. 
The growing influence of women in Korea is not limited to just economic status, but can be seen in the increasingly disproportionate number of women seen in public areas. In fact, it has become increasingly popular to jokingly refer to the trendy Gangnam area as “Yeo-cho,” a portmanteau of the words “female” and “excess,” for the excessive number of women seen in the area. 
Rather unsurprisingly, the Gangnam district’s status as predominantly populated by women has been officially verified as being close to the truth by government statistics. 
The statistics compiled by the Seoul government found that 52 percent of the population in Gangnam-gu is female, with the proportion of households headed by women rising to 32.6 percent, the highest in Seoul. On the other hand, the district with the highest number of female CEOs was Jung-gu. Survey results showed that 58.6 percent of female CEOs operate businesses in the lodging or restaurant industries while 44.3 percent operated businesses in education, health or social welfare-based service industry.
