N. Korea to join Asian Games’ football event 
North Korea said on Jan. 20 that it would participate in the Asian Games to be hosted in South Korean city of Incheon.
 According to news reports, the North’s Korean Central News Agency said on the same day in a brief article that the country’s athletes will participate in both men’s and women’s football events in the Asian Games.
 But the state-run agency did not specifically state which games other than soccer it would participate in during the games.
 South Korea invited the North to join the Asian Games through the Olympic Council of Asia, but the North did not reply to the request for a long time.
 Incheon Mayor Song Young-gil said in an interview with Yonhap News that he welcomed the North’s participation in the football event and hoped that the country would compete in other sports as well.
 In the past, North Korea boycotted the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but it sent its squad to the 2002 Asian Games in Busan.
 Meanwhile, the current inter-Korean ties are in a state of limbo, with both parties accusing the other of lacking sincerity.
 In early January, South Korean President Park Geun-hye proposed a new round of inter-Korean family reunions but the North rejected the proposal: Since then the two nations have continued to argue over the North’s military provocations and the South’s joint-military drills with the U.S. Army.
