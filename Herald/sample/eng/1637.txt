Nicole and Kang Ji-young leaving KARA 
Two members of K-pop girl group KARA are leaving the group once and for all, the group’s management agency DSP Media said in a release.
 “Our contract with Nicole will expire on Jan. 16,” DSP Media said. “Regrettably, Nicole will terminate her activities as a member of KARA, but we offer words of encouragement and cheer for the future.” 
 Nicole is reportedly planning to go back to the United States to continue her studies. Her shocking departure was covered by several news outlets in Japan and China, including Japan’s Nikkansports and China’s Sina, reflecting the band’s high popularity overseas. In fact, KARA’s earnings from overseas markets make about 60 percent of their total income.
 Following Nicole’s departure, the youngest member of the group Kang Ji-young also gave the agency written notice that she would not renew her contract once the present one ends in April. DSP Media said that Kang had also indicated that she wished to study abroad. 
 Last October, the agency signed new two-year contracts with three members -- Park Gyu-ri, Goo Ha-ra and Han Seung-yeon. The remaining three members will focus on individual activities including TV drama and film appearances in the first half of this year. The group will also release a new album in the second half of 2014, according to the agency.
 Another member left the group before. Kim Sung-hee left the group in 2007. The following year, Goo and Kang joined. KARA debuted in 2007 and enjoyed fame not only in the domestic music scene but more prominently in Japan, regularly scoring hits on major music charts there.
 Although Nicole’s departure had largely been expected, she and Kang both calling it quits was a shock, at least to the group’s devoted fans. 
 The agency is looking into different options for KARA, but said it had “no immediate plans to add a new member” and asked people to “continue to show their love and support as KARA comes back with a fresh look.”
