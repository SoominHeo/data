Former prodigy realizes dream of becoming professor
Kim Ung-yong, a former South Korean prodigy once hailed as the smartest soul on Earth, is about to fulfill his dream of becoming a professor.
Chungbuk Development Corporation announced in mid-January that 51-year-old Kim was leaving its staff to serve as a professor at Shinhan University in Gyeonggi Province.
Kim taught students part-time at prestigious universities including Yonsei, Sungkyunkwan and KAIST, but he said it had always been his goal to become a full-time professor.
But Kim’s career so far has been far from extraordinary, and his critics wonder why the former child genius came to lead such an ordinary life. He was once listed as having the world’s highest IQ by the Guinness Book of World Records. 
Kim reportedly was able to speak four languages by age five, and grabbed international attention by solving differential equations on a Fuji TV show in Japan. He also worked at NASA even before he hit puberty, and nothing seemed to hold him back. Then he suddenly called it quits. 
Kim left NASA in 1978 and entered Chungbuk National University three years later as a civil engineering major.
Media swooped down on him and branded him a “failed genius.” Heavy coverage portrayed his life as a case of education for gifted kids gone horribly wrong. 
Regardless, Kim has maintained that he has led a happy life. Kim said he did not want to draw attention as a genius or become famous, and said he wanted a normal life with his family and friends.
