Stop abusing children!
These days many child abuse cases have been happening. One of the most prominent examples was in Ulsan.
 It was an act of child abuse carried out on a girl named Seo-hyun by her stepmother. It was a terrible case. 
 Seo-hyun’s biological parents divorced in 2007. Her mother had to live apart from her daughter, and she lived with her father.
 Her father remarried, but her stepmother did not give her any food, and made her change her name to Chae-woo. One day, Chae-woo told her stepmother that she wanted to go on a field trip to Ulsan. Then Park beat her to death.
 We can’t stand such child abuse any more. We have to protect these children. So how can we stop these scary things from happening again? 
 Even though child abusers may not intend to abuse children, they must be punished. If we give them a light punishment, criminals will not regret their wrongdoing and our country will be full of “unpunished criminals.” Therefore, these assaulters have to be punished like murderers. If the law does not effectively deal with child abuse, it should be changed.
