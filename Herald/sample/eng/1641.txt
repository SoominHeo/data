‘Inception,' a movie with amazing imagination
I like the movie “Inception” very much. 
 Whenever I have some free time, I watch movies. So I have watched a lot of movies so far. One movie that impressed me was Christopher Nolan’s “Inception.” 
 Christopher Nolan is very popular movie director. He made many films including “Memento,” “The Dark Night Rises,” “Man of Steel” and so on. However, most people say that “Inception” is the best of all of his films. And I think so, too.
 “Inception” is a movie about a man who goes into people’s dreams. The main character, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an “extractor.” Simply put, he is a dream stealer. He goes into people’s dreams with a dream machine. 
 Cobb can’t meet his family because of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). One day, he gets an offer from the CEO of a company, Saito (Ken Watanabe). The CEO tells Cobb that he can meet his family if he succeeds an “inception” into the dreams of the son of a rival CEO, Robert Fisher (Cilian Murphy). In this movie, the term inception is used to plant a kind of concept in someone’s mind.
So Cobb hires staffs to carry out the operation. First, he hires the dream designer, Ariadne (Ellen Page). He also hires a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Hao) as a drug maker. Then he gets ready to carry out the inception on Fisher. I will stop here. I recommend you watch this movie. It has amazing imagination.
