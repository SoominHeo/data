Thailand declares 60-day state of emergency 
Thailand’s capital has been shut down as the Thai government imposed a 60-day state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces on Jan. 22, BBC reported.　
 The state of emergency was announced after 28 people were injured in central Bangkok on Jan. 19 when grenades were thrown at protesters that blockaded some parts of the capital. 
 “The cabinet decided to invoke the emergency decree to take care of the situation and to enforce the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul remarked.
 “We will use peaceful negotiations with the protesters in line with international standards... We have told the police to stick with international standards, to be patient with the protesters,” Yingluck told reporters.
 Labor Minister Chalerm Yubamrung, who will oversee the decree’s implementation, added that the government would not use force, as it has no policy to “disperse the protesters.” 
 The emergency decree would give the government power to censor the media, ban public gatherings and detain suspects without charge. It will also enforce curfews, the report noted.
 Protesters have been rallying in the streets of Bangkok for months, waging a campaign to oust the country’s Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. They argue the government is run by exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, the current prime minister’s deposed brother. 
 Prime Minister Yingluck has refused to resign and called for a general election on Feb. 2 to contain the unrest. However, doubts were raised by officials whether conditions are peaceful enough for the vote to go ahead.
 Protesters have instead called for an unelected “people’s council” to run the country until Thailand’s political system is changed.
