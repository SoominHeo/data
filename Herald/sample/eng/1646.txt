February facts and figures
Last month, in Issue No. 499 of The Junior Herald, we took a look at everything you could possibly want to know about January. Along the same lines, it is time to take a look at the many interesting facts and figures about the second month of the year, February.
 Known as the month with the weirdest -- and hardest -- spelling, February is a time generally associated with romance thanks to the widely celebrated, yet sometimes dreaded, holiday: Valentine’s Day. However, there is more to February than just celebrating couples’ love for each other with flowers, chocolates and romantic dates. In fact, just like the month of January, February has a rich and interesting history that begins with the Ancient Romans.
 History of February 
 As with January, the month of February was added at around B.C. 713 - some 40 years after the original Roman lunar calendar was created - by the semi-mythical second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius. 
February, or Februarius as it was originally written on the ancient Roman calendar, was named after the Latin term “februum,” which means purification. This etymology for the second month of the year dates back to an ancient Roman festival of ritual purification that used to be observed on Feb. 15, called Februalia or Februatio. When February was first added to the calendar, it was placed at the end of the calendar so that March was the first month, followed by April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January and February. 
As a result, many of the festivals and observances held on Februarius prior to about 450 B.C. had themes that related to death or the end of something. For example, the nine-day festival Parentalia (Feb. 13-21) was held in honor of family ancestors while Terminalia (Feb. 23) was a festival in honor of the god of protecting boundaries, Terminus.
