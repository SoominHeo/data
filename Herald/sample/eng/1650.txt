Man Utd fan makes crazy call to police
A drunken Manchester United fan called the police to talk to Alex Ferguson, the team’s former manager, on Jan. 22, Reuters reported.
The drunken fan called the emergency line and tried to complain about United’s semifinal loss to Sunderland.
According to Reuters, the man called 999 and said: “The result is all wrong. They had extra time and it was a total and utter load of rubbish.” 
Then he asked to be put through to Ferguson.
The local police posted a message in response on its Facebook. The official message read that the only thing the police could do was suggest the person in need ring Manchester United FC directly.
