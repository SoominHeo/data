Rome fights chaotic parking
Cars and scooters combined with Italian creativity are putting the country in jeopardy as far as parking is concerned, according to news reports on Jan. 24.
But disorderly parking, such as in the middle of the street, is about to be monitored and punished by Rome’s police, Reuters said.
Citizens who notice illegal parking can alert the police, who will then reply to say when they have taken action, said the news.
The new head of Italy’s urban police force Raffaele Clemente told Reuters in an interview: “Sharing, such as on social networks, is needed to fight certain patterns of illegality and rule-breaking, and also of crime.”
