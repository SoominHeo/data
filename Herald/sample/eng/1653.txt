Korea beefs up efforts to stop spread of bird flu 
The Korean government has continued its efforts to prevent further spread of bird flu amid reports of two new suspected outbreaks, Yonhap News Agency reported.　
 A new suspected case of avian influenza (AI) was reported at a duck farm in Gochang, North Jeolla Province, and another at a duck farm in nearby Jeongeup on Jan. 20. 
 This brought the total number of suspected AI cases to 10 -- four of which have been confirmed through DNA tests as carrying the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus.
 Quarantine officials have been tracking the movement of migratory birds after the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was found in a group of migratory ducks that were found dead at a reservoir near South Jeolla province.
 The AI virus has an incubation period of up to three weeks. “This means avian influenza could break out at any time throughout the winter season when the disease is most rampant,” noted Kwon Jae-han who is in charge of the matter at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.
 As a precautionary measure, the government ordered all other poultry farms located within a 3-kilometer radius of the farm that reported the first outbreak to take daily inspection and all ducks within the area will be subjected to culling. About 200,000 poultry have been slaughtered as of late January.
 “The most important point in our quarantine efforts is to prevent the flow of any source of infection, such as excrement of migratory birds, into poultry farms,” Kwon added.　
 The country has reported four outbreaks of bird flu since 2003. The most recent outbreak in 2010-2011 led to the culling of over 6 million animals, causing over 80 billion won ($75 million) in losses, according to the report.
