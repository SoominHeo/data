Li Na of China collects her first Australian Open title
China’s Li Na won her first Australian Open title by defeating Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Jan. 25. Li showed an edgy performance against Cibulkova leading the final by 7-6 (7-3) 6-0. It was the 31-year-old’s third time making it to the Australian Open final and her second major title since the French Open in 2011. 
 “Finally I got her (the Australian Open trophy). Now I have to thank my team. Thanks to my agent for making me rich, thanks a lot,” Li said after the game.
 The third-time Australian Open finalist advanced to the final by beating 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard with a 6-2, 6-4 win at the semifinal. Li lost last year’s Australian Open to Victoria Azarenka partly because she was unlucky; she twisted her ankle and fell over twice during the important match. After the French Open last year she even considered quitting the tour but she kept on going. 
 Meanwhile there were many surprises in this year’s women’s match. Probably the most dramatic one was Cibulkova’s reach to the final. The 1.61-meter diminutive Slovakian player defeated 2012 Wimbledon finalist and No. 2-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-1, 6-2 to reach her first Grand Slam final. She also upset Russian tennis superstar Maria Sharapova in three sets. Serena Williams losing in the fourth round was another big surprise. 
 “It was my first Grand Slam final and I’m just proud with the way I handled it. I wanted to play my best tennis but it wasn’t easy against Li Na because she was playing extremely well, so I’m quite happy,” Cibulkova said after the final game.
