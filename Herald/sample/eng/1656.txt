EXO wins top prize at 23rd Seoul Music Awards 
K-pop idol band EXO claimed the top prize at the 23rd Seoul Music Awards on Jan. 23 at Jamsil Stadium, southeastern Seoul. 
 EXO, a South Korean-Chinese boy band, consisting of 12 members, has gained explosive popularity at home and abroad since its official debut in early 2012. Their first full-length album “XOXO (Kisses Hugs) sold more than 1 million copies, becoming the first million-seller in 12 years in the Korean pop music industry. Last year, their song has swept local music charts. 
 The sensational group already earned numerous music honors including album of the year at the Mnet Asia Music Awards and song of the year at the Melon Music Awards for their song “Growl” in 2013.
 Last year’s sure-fire bet at the Seoul Music Awards was rapper Psy, who was a global sensation with “Gangnam Style.” This year, veteran singer Cho Yong-pil was seen as EXO’s strongest competition. Cho released his 19th full-length album in 10 years, and his title song “Hello,” was well received by fans irrespective of their age. 
 EXO has also been named one of the 14 rising artists to look out for in 2014 by Billboard magazine in the U.S. EXO is the only Asian group mentioned in the magazine’s 14 Artists to Watch in 2014, which was posted online on Jan. 20.
 British soul musician John Newman, U.S. pop duo Holychild and U.S. RB singer Banks were on the list.
 “EXO looks positioned to be K-pop’s next crossover phenom with an American fan base brewing for the 12-member boy band. The video for southern hip-hop-inspired ‘Growl’ was 2013’s third most viewed K-pop music video in the U.S., after the internationally recognized PSY and Girls’ Generation,” Billboard said. 
 “They also snagged the fifth- and ninth-biggest-selling K-pop tracks in America last year for ‘Growl’ and dubstep-inspired ‘Wolf,’ respectively,” it added.
