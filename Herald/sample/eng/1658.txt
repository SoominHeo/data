K-pop hologram theater opens in Dongdaemun
Have you ever found yourself yearning to go to a K-pop concert but couldn’t afford to buy the “good” tickets close to the stage? Rather than settling for watching your favorite idol on TV, why not see them in hologram form in Dongdaemun? 
Thanks to the cooperation between the government, telecom giant KT Corp. and globally recognized entertainment giant YG Entertainment, a state-of-the-art hologram concert hall featuring popular K-pop stars has recently opened its doors inside the Lotte Fitin shopping mall in the Dondaemun Market area. Dubbed “Klive,” the theater features a variety of digital attractions and concert performances. It occupies 1,650 square meters of floor space on the 9th and 10th floors of the shopping center.
According to a press release from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, the concert hall will hold eight holographic performances a day of Psy (“Gangnam Style” and “Gentleman”), Big Bang (“Bad Boy” and “Fantastic Baby”) and 2NE1 (“I’m the Best” and “Fire”).
In addition to the realistic, high-definition holographic concerts, K-pop fans can enjoy the many other exciting aspects of Klive ranging from the exciting “Augmented Reality Elevator”, which allows visitors to feel like they’re riding the elevator alongside the artists, to the more generic artist-related exhibitions displaying such items as G-Dragon’s concert car and outfits. 
Fans may find the “Star Photo Box” to be a particularly exciting feature of Klive, for it allows visitors to take pictures with their favorite artists and print them out. There is also, of course, the gift shop, an essential part of any entertainment venue. The Klive gift shop carries more than 1,000 different K-pop-themed goods that are sure to appeal to fans of all ages.
