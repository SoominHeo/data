My favorite book: ‘Demain’
I read a book called “Demain” written by Guillaume Musso. I read this book because my friend told me that books written by this author are great.
I was shocked after reading the book “Demain.” This book has really shocking twist at the end. The book is about the story of time travel and secret love. 
It tells the story of three people - Mathew, Emma and Kate. 
One day, Emma and Mathew begin emailing each other. However, Emma lives in the year 2010 and Mathew lives in the year 2011. Also, Mathew has a wife. Her name is Kate. When Mathew first began emailing Emma, Kate was dead. 
While Kate was alive, she had a secret boyfriend named Nick. Nick and Kate had fallen in love a long time ago. Unfortunately, the two of them couldn’t get married because of Nick’s heart disease. 
One day, Kate and Mathew met in the hospital as doctor and patient. Mathew was in love with Kate from when they first met. However, Mathew was being deceived by Kate. Kate had planned on causing brain death in Mathew so that she could give his heart to Nick. The truth was discovered by Emma. In the end, Emma told Mathew everything and they ended up falling in love each other. Kate and Nick were killed by Emma.
I was really shocked by the many plot twists in the book. If you read this book, you will fall in love with this book and you would find yourself looking for other books by this author. Although I can’t reveal everything about this book, if you enjoy reading novels that have a little bit of cruelty and fantasy in them, “Demain” by Guillame Musso would be really interesting for you.
