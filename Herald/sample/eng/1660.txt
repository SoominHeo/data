The country that I want to visit: France
In 2010, I visited France to be part of a performance, not for sightseeing. I was really sad and regret the fact that I was in France for only two days. As such, I want to go there again.
I want to visit the Louvre museum in Paris because it has so many paintings and statues that I have seen in art textbooks. When I was in school, I was always very interested in French artwork. I want to see some of them in real life. That would be awesome. 
When I visited the Louvre museum a long time ago, I saw some very famous works of art, such as Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s Mona Lisa and the Venus statue. I want to see more of what the Louvre museum has to offer.
I also want to walk along the streets of Paris. When I was in fourth grade, I only rode the bus while traveling. Therefore I was only able to see Paris through a window. However, I think the buildings of Paris are very pretty. This is the reason why I want to go back and see the buildings again.
When I visited France as a fourth-grader in elementary school, the country seemed so fantastical and beautiful. Therefore, I want to go to France one more time.
