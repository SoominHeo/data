East Sea vs. Sea of Japan 
Dispute over the proper naming of the sea between Korea and Japan has provoked a diplomatic conflict in a U.S. state, AFP reported on Feb.2.
 In Virginia’s capital Richmond, how the sea between the two U.S. allies is named in students’ textbooks brought in an unusual diplomatic feud. 
 For a long time Washington’s Virginia suburbs have taught students that it is called the Sea of Japan, but Koreans see this name as a legacy of Japanese colonialism. 
 “The Korean people have used the name for more than 2,000 years and even the Korean national anthem starts off with the East Sea,” said Korean-American community members who initiated the move to change Sea of Japan to East Sea in the U.S. They launched a petition on the White House website to change the naming of the sea. They think the Japanese government’s efforts to keep the name Sea of Japan effectively extend the country’s history of military expansionism.
 Since 2010, efforts to show Koreans’ historical grievances over Japan’s colonial rule have been piling up in many parts of the U.S. with cities like New York and Los Angeles setting up statues in honor of so-called “comfort women” who were forced into sex by imperial Japanese soldiers.
 Japan has reportedly teamed up with a major law firm to block the move to keep the name of the sea between the two nations as Sea of Japan.
 Masato Otaka, minister for public affairs at the Japanese Embassy argued that Sea of Japan was the only name recognized by the United Nations and the International Hydrographic Organization. Sea of Japan was in use in the early 19th century when the country had an isolationist policy, Otaka insisted.
