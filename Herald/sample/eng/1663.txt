Oil spill spreads in waters off the coast of Yeosu
A town that was once hit with one of the worst oil spills in Korean history is once again forced to deal with clean up efforts after an oil tanker collided with three oil pipelines causing oil to spill into the waters off the coast of Yeosu, South Jeolla Province, according to the Korea Coast Guard.
The tanker reportedly hit a landing bridge as it tried to moor at the Yeosu quay, causing pipelines connected to petrochemical facilities operated by GS Caltex Corp. to rupture and spill oil into the sea. The oil slick then rapidly spread south, covering the shoreline of Shindeok village with a thick, black sheen. 
As of Feb. 2, a Korea Coast Guard official told reporters that approximately 70 to 80 percent of the leaked oil had been contained thanks to the clean up efforts over the two days following the leak.
“We will do our best to minimize the damage to the residents,” a representative of GS Caltex said, amid growing concern over the effects of the oil spill. 
Shindeok village, where hundreds of residents earn their living by harvesting shellfish and seaweed, suffered one of Korea’s worst oil spills almost 20 years ago, when some 5,000 tons of oil contaminated its coastline. It had taken five months to clean up the spill and the resulting damage was estimated at 150 billion won ($140 million). 
Although officials have estimated that this recent accident resulted in at least 1,000 liters of oil leaking into the water, some residents say that the amount may be greater than expected because GS Caltex reportedly took about an hour to completely close their valves. 
As of Feb. 3, the extent of the spill and damage, as well as compensation for residents of affected areas, was not yet determined.
