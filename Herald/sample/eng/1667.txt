Passport not allowed for man with weird name
A British man who changed his name from Mathew Whelan to a much longer one was denied a passport, UPI News reported on Feb. 3.
The 34-year-old man from Birmingham has given himself the new name “King of Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite.” But when he eagerly applied for a new passport, the national Passport Office refused to issue it.
UPI said that the man changed his name in 2009 and has the new name on the driver’s license.
The man -- known as Body Art for short -- was angry. 
“This is a breach of my human rights,” he told UPI. “They want to put my birth name on my passport. But that is not my name any more.”
