Sinkhole swallows family car
A nine-meter sinkhole opened up and swallowed a family car overnight in England on Feb. 2, according to the U.K.’s Daily Telegraph.
Although no one was injured in the incident, the Volkswagen Lupo was shattered to pieces and people in the area expressed concerns as to similar occurrences in future.
The place in High Wycombe is reportedly built on chalk, and an engineering expert told the Telegraph that the hole may have formed over thousands of years.
“While such cavities may remain intact below ground for hundreds of years, very rarely the sudden collapse of the material may occur, perhaps when disturbed by extreme rainfall or a recent change in land use,” said the expert.
