Samsung and Google forge new alliance with patent deal 
In a move that is sure to make Apple, Inc. feel the heat, Samsung Electronics Co. and Google Inc. have reinforced their alliance by agreeing to share intellectual property rights, the Korean tech giant announced on Jan. 27.
Under the new agreement, both Google and Samsung will be able to access each other’s existing patents in order to boost Samsung’s software and Google’s hardware capabilities. The agreement covers existing patents and those filed during the next 10 years. 
The deal is sure to help the two behemoths significantly improve their research and development of innovative products and technologies. 
Samsung smartphone products already account for more than 60 percent of the market share in Korea, where 9 out of 10 smartphones run on Google’s Android platform compared to the 5.1 percent running on Apple’s iOS. 
With Samsung projected to take up 36.2 percent of the world’s smartphone market in the first quarter of 2014, the two companies are clearly looking to widen that gap with this patent deal.
“This agreement with Google is highly significant for the technology industry,” said Ahn Seung-ho, the head of Samsung’s Intellectual Property Center, in a statement. “Samsung and Google are showing the rest of the industry that there is more to gain from cooperating than engaging in unnecessary patent disputes.”
Allen Lo, deputy general counsel for patents at Google, echoed this sentiment, adding that “by working together on agreements like this, companies can reduce the potential for litigation and focus instead on innovation.”
