Power of believing
Believing that you had a good night’s sleep can actually improve your cognitive abilities, according to a new study.
 Researchers at Colorado College found that people who were told that they’d had a good night’s sleep even if they hadn’t outperformed those who were informed they had slept badly, The Telegraph reported on Jan. 24.
 The researchers assigned 164 participants into two groups ? “above average” quality sleep group and “below average” quality sleep. Those in the “above average” group were told that their sleep quality from the night before had been above average and those in the latter group were informed that theirs was below average.
 Then researchers measured the participants’ ability to listen and process information. People who were told they had slept well performed far better regardless of how they originally felt about their sleep. 
 The phenomenon is believed to be a result of the placebo effect, which occurs in patients who are given inactive drugs and believe they work, leading to improvements in their health. 
 “In these experiments, cognitive functioning appeared to be mediated by placebo information, as it was dependent on the assigned sleep quality told to the participants as opposed to their actual self-reported sleep quality,” said Christina Draganich and Kristi Erdal who led the study.
