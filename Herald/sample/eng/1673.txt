Making the best of Korea’s monthly ‘Culture Day’
In October 2013, the Presidential Committee for Cultural Enrichment announced its plan to enforce a monthly “Culture Day” in Korea. That plan went into effect in January 2014, with Korea celebrating its first “Culture Day” on Jan. 29, the day before the Lunar New Year holiday began.
 But, what is “Culture Day”? 
 “Culture Day,” designated as the last Wednesday of every month, is a day when numerous cultural events, museums and theaters offer free or discounted admission to their patrons. As an added bonus, many national and public institutions (like libraries) will extend their hours on this day. The basis of this day was to provide Korean residents with a better chance of exploring and experiencing culture in various forms. 
 So, where can you go on “Culture Day”? 
 To begin, Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine are among the many cultural and national landmarks that are providing free admission to visitors on “Culture Day.” Although it may seem like only dry, boring historical sites will take part in “Culture Day,” fear not: Even movie theaters are going along with the plan, offering tickets for just 5,000 won between 6-9 p.m. 
For those more interested in performances and the arts, places like the National Theater of Korea and the Seoul Arts Center are also providing free or discounted tickets to their events.
Is nature more of your style? Places like the Korea National Arboretum in the Gyeonggi Province has announced that it will also offer free admission during every “Culture Day.” Interested in sports? A variety of professional basketball and volleyball games have discounted tickets (up to 50 percent off) for students in elementary school looking to catch a game with their families.
