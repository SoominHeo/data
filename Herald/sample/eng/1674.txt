Thoughts on Abe’s public worshipping at Yasukuni Shrine
Shinzo Abe, the prime minster of Japan, formally worshipped at the Yasukuni Shrine on Dec. 26. When this news was reported in Korea, people said it was beyond deplorable. 
 Abe claims that his action should not face any international condemnation. In my opinion, the Japanese prime minister’s current behavior is not right for the moment. 
 Many countries objurgated Abe’s worship at the Yaskukuni Shrine, and they called on Japan to say sorry for their past action. 
 Yasukuni Shrine is an enshrinement place where war criminals from World War II and officials who worked for Japan during the Japanese colonial era are honored. It is worshipped by Japanese citizens. Paying a visit to the shrine is harmful, and as a leader of Japan, Abe worshipping it publicly is especially rude to Koreans who suffered through Japan’s invasion and exploitation of their country. 
 In conclusion, Shinzo Abe’s actions connote a will for war and disturbing world peace. This attitude is not acceptable in the global society.
 After the Japan Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster in 2011 about half of Japan’s territory became unusable. People of Japan are in confusion and the situation is still out of hand. So Japan is finding other international talking points to unite its people. 
 However, I believe that shattering world peace while trying to unite citizens is not right. Shinzo Abe and Japan need to find better solutions to their problems.
