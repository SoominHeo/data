Return of Imperial Japan?
The day after Christmas, the Japanese prime minister paid a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors war criminals of Japan’s imperial past. 
The Yasukuni Shrine is viewed negatively by Japan’s neighboring countries because not only does it honor the war dead, it honors 14 class-A criminals convicted for their crimes during World War II. Prime Minister Abe explained that he wanted to pray for the war dead, not honor war criminals, but his actions brought much anger and disappointment from countries like Korea, China and the United States. 
 This is not the first time the Yasukuni Shrine has been an issue among East Asian countries. Every time a Japanese politician has made a visit to the shrine, Korea and China have vigorously protested it. So why do they keep doing it? 
 Continuing what is viewed by other countries as honoring World War II criminals shows that the Japanese government is still nowhere near admitting their past wrongdoings, which means that another imperial Japan could rise up. 
 The Japanese government has yet to fix their errors throughout history like officially acknowledging the abuse of “comfort women” and correcting textbooks and maps that claim Dokdo as their territory and the East Sea as Sea of Japan. 
 If these actions continue, the relationship with eastern Asian countries can only drift apart, so I think Japan had better start to clean up the mess they’ve made, starting with its government officials not visiting the Yasukuni Shrine.
