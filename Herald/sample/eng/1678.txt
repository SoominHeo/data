Italy overwhelmed by massive flow of migrants 
A massive and unrelenting influx of migrants reached Italy by sea last year in the hopes of escaping war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East, BBC reported.
Over 2,000 migrants landed on Italian shores in January 2014, compared to 217 in the same month in 2013, according to the Italian government.
“Italy was subject to an incessant and massive influx of migrants in 2013,” Deputy Interior Minister Filippo Bubbico pointed out. According to Bubbico, a majority of the migrants came from Syria, which accounted for 11,307 migrants compared to 582 in 2012, followed by Eritrea with 9,834 migrants, an increase of more than 400 percent over the previous year. They also came from Libya, Egypt and Turkey.
A total of 2,925 vessels of various shapes and sizes landed on Italian shores last year, carrying about 43,000 people, including some 4,000 children -- a jump of 325 percent from 2012. Of them 37,886 landed in Sicily, including 14,753 on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa. The region is now struggling to cope with the thousands of migrants coming ashore. 
 Many are risking their lives in the perilous sea journey. In October 2013 alone, more than 400 people drowned in two shipwrecks near the island of Lampedusa, the closest Italian territory to North Africa. Immigration charities say that between 17,000 and 20,000 migrants have died while crossing the sea over the past 20 years.
 Overwhelmed by the situation, Italy is trying to reduce the maximum amount of time people could stay in immigration detention centers from current 18 months. It has also called for help from other EU states.
