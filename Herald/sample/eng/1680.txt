The spectacular success of ‘Frozen’
No one can deny that Disney’s latest animated film, “Frozen,” is a hit. Breaking all sorts of records both in and out of the U.S., “Frozen” has warmed the hearts of many this winter season. 
Not only has the film pushed Disney’s profits past what was anticipated in the first quarter, “Frozen” also broke box office records around the world. In fact, “Frozen” became the highest-grossing animated film in Korea and Denmark and set an opening weekend record in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. According to the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), in Korea, the film earned more than 47 billion won ($44 million) as of Feb. 2, having opened in theaters on Jan. 16. The previous record-holder “Kung Fu Panda 2,” grossed approximately 44.3 billion won ($41 million) in 2011. 
In fact, although the film cost Disney at least $300 million to produce and market, many expect it to generate more than $1 billion in just movie ticket sales alone. However, the popularity of “Frozen” goes beyond mere movie ticket sales; the film’s soundtrack and merchandise will undoubtedly bring millions more in profits to Disney.
But what makes “Frozen” so special? Some have already begun calling the latest Disney animated film “timeless” and putting it on par with such Disney classics as “The Lion King,” “The Little Mermaid” and “Aladdin.” While it may be a little too early to tell whether or not “Frozen” can and should be called a ‘Disney classic,’ it certainly does have a few elements that help differentiate it from the other, merely popular animated films to come out in the past decade. 
“Frozen is not about the prince and the princess for once,” one mother told BuzzFeed. “It’s not a traditional story between a man and a woman; it’s the sisters who represent true love at the end, and that’s an excellent message for my girls.”
This representation of sisterhood in the film is one of the many reasons why the film appeals to such a wide audience. In addition to focusing on the relationship of two sisters over the traditional boy-saves-girl storyline, “Frozen” holds important messages about getting over your insecurities, sacrificing for the people you love and most importantly, learning to love yourself.
“Disney, more than any company, has the ability to create these films that continue to speak to generation after generation because of the timeless themes they address, and I think Frozen might belong in that pantheon of great films,” Josh Gad, who voices Olaf in the film, told BuzzFeed.
