Judge fired over ordering baby’s name change
A U.S. judge was fired after ordering a baby’s name be changed from Messiah to Martin, Reuters said in early February.
 The judge, Lu Ann Ballew in eastern Tennessee, ordered the change to the baby’s first name, saying Messiah was reserved for Jesus Christ, according to Reuters.
 The parents were actually in court before the judge seeking to settle other issues, according to the report, and were not prepared to face the unexpected ruling.
 The court terminated Ballew’s appointment over the judge’s “inappropriate religious bias.”
 Meanwhile, Messiah was the 387th most popular name for baby boys in the U.S. in 2012, based on applications for Social Security cards filed with the U.S. government, Reuters explained.
