Fisherman returns after year adrift
Jose Salvador Alvarenga, a fisherman in his late 30s, was found ashore on the Marshall Islands after drifting on the seas for a year, according to news reports.
 The 15-year career fisherman told reporters that he had set sail in December 2012 for shark-fishing and another young fisherman who followed him had not survived the long drift and died.
 Alvarenga went on to explain that he had been drinking turtle blood and catching fish and birds to survive.
 Meanwhile, officials from the U.S. Embassy to the Marshall Islands told the press that they were gathering information to determine the validity of the fisherman’s account.
 A host of media outlets raised doubt about what Alvarenga said, pointing to his sound physical condition.
