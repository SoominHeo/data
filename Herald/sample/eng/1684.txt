Korea wins big at Super Bowl
On Feb. 2, millions of people around the world tuned in to watch the Super Bowl. While it is no doubt that many of those who watched were sports fans, many more were also tuning in for the ads. In fact, having your advertisement air during the Super Bowl has long been considered an important marketing strategy, and this year, Korea struck it big. 
Advertising spots during the Super Bowl tend to cost corporations more than $4 million for just 30 seconds of airtime thanks to the sheer number of people who tune in to watch. While many may be watching the Super Bowl to see who wins, there are also thousands of people who tune in to see which corporations were willing to shell out the big bucks to market their products during this peak in viewership.
This year, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors - both owned by Hyundai Motor Corp. - paid big bucks to air three commercials during this coveted time slot, and their investment seems to have paid off. 
Hyundai Motor’s “Dad’s Sixth Sense” commercial for their all-new 2015 Genesis came in first among car commercials and sixth overall in a poll conducted by USA Today. According to Innocean Worldwide Corp., an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Group, not only was the Genesis ad well received by Super Bowl viewers, it also ranked third in an assessment made by Adweek, a weekly advertising trade publication.
