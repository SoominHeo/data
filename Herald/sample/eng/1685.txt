Japanese scientists claim major scientific discovery in stem cell research
Japanese scientists led by Haruko Obokata at Riken Centre for Developmental Biology have discovered a remarkably new way to convert mouse blood cells to embryo-like stem cells, the Financial Times reported.
 The study, which appears in the journal Nature, says that researchers in Japan succeeded in reprograming the animals’ adult cells into an embryonic stem cell-like (pluripotent) state by simply dipping blood cells into a small amount of acid for less than half an hour.
 Though the breakthrough was achieved in mouse blood cells, research is taking place to achieve the same results with human blood.
 If the new development works in humans, it offers huge potential for a new age of personalized medicine. Stem cell researchers note that embryo-like cells can transform into any tissue and be used for healing the eye, heart and brain and even cancer. It is a big leap toward curing blindness and a milestone in medical human cloning, they argued. 
 “If it works in man, this could be the game changer that ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using the patient’s own cells as starting material -- the age of personalized medicine would have finally arrived,” said Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London.
 During a news conference Dr. Obokata told the new technique, termed STAP (stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency) cells, could make stem cell technology cheaper, faster and safer.
