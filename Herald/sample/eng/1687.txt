Super Bowl 2014 -- most watched U.S. show ever
Super Bowl 2014 drew the biggest TV audience ever -- a daunting 111.5 million viewers -- for the game on the night of Feb. 2 at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
 Despite early ratings estimates that showed a significantly lower number of viewers would tune in for the match between the American Football Conference champion Denver Broncos and National Football Conference champion Seattle Seahawks to decide the National Football League champion for the 2013 season, official ratings for the game said 111.5 million viewers tuned in, setting a new viewership record in U.S. TV history. The number narrowly broke the 111.3 million viewers figure set in the 2012 game, Yahoo Sports reported.
 There were other records smashed at the night of extravaganza, inundated with pricey TV commercials. Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43?8, the third-largest point differential (35) in Super Bowl history. It was also the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city and the first in which two U.S. states, New York and New Jersey, shared hosting duties. 
 The nightâ€™s MVP went to Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith who threw a 69-yard touchdown. A knock-out performance by Singer Bruno Mars during the halftime show was the icing on the cake.
