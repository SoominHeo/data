 Former pope content with later years
Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned in a rare move in early 2013, seems to be at peace at himself and with the Lord, Reuters said on Feb. 9.
Archbishop Georg Ganswein, who is close to the former pope, said in an interview with Reuters that Pope Benedict had no regrets and believed that history would decide on his tumultuous years at the Vatican. Ganswein is currently working as the head of Pope Francis’ household.
The archbishop further explained about the pope’s peaceful daily life, his sound health and his ongoing relationship with Pope Francis in the interview.
Pope Francis was elected in March in 2013 after Pope Benedict’s resignation in the first such move in 600 years. During the time, Benedict cited his physical and mental deterioration as the reason for his resignation.
Ganswein, who has been at Benedict’s side since 2005, said to Reuters that the former pope had neither regrets about leaving office and nor resentment against his critics.
Ganswein said in the interview that the measure of one’s work is not what the mass media write but what is before God and conscience.
Benedict is known to live in a former convent in the Vatican gardens. Before he left office, he said he would live out his days hidden from the world in prayer, according to Reuters.
“Indeed, he is far from the world but he is present in the Church. His mission now, as he once said, is to help the Church and his successor, Pope Francis, through prayer,” Ganswein said to Reuters.
