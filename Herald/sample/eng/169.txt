Korean War soldierâ€™s sister paid just 5,000 won
The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs paid 5,000 won compensation to the sister of a deceased soldier in April 2011.
 At first, the ministry refused to pay any compensation on the grounds that the sister of a Korean war veteran did not file the claim within five years of his death. Furious about the ruling, the sister filed a lawsuit and won, but the ministry awarded her just 5,000 won. The ministry was said to calculate the amount by a strict and obsolete government regulations. 
 The tiny payment raised bitter public sentiment toward the Korean government. 
 In an effort to ease the public furor, the ministry decided to raise the compensation to 4 million won, the report added.
