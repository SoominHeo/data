The country I want to visit: Italy
The country I would most like to travel to is Italy. Italy has lots of things to see, including art museums, and lots of delicious food. There are a lot of reasons why I want to visit Italy.
First, I want to visit the Vatican City. Itâ€™s not exactly a city in Italy, but rather it is a small country. However, it is in the middle of Italy, so I want to go there. The Vatican City has many interesting things to see. There are the Swiss guards protecting the Vatican and the pope. They have funny clothes on. The clothes are colored red, blue and yellow. Seeing their bright colors sounds fun. There are many other things to see too.
Next, I want to see some paintings found in the museums. People go to Italy to see these works of art, painted by people like Botticelli. Some are from the bible and some are from everyday life. All of the paintings are beautiful.
Lastly, Italian food! Ice cream, spaghetti, pizza are all foods that I, and lots of other people, love. I just love these foods, and I fully support eating pizza and ice cream. I think eating at a nice restaurant in Italy would be heaven for me. 
These are some of the reasons why I want to go to Italy. I want to do all of these things when I visit Italy. And if others have a chance to go to Italy, I hope they can do them too!
