The Best Performance Ever - Musical ‘Les Miserables’
Last autumn, I went to Blue Square in Seoul with my family. It was fairly crowded with people. The reason for this was because it was where the musical “Les Miserables” was being held. “Les Miserables” is one of the “Big Four” musicals in the world. It has been performed for 28 years in 22 different languages in 48 countries around the world. This musical is based on a novel of the same name written by French author Victor Hugo. In Korea, it is known as “Jean Valjean.” It is a story about the characters’ struggle for revolution and redemption in 19th century France. “Les Miserables” was also made into a movie, which also did very well at the box office. 
The version of “Les Miserables” that I saw was the first time the musical was performed in Korean. Many great actors were featured in the musical, including musical actor Chung Seong-hwa, who played Jean Valjean, and Moon Jong-won, who played the role of Javert. They played their parts awesomely and won high praise from Ramin Karimloo, who played Enjolras, during the 25th anniversary concert of “Les Miserables.”
The musical starts with the song “Look Down,” which is sung by all the prisoners in a camp including Jean Valjean. The rivalry between Jean Valjean, who had been imprisoned for 19 years on charges of stealing a piece of bread, and Javert, a police inspector who considers the law very important, raised tensions. The focus was placed on not just the main character (Jean Valjean); minor characters also stand out as they sang about their situations. 
The songs that I found particularly memorable were “One Day More,” which was sung by all the characters, and “On My Own,” which was sung by Eponine who loved Marius, Valjean’s son-in-law. During the musical I got goose bumps all over and almost cried at the end. If ever it comes back to Korea, I would love to watch it again.
