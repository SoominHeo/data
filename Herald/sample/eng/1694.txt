King Edward VIIIâ€™s abdication speech in 1936
Of many kings in the British history, there is one who draws particular attention. It is King Edward VIII, who is the only monarch in the U.K. history to have given up his position. Edward became king when his father died in 1936. Months after he became king, Edward proposed marriage to an American woman Wallis Simpson. Despite strong oppositions from the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Edward chose to continue his relationship with Simpson and finally abdicated in the same year he ascended to the throne. The following is part of his abdication speech on Dec. 11, 1936. -- Ed.
 "At long last I am able to say a few words of my own."
"You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. But I want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country or the empire."
"I want you to know that the decision I have made has been mine and mine alone. This was a thing I had to judge entirely for myself."
"I now quit altogether public affairs and I lay down my burden. It may be some time before I return to my native land."
"Now we all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all. God save the king."
