Comedian Yoon Hyung-bin’s successful martial arts debut 
Comedian Yoon Hyung-bin, best known for his antics on “Gag Concert,” recently won his first mixed martial arts (MMA) fight at the Road Fighting Championship 2014, successfully transforming his image from a mere comedian to one you wouldn’t want to mess with.
Yoon’s win made headlines in Korea, not only because of Yoon’s impressive debut into the world of MMA fighting, but also because his fight was against Japanese fighter Tsukada Takaya, fueling the long-standing rivalry between the two countries. 
Competing in the special Lightweight Superfight category, Yoon stunned audiences by winning with a knockout punch in the first round. Although the fight began with Yoon getting knocked around, he soon came back with a well-aimed straight right that knocked the Japanese fighter down. With 40 seconds remaining in the first round, Yoon then began pounding away until the referee was forced to call off the fight. 
“I have to call my wife,” Yoon said right after the fight, according to local media reports. “She could not watch the fight, so she is waiting for my call.”
“A lot of people have been wondering, but the reason I wasn’t at the fight was because I was too nervous,” Yoon’s wife and fellow comedian Jung Kyung-mi said during the Feb. 10 broadcast of her MBC FM radio show. “As for the fight, it wasn’t until an hour after the fight ended that I was able to watch the video.”
“I burst into tears upon hearing that Yoon Hyung-bin had won” she added. “Now that people have seen what he can do with his fists, people should be more wary about messing with him too much.”
However, news of Yoon’s successful MMA debut was soon overshadowed by even more happy news: Just a year into their marriage, the happy couple is now expecting their first child.
