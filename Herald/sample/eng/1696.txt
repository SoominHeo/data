China and Taiwan hold high-level talks 
Taiwan and China held their first government talks in more than six decades on Feb, 11. They were the first of their kind since the tempestuous Chinese civil war in 1949.
Wang Yu-chi of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), who is in charge of the country’s China policy, met with his mainland Chinese counterpart Zhang Zhijun, of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office. No details of the talks have been released but it is largely seen as a move toward confidence-building and improving ties.
Previous contact between the two has been carried out through semi-official foundations or through political parties, not by government ministers. The place for the historic meeting was Nanjing, the seat of government under the Kuomintang, or Nationalist party, before a civil war with the Chinese Communists forced Nationalist forces to flee to Taiwan in 1949.
“We should both be resolute to not let cross-strait relations suffer any more twists and turns, and never let it (the relationship) go backward,” Zhang said after the meeting. 
“Being able to sit down and talk today was quite unimaginable in the past,” remarked Wang. 
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou said the visit had “extraordinary significance.” According to China‘s state news agency Xinhua, they decided to continue regular communication.
Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. The bilateral relationship has improved since Ma, of the Kuomintang, came to power in Taiwan in the 2008 elections.
