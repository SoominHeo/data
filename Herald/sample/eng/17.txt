'Service For Peace' offers intensive summer education
Service For Peace, an international voluntary service provider, held its concentrated summer program at the Olympic Parketel in Seoul. The purpose of the event was to help children develop global thinking and leadership skills through courses on international development and cooperation. 
Forty-one middle school students took part from July 19 to July 22, and 23 high school students participated from July 30 to Aug. 2. This four-day program dealt with four different global issues: poverty, the environment, illiteracy and disease. 
It included 35 hours of educational programs, including lectures, leadership courses, discussion sessions, presentations from field activists, campaign and volunteer work, a visit to Korea International Cooperation Agency’s global village and a speech contest.
 Students played games with children from Junggye and Bookboo social welfare centers at the first CGL environment culture volunteer program and learned about the seriousness of waste problems. Students also learned about the importance of protecting environment. 
The second volunteer program, called the “share, practice, happiness” campaign, took place on July 21. During the program, middle school students made soap by using recycled cooking oil and later, high school students delivered two bars of soap to each neighbor so that they could get one for themselves and give one to someone else. The recipients were nearby victims of flood damage.
