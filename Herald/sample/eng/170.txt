Koreans protest financial firms’ greed
Some 250 protesters gathered at Seoul‘s main financial district of Yeouido on Oct. 15, in a move to urge financial firms to shun its age-old greedy and risky practices.
 Following September’s “Occupy Wall Street” movement in the U.S., South Korean activists and consumers too have staged rallies in Korea. They denounced the industry’s enormous paychecks and high profit margins.
 There were around 70,000 restaurant owners who demanded lower credit card commissions on Oct. 18.
 Market watchers cautioned that financial firms should abandon excessive profit-taking practices and sharp salary rises.
