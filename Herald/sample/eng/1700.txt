Snow ball smashes into college dorm
Two students at Reed College in the United States lost control of a massive snowball, allowing it to run into a dorm room, AP reported.
Although the snowball destroyed part of a bedroom wall, there were no injuries reported, the report said.
According to AP, the two students, who majored in mathematics, tried to make the ball as big as possible, encouraged by a crowd.
The two rolled it down the sidewalk that went past the dorm. “And the ball just got away from them,” one of the onlookers said to AP.
The snowball was later chopped up by a maintenance worker. The weight was estimated to be more than 360 kg.
