Man jailed after sleeping in police car
A man from Portland in the United States was arrested after spending a night in the back of a police car, the Associated Press reported on Feb. 12.
A policeman who heard someone yell from an unattended police car went ahead and found Ruben James Turner III, who accidentally locked himself after sleeping overnight in the car, said AP.
The homeless man knew how to get in but didn’t know how to get out.
The police officer said to AP: “Once you shut that back door, you are essentially in a cage.”
Turner reportedly tried to get out of the car by writing “Help” with his finger in the condensation on the window.
