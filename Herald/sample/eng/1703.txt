Jejudo emerges as new hub for technology companies
The scenic island of Jejudo, located near the southwest end of the Korean Peninsula, is building itself a new reputation as a destination for high-tech companies. 
As a case in point, several construction projects by tech companies are underway in Jeju Science Park, a high-tech business complex located in Ara-dong, Jeju City. 
The state-run Jeju International City Development Center, or JDC, opened the park on 1.1 square kilometers of land in 2011 as one of its six mega-development projects, part of efforts to turn Jejudo into a “free international city.”
“As a first-of-its-kind business complex project on Jejudo, this is turning out to be quite a success, as about 100 knowledge-based companies have decided to move into the park,” JDC chairman Kim Han-wook said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. 
“Jejudo is appealing to creativity-driven Internet or research companies as it offers employees world-class natural assets. In addition, the island provides companies with a competitive environment for global business thanks to its geopolitical advantages of being close to China, as well as its well-developed aviation infrastructure.”
Daum Communications, the nation’s second-largest Internet portal, is one such company that decided to relocate its headquarters in Seoul to Jeju Science Park in 2012 to take advantage of the island’s offerings.
“A decade ago, the company dispatched about 30 employees to Jejudo on a pilot basis under the project name “Joyful Test” to experiment with a better work environment. Backed by the results of an employee satisfaction survey, the company finally decided to settle down on the island, relocating its head office in Seoul to Jejudo,” said Han Dong-heon, a community relations manager of Daum Communications.
Currently, about 900 of Daum’s 2,500 employees have relocated to Jejudo and are working in its brand-new architectural office building, Daum Space.1.
