5 superfoods that don’t get enough attention
As people’s wish to maintain healthy lifves and the concern for their well-being increases, the importance of superfoods has been emphasized across the world. But what exactly is a superfood? The term is used to describe foods that contain superb health benefits.
Recently, business and technology magazine Forbes reported on five healthy foods that have been overlooked. Here are the five superfoods that deserve more attention.
First is spinach. A 100 gram serving of spinach contains 52 percent of an adult’s recommended daily intake of beta carotene, 460 percent of vitamin K, 34 percent of vitamin C, 21 percent of iron and 15 percent of vitamin B6. It also contains glycoglycerolipids, which help fight against cancer.
Second, a host of studies suggest that monounsaturated fat in olive oil is good for our heart. Olive oil lowers bad cholesterol levels and increases the good ones. It is rich in antioxidants but you should be careful when adding olive oil to your diet as a tablespoon of oil contains 120 kilocalories, the same amount as in a large slice of bread and butter.
Thirdly, researchers suggest that a blueberry-rich diet helps fight diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Blueberries are packed with phytoflavinoids, potassium and vitamin C, and are anti-inflammatory. When it comes to berries, the darker the better, as darker ones carry more antioxidants. 
Fourth, eating a small handful of nuts four times a week can help reduce cardiovascular-related disease, manage Type 2 diabetes and lower cholesterol. Generally, nuts are full of essential vitamins, minerals and fiber but recent studies show that Brazil nuts that contain selenium can protect people against depression and Alzheimer's disease.
And last but certainly not least, eating oats decreases cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart disease.
