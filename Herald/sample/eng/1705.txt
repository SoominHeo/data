Center for disabled rights opens in Seoul 
In an effort to better protect the rights of Korea’s disabled population, the Seoul Metropolitan Government opened a center for the rights of citizens with disabilities in southern Seoul on Feb. 13.
According to the Seoul city government, the center will be tasked with providing legal services for the disabled as part of the measures aimed at protecting the rights of the underprivileged. 
The center, which is located in Gangnam district, is the city’s first public institution that focuses on protecting the rights of disabled people. In addition to legal assistance, the center will also be offering counseling and human rights education to anyone interested.
The city will also push to introduce a jury system for cases that involve human rights violations against the disabled. The majority of jury members will be people with disabilities and their opinions will play a large role in determining the outcome of the case. 
The city also plans to impose tougher punishments against welfare facilities involved in malpractice while also providing more support in terms of employment and job training for the disabled as part of its “five-year plan for promoting the rights of the disabled.”
"The welfare plan aims to proactively support disabled people to help them enjoy their rights without any discrimination," said Kang Jong-phil, the chief of welfare affairs. “We will put it into practice over the next five years in phases.”
This focus on the rights of disabled people comes in light of the growing demand for their protection following the release of the “The Crucible” in 2011.
What is “The Crucible”?
“The Crucible” is an unsettling film released in 2011. It is based on the true story of teachers who sexually abused disabled students repeatedly at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the hearing impaired.
