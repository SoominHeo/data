Korea’s loss of real victor
Seeing Viktor Ahn draped in the Russian flag has prompted fury in South Korea toward the country’s skating union, Reuters said in its February article.
Ahn Hyun-soo, who had won three golds at the 2006 Games, was left out of the team for Vancouver, which pushed him to leave his home and take Russian nationality.
Simmering anger over the skating union’s role in Ahn’s departure, and other coaching controversies, boiled over with his win in the 1,000 meters at the Sochi Games, said Reuters.
The article introduced Korean people's response to Ahn’s win in general. It said: “The skating union‘s website was shut down overnight due to heavy traffic as sports fans tried to vent their anger on the site.”
“Angry sports fans took to the Internet to call for the governing body to be disbanded,” the article further said.
Reuters also introduced Russian sports fans’ comments.
A 32-year-old Russian teacher said to the news: “I am glad to see Ahn smiling but somebody has got to explain why he is holding a Russian flag.”
According to Reuters, another Russian wrote on Facebook that he could not believe how Korea’s skating union had alienated an athlete whose athletic ability is rarely seen even in a span of 100 years.
