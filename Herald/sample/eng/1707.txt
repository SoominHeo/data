Girls’ Generation returns with new album
They’re back! K-pop group divas Girls’ Generation released a new mini-album titled “Mr. Mr.,” on Feb. 24, breaking a yearlong hiatus since “I Got a Boy,” which was released in January 2013. 
Prior to the official release, the group uploaded the track of “Mr. Mr.” on local online music services such as Melon, Naver Music and Genie and the girls unveiled the 40-second teaser video on their official website, YouTube and Facebook where members looking glamorous in glitzy dresses. Their blend of electronic music and hip-hop bears a repetitive, catchy hook.
“Girls’ Generation gained global popularity with ‘I Got a Boy.’ We expect the new album also will succeed in getting wide attention at home and abroad,” the group’s agency, SM Entertainment, said in a press release.
In November last year, the nine-member group received the “Video of the Year” award for “I Got a Boy” at the 2013 YouTube Awards, defeating stars like Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, One Direction and Psy. Their song took the fifth spot on Time Magazine’s Top 10 Songs of 2013 list; they were the only Asian artist to make the list. 
For the new album, Girls’ Generation collaborated with famous American music production duo the Underdogs. The RB-pop production duo composed of Harvey Mason Jr. and Damon Thomas has worked with numerous big-name performers such as Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown and Britney Spears. 
Upon the news of the new album release, Billboard’s K-town article said that it has high hopes for the group’s stellar performance this year.
