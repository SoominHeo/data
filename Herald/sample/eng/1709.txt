Kim Yu-na: my biggest rising star on Sochi
The Sochi Olympics opened on Feb. 7 in Sochi, Russia. Many people, including myself, feel excited and nervous because of the Sochi Olympics. Korea has a lot of athletes competing in this year’s Olympics, but my biggest interest is in figure skater Kim Yu-na. 
Kim Yu-na won women’s figure skating at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Here are some of the reasons why Kim Yu-na will win at Sochi, even though many prominent figure skaters will compete against her.
First, Kim Yu-na has experience of competing at the Olympic Games and she won the gold medal in her first Olympics. She said that it would not matter even if she did not win the gold medal in this year’s Olympics, but I think she will win the gold medal because she scored 78.5 on the short program and 150.06 on the free program in Vancouver in 2010. She scored 228.56 in total and set a new world record. It has not yet been broken. 
Second, Kim Yu-na’s biggest enemy in Vancouver was Kim Yu-na herself. It means that she really doesn’t have other rivals except Asada Mao of Japan. This was proved on the last Olympics in Vancouver. 
Even though Mao had a clean performance; she didn’t get the gold medal. After that, many reporters and journalists said Kim Yu-na and Asada Mao were not rivals anymore. Also, Kim won the 2013 world figure skating championship, so she will go to Sochi with Kim Hae-jin and Park So-yeon; she will feel better with her teammates this time.　
Lots of people expect good results from Kim Yu-na at the Sochi Olympics, and honestly, as her fan I really hope she wins the gold medal. But above all I hope she enjoys her last Olympics.
