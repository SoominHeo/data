Gadhafi killed in hometown
Moammar Gadhafi was killed after being cornered by Libyan fighters in his hometown of Sirte, Libya. 
An autopsy revealed that Gadhafi died from a gunshot to the head, but the exact circumstances surrounding his death are still unclear as differing accounts of his final moments have emerged. 
Libya’s ruling National Transitional Council (NTC) has said that Gadhafi was killed when a gunfight broke out between his supporters and government fighters after his capture. NTC official Abdel Majid Mlegta told Reuters that Gadhafi had died as he was being transported in an ambulance, due to the wounds he had acquired during the gunfight.
 Other accounts, however, tell a different story. Another NTC official spoke to Reuters anonymously, saying “They [NTC fighters] beat him very harshly and then they killed him. This is a war.”
