IET camp
This winter vacation, I attended an IET camp to get an instructor of English book certificate. The camp was held from Jan. 2 to Jan. 15 in Daechi-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. 
I had to complete a course on education over a long time. So, I went there at 9 a.m. and came back home at 12:30 p.m. every day. Also, to get the certificate, you must take an exam. After you get the certificate, you can serve in a country like Africa and help children who can't learn because of some unavoidable reasons in Korea. 
This class was divided into two periods, and in each period, a different teacher taught us. One teacher taught us how to be instructors and another teacher read English books with us and taught how to become a “leader” from “reading.”
We read some books and discussed them with the teachers. And we became teachers ourselves, and asked classmates questions.
Another teacher also taught us that we should not teach children but must collaborate with them.　
To spend half of the winter vacation participating in the camp was not easy, but I felt proud of myself when I passed the exam and got the certificate. If you want to feel a sense of accomplishment, why don't you challenge yourself and become an instructor? It will not be easy, but you will gain satisfaction.
