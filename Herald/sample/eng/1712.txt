Ban Ki-moon’s World Radio Day message
Feb. 13 is World Radio Day, which has been observed by all the United Nations agencies and their partners since 2012. The 13th of February was the day when the United Nations Radio was established in 1946 to promote the use of radio broadcasting for easy and cheap access to information. The following is the full text of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message delivered on this year’s World Radio Day. He particularly emphasized the need for a bigger role for women in the years to come at global broadcast organizations. -- Ed.
 "World Radio Day recognizes the unique role and impact of a medium that reaches the largest audience worldwide. This year’s observance highlights the need for radio broadcasters everywhere to promote the voice of women and to enhance the role of women within broadcast organizations. The airwaves have frequently lagged behind when it comes to gender equality. Not nearly enough women’s voices are heard -- either in front or behind the microphone. Not nearly enough stories about women and girls are being told. And women make up only a quarter of the members of the boards of the world’s media enterprises. I encourage radio stations to be more inclusive by equally recognizing women in their staff and in their audience. Radio can also help dismantle stereotypical and imbalanced programming. This is an opportunity for everyone. Let us celebrate this World Radio Day by saluting women in radio today -- and doing our utmost to nurture the new voices for tomorrow."
