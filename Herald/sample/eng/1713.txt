Tragic accident during orientation kills 10
What was meant to be a joyous, exciting event turned tragic as the roof of an auditorium at a resort in Gyeongju collapsed, killing at least 10 and injuring more than 100 during a welcoming ceremony for university freshmen on Feb. 17.
More than 1,000 incoming students at the Busan University of Foreign Studies were scheduled to attend a two-day freshman orientation event at the Mauna Ocean Resort in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. According to witnesses, 565 students were in the auditorium when it caved in at 9:15 p.m., apparently due to heavy snow. Though many of the students were able to get out of the building at the time of the collapse, some were not so lucky. 
On Feb. 18, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration confirmed the deaths of nine students and one event organizer. Two are reported to have sustained serious injuries while another 101 had minor injuries. 
“Speculation is flying over the cause of the accident, but we are looking at multiple possibilities, including heavy snow and possible flawed construction of the building,” said Lee Jae-yul, the head of Safety Management Headquarters at the Ministry of Security and Public Administration.
The tragic accident has also prompted President Park Geun-hye to convey her condolences to the victims’ families, promising a thorough investigation into the cause of the roof collapse.
“It is heartbreaking and sad to hear about the collapse that took many lives overnight,” Park said during a Cabinet meeting. “I offer words of consolation to the families of the victims, and ask for the best efforts to take care of the injured and compensation matters.”
