Rise of political outsider, Matteo Renzi 
Italy might get its youngest Prime Minister ever, as the president has asked the 39-year-old political novice Matteo Renzi, to form a new government.
 Following the resignation of the Italian Prime Minister, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has asked Matteo Renzi, the mayor of Florence, to set up a new government.
 Former prime minister Enrico Letta was ousted in a Democratic Party vote where the party members accused him of failing to tackle Italy’s chronic economic problems. 
 Italy is gambling on the young and highly ambitious Renzi, who has never been elected as a member of parliament. Renzi has promised sweeping change for the country. He told the public that in just couple of months of his inauguration, he would bring major reforms to the politics of Italy.
 He also showed his commitment to the need for urgent reform. “The most pressing emergency, which concerns my generation and others, is the emergency of labor, of unemployment and of despair," Renzi told reporters.
 However, the road to reform might not be as smooth as he hopes, because his brash and impatient manner in his rapid rise to power has earned him many enemies. Whether his popular support from the public will buy him the political space to embrace major reform is left to be seen.
 Matteo Renzi was born in Jan. 11, 1975 and graduated from University of Florence in 1999.
 He was elected Mayor of Florence in June 2009 and leader of Democratic Party in Dec. 2013.
