10-year-old boy wants to drive
A 10-year-old Norwegian boy was stopped by the police while driving for the second time in two weeks, Reuters reported on Feb. 20.
The boy, who took his parents’ car for a joyride the previous week, was driving a relative's car this time.
He drove around 30 km before being stopped by local police.
It was more dangerous in the previous incident. According to Reuters, the boy drove about 10 km after loading his 18-month-old sister into the family car, and ended up driving into a snowy ditch.
“It is scary and sad that he is allowed to keep going on like this,” a police officer told Reuters.
