A very short engagement
A wedding that took only half an hour surprised the guests, who were expecting an entirely different event.
According to the U.K.’s Mirror News on Feb. 24, it took only 30 minutes for a man to propose, lead his bride up the aisle and marry her.
Michael Clark and Fay Brazendale’s family and friends showed up for what they considered to be Fay’s 30th birthday, but suddenly Michael knelt down on the ground to propose, said Mirror News.
After accepting the proposal, Fay told the guests that the wedding would take place right then and there.
She later said that she wanted her wedding to be unusual because she had seen so many normal weddings through her job - she is a party planner.
