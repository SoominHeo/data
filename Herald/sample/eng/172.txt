Asian rickshaw race
Sixty-six people from 12 nations began a rickshaw race from Jakarta, Indonesia to Bangkok, Thailand, on Oct. 16.
 Organized by the secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a U.K.-based global adventure company, Adventurists, the rickshaw race was designed to raise money for charity and show how well-connected the nations within the region are. The race is expected to last 2 weeks, ending on Oct. 30.
 Each team set off from Jakarta in a rickshaw -- a three-wheeled vehicle with a half-horsepower engine -- with the freedom to choose which route to take to Bangkok. 
“The purpose of the rickshaw run or rally,” ASEAN Secretary General Surin Pitsuwan explained at the opening ceremony, “is to demonstrate to the ASEAN people and the people of the world that ASEAN is indeed connected.”
