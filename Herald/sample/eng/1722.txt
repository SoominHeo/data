Korea opens 2nd research base in Antarctica
Korea has opened its second research base in the icy land of Antarctica, becoming only the tenth country in the world to have at least two research bases there.
 To mark the completion of Jang Bo-go, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries held a ceremony on Feb. 12, in which participants buried a time capsule inside the base. It will be unsealed in 2044.
 The Jang Bo-go base named after a famous admiral from the country’s ancient Silla dynasty, is located near Terra Nova Bay on the southeastern tip of the Antarctic. The 4,458-square-meter base consists of 16 buildings and can accommodate up to 60 people. 
 The construction incorporated hydrodynamic design, so the buildings can withstand freezing temperatures of minus 40 degrees Celsius and winds up to 65 meters per second. The base also uses solar and wind power and heat waste from power generators to cut its use of fossil fuels, according to a Yonhap News report.
 Korea has its first Antarctic research base, King Sejong Station, on King George Island in the western part of the Antarctic. According to the ministry, the two research bases will take on separate roles. The Sejong Station will focus on the marine environment and marine life while the Jang Bo-go Station will be focusing on the continent, including the research of glaciers, meteorites and the ozone layer.
 “The Jang Bo-go station will also provide a test bed for the country's industrial, academic and research sectors for the development of new plants, equipment, robots and materials that will be used in extreme conditions,” the ministry added. 
Korea secured international approval for its second research base at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in June 2012. The construction of the second began in 2006 and cost around 104 billion won.
