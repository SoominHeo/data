‘Let It Go’ stirs up Korean music scene
Since premiering on Jan. 16, Walt Disney Animation Studio’s “Frozen” has been making local box-office history. According to the Korean Film Council, “Frozen” became the most-viewed animated film in Korea by attracting over 8 million local viewers.
Even more popular than the film itself, however, is its soundtrack. In particular, the film’s title track, “Let It Go,” has topped all of the major music charts in South Korea, a rare and remarkable feat for a foreign movie soundtrack.
“Let It Go,” sung by veteran Broadway singer-songwriter Idina Menzel, also the voice of Elsa in the movie, is essentially a powerful musical declaration by the ostracized Elsa the Snow Queen, who decides to “let go” of all her worries upon realizing that she no longer needs to hide her powerful abilities from others.
In Korea, the widespread popularity of “Let It Go” has prompted many major singers and countless regular people to produce their own cover versions of the song.
Hyolyn from the popular K-pop girl group Sistar released the official Korean version of “Let It Go,” which was included at the end of “Frozen” screenings in Korean theaters. Featuring Hyolyn’s signature husky vocals, the remade version of the song has enjoyed as much popularity in Korea as the original version.
A number of other renowned K-pop female acts have followed suit with their own unique covers of the song, including powerful vocalist Lee Hae-ri of the vocalist duo Davichi; Son Seung-yeon, the winner of South Korea’s popular singing contest show “Voice Korea”; and talented Korean-American solo vocalist Ailee.
Dia of the budding K-pop girl group KissCry as well as actress Lee Yu-bi also received heightened attention for their unique deliveries of Menzel’s song.
