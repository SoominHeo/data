Women's relay team salvages Korea’s struggling short track team in Sochi 
The South Korean women’s short track team composed of Cho Ha-ri, Kim A-lang, Park Seung-hi and Shim Suk-hee captured the country’s first short track gold medal in the women’s 3,000-meter relay at the lceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia, on Feb.19.
 They finished the 27-lap race in 4:09.498. It was also the nation’s second gold overall in the Sochi Winter Games and Korea’s 20th short track speed skating gold since the 1992 Albertville Games. 
 Canada took silver and Italy earned bronze. China finished the relay second but received a penalty for interference. 
 Until the final lap, Korea was trailing behind China, but 17-year-old prodigy Shim of Korea passed the Chinese skater in her final stretch. “As soon as my turn came, I wanted to go all out. I kept thinking to myself, ‘I can do this,’” Shim said after the game. Shim earlier won the silver medal in the women’s 1,500 meters. 
 Four years ago in the Vancouver Olympics, Korea was stripped of its gold after being penalized for an illegal overtaking maneuver. That makes this year’s gold medal that much sweeter; it was enough to mend the pain in the Vancouver event. 
 “It feels like taking the gold medal we lost four years back from China,” Park Seung-hi, who won the bronze in the ladies’ 500-meter event, said. “My teammates tried hard and did really well.”
 Park and Cho Ha-ri participated in the women’s relay team in Vancouver in 2010.
 Park Seung-hi made headlines as her two siblings - sister Park Seung-joo and younger brother Park Se-young -- are all South Korean skaters. Park is also dating Korean men’s short track skater Lee Han-bin.
