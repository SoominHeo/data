Shattering the glass ceiling in finance
The country is now led by a female president and the number of women in high positions is growing in both politics and business. 
But when it comes to banking ― an industry traditionally known for long hours and heavy workloads and at times still referred to as “no-woman territory” ― women are still scarce, especially in the higher ranks. 
That is perhaps why when Kwon Seon-joo became the chief executive officer of Industrial Bank of Korea, it came as a big surprise to many, including Kwon herself.
 “I expected women to eventually take up senior positions, but I didn’t expect I would be the one,” Kwon, who is now the first female CEO of a Korean bank, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. 
Kwon’s uniqueness does not end with her gender. Unlike many of her colleagues in banking, she chose to stay at a single workplace for more than three decades. 
“Working in a bank can be stressful but I try to be positive, and this optimism has allowed me to remain in my place,” she said. One of the challenges Kwon has brought to IBK is holding regular breakfast meetings with clients. 
“I promised myself that I would meet more customers than any other bank CEO,” Kwon said. 
 To create new business opportunities, the banker is looking toward more expansion in overseas markets.
 IBK currently has 22 overseas branches in eight countries and a network with 14 other foreign banks. The CEO said the bank was planning to establish more overseas branches and offices ― branches in China and India, as well as more offices in Indonesia and Cambodia within the year.
