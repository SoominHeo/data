‘Escape from Planet Earth’
Many dramas and movies have been based on the theme of aliens. Since the existence of aliens is one of the universe’s greatest mysteries, we are curious about them. This has led to us making up stories about people falling in love with aliens or getting into adventures in their search for the truth about aliens. However, “Escape from Planet Earth” is a brilliant movie based on the idea that aliens, abducted and taken to Earth, are responsible for developing the technology of such popular services as Google, iPhone and Facebook.
Scorch, the most beloved hero of Planet Baab, and Gary, one of the most intelligent aliens of BASA, are the Supernova brothers. One day, BASA’s chief informs the brothers of a cry for help coming from the notorious planet Earth, sending them on a mission to rescue three aliens from “Area 51.” However, contrary to what people believe, those three aliens - Io, Thurman and Doc - are brilliant alien engineers that invented the greatest technology of Earth: Google, iPhone and Facebook, respectively. They were all waiting for the day they could return to their hometown. 
However, just as they are being rescued, Scorch and Gary each find themselves caught in a trap set by the evil Shanker. Will the brothers be able to rescue the three engineers and return to their home planet? You won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen for even a second. 
There was a screening of the film on Feb. 13 at a movie theater in Myeong-dong, and everyone enjoyed the movie regardless of their age. 
This movie puts particular emphasis on brotherly affection. When we have problems, our family is always on our side, supporting us. We should be thankful for this unconditional love and spread it to our siblings and parents. I want to recommend that brothers and sisters watch this movie together and take time to think about each other.
