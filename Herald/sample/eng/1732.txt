Seoul to set up reunification preparatory committee
A plan to launch a preparatory committee for reunification tasked with building public consensus and creating a blueprint for a unified peninsula was recently revealed by President Park Geun-hye.
The announcement comes hot on the heels of the latest round of reunions between families that were separated by the outbreak of the Korean War. 
“For too long, we have suffered the pangs of separation,” said Park. “As we have witnessed through these reunions, the tragedy of separation has severed the families’ filial piety, as families are forced to deal with the bitter agony and suffering of having to part ways once again after being reunited.”
“For genuine peace and for Korea to take another great leap forward, we need to prepare to open a new era of reunification.” 
In preparation of this new era, Park spoke of a renewed commitment to laying the groundwork for reunification.
“We’d like to seek a systematic, constructive direction for reunification by launching the committee,” she added. “At it, we will embrace public opinions by inviting civilian experts and civic groups covering diplomacy, security, economy, society and culture, and map out a blueprint for a unified Korea.”
According to government data, 129,264 people have been registered as having relatives in the North. Nearly 45 percent of them have passed away, with an average of 4,000 dying each year since 2004. 
This latest round of reunions were particularly emotional for the participants, most of whom were older than 80. The reality of the situation is that this latest reunion would serve as the last time any of them would see each other unless Korea succeeds in achieving reunification in the near future.
