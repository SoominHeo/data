Pollution Beijing’s No. 1 challenge
Chinese President Xi Jinping told reporters in late February that pollution was Beijing’s biggest challenge.
 With thick smog blanketing the capital city and some of it spreading to neighboring countries, President Xi said that Beijing should ease reliance on coal and reduce vehicle use on Feb. 25.
 The president also called air pollution the “most prominent” problem Beijing faced, and went so far as to visit a busy shopping street in Beijing without wearing a mask.
 China’s National Energy Administration said in its website through an announcement that it would push to improve fuel products and strengthen coal quality management, to control pollution.
 The administration further pledged to increase the use of natural gas and to diversity away from coal.
 Meteorology experts say that smog in Beijing is at an unbearable level, and Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences pointed out that life in the city was “barely suitable.”　
 David Scowsill, president of World Travel Tourism Council, gave warning in an interview with Bloomberg that if smog stayed in the city and no proper management of the situation follows, Beijing’s tourism business will be hurt.
 China’s Xinhua News Agency reported that around 150 Chinese companies as of late February were joining to cut or suspend industrial production.
