‘Dead’ man returns to life
An American man who had been pronounced dead woke up to the family’s surprise on Feb. 27, according to the Associated Press.
Walter Williams, 78, was pronounced dead when a town coroner was called to his home by his family on Feb. 26.
Dexter Howard, the coroner, said that Williams had no pulse, and the next day Williams was sent to a nearby funeral home.
But Williams suddenly woke up, and his family and the coroner reunited at a hospital near the funeral home.
Howard said Williams’ pacemaker seemed to have started again, and Williams greeted his family by saying that he was happy to be alive.
Average salary for Korean baseball players hits record high
For the first time in Korea’s baseball history, the average salary for professional baseball players in Korea has surpassed the 100 million won mark, the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) announced recently.
According to the KBO, the average salary for the 477 local professional baseball players is slated to hit a record 106.4 million won (just under $100,000) for the 2014 season, discounting foreign and rookie players. Compared to the previous year’s record of 95.17 million won, the salaries have risen a whopping 11.8 percent. 
Of the total 477 baseball players, 136 athletes (28.5 percent) will receive salaries that exceed 100 million won. Compared to the first year that Korea’s professional league kicked off in 1982, the athletes’ annual salaries have seen a more than sevenfold increase.
It is interesting to note, however, that this record-high average salary for professional baseball players in Korea is nothing more than chump change compared to the average salaries of their counterparts in the U.S. or Japan. 
For example, while the average salary of Korean professional baseball players in 2013 was approximately $89,345, their American counterparts were earning $3.39 million (3.61 billion won) on average. In Japan, Nippon Professional Baseball players were paid an average of 37.33 million yen ($370,000) during the same period. 
 Currently under contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ryu Hyun-jin’s salary in 2013 was a jaw-dropping $3.3 million (3.6 billion won).
 Highest paid players: 
Korea - Kim Tae-gyun (Hanhwa Eagles) / Reported salary for 2014: 1.5 billion won ($1.4 million)
U.S. - Zack Greinke (Los Angeles Dodgers) / Reported salary for 2014: $26 million 
Japan - Shinnosuke Abe (Yomiuri Giants) / Reported salary for 2014: 600 million yen ($5.87 million)
