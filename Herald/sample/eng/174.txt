The College Board
A not-for-profit membership association representing more than 5,900 colleges, universities and schools, the College Board was created in 1900 to expand access to higher education in the United States. Initially formed by a handful of colleges, the purpose was to simplify the application process for students and college admission offices by providing one, universal and standardized test. The College Board created the SAT in 1926 to replace the outdated College Entrance Examination Board.
