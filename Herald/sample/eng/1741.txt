K-pop artists’ different pockets of popularity
Much like different K-pop groups result in the creation of distinctively different fan clubs, it seems different countries have also taken sides.
A survey conducted by CJ EM found that K-pop artists seem to have established pockets of popularity in different countries. Approximately 5 million people from 178 nations participated in the survey through “M Wave” (mwave.interest.me), an online poll for the cable network music show, M Countdown. The poll, which was held from January to December 2013, asked participants to pick their favorite K-pop singers.
An analysis of the results by CJ EM found that girl group f(x) had the most global appeal with 16.4 percent of votes, thanks in large part to their Chinese fan base.
K-pop boy band Shinhwa won 15.1 percent of the votes and SS501 leader Kim Hyun-joong took 9.3 percent, placing them second and third respectively, followed by EXO and SHINee. EXO won the most votes from the U.S., Canada and Korea; whereas Kim Hyun-joong ruled in Japan and SHINee’s popularity resonated most in Europe, Mexico and Argentina.
CJ EM said K-pop popularity levels were most diversified in the Asian continent, where different countries had different favorite K-pop stars. 
Among the Asian countries, f(x) was most popular in China, Kim Hyun-joong in Japan, and boy band FT Island was most popular in Taiwan. Girl group 2NE1 came top in the Philippines, EXO in India and Super Junior member Henry in Saudi Arabia. 
“Foreign fans have different preferences for K-pop stars according to their national characteristics and the K-pop artists’ activities in their countries,” Seo Jeong-min, a global operation senior official at CJ EM, was quoted as saying. He went on to add that such analyses can be helpful in developing future promotion strategies for K-pop stars
