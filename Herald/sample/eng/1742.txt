Korean National Ballet opens season with ‘La Bayadere’
The Korean National Ballet, which welcomed its new artistic director, famed ballerina Kang Sue-jin in February, is opening its 2014 season with Marius Petipa’s “La Bayadere.”
It is the first ballet that Kang will stage since her appointment this year.
The upcoming production will be accompanied by the Korean Symphony Orchestra, conducted by special guest Judith Yan. 
Yan is the artistic director of a symphony orchestra in Canada, and it is the first time she has conducted an orchestra for the Korean National Ballet. Yan is a close friend of Kang’s.
