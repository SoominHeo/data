‘Diana’ illustrates last years of people’s princess
“Diana,” a biopic about the Princess of Wales, deals with the personal turmoil of the late princess, whose marriage to Prince Charles of the United Kingdom, acrimonious divorce and fashion style made her one of the biggest icons of the 20th century.
 The film shares the last two years of Diana’s life after her divorce from Prince Charles in 1995. Australian actress Naomi Watts successfully pulled off playing Princess Diana, mimicking her British accent and signature style. 
 Diana was not happy both in the family she was born into and in her high-profile marriage. As an escape, she sought intimacy in extra-marital relationships. She had affairs with English-Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Ahmad Khan and Egyptian heir Dodi Fayed, who died with her in a car crash in 1997.
 The film features Diana’s charity and humanitarian work, including her visit to Africa to raise awareness about land mines. The princess instantly engages with victims there.
 The movie is quite enjoyable to watch, as it gives a glimpse of “the world’s most photographed woman.” In the film, Watts donned a number of gowns that were almost identical to the iconic dresses of the late princess. Jacques Azagury, Princess Diana’s favorite designer for red carpet events in the last five years of her life, created garments for the movie.
 “Diana” offers glimpse of the life of the tragic icon of the 20th century.
 It opened nationwide on March 6.
