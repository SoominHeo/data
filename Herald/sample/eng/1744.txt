Kim Yu-na, you were the queen!
A domestic poll conducted after the Sochi Winter Olympics showed that Kim Yu-na was the most memorable performer among all the South Korean athletes there.
 The survey of 606 South Koreans was taken by Korea Gallup on Feb. 24 and 25, and 55 percent of the respondents said they were most impressed by Kim’s flawless performance during short and free skate programs.
 About 70 percent said they watched the figure skating events most attentively to see “Queen Yu-na” performing.
 It was not only Korean fans who were shocked when Kim lost the gold medal to Russia’s Adelina Sotnikova.
 Katarina Witt of Germany, who won consecutive Olympic titles in the 1980s, said after the women’s figure skating events: “I am stunned by this result. I don’t understand the scoring.”
 Kurt Browning, a former world champion, also told The New York Times that he was confused when Sotnikova won and that he couldn’t understand how Yu-na and Sotnikova were so close in the components.
 Nevertheless, the Korean skater who had her last competition as a professional skater at Sochi games did not blame others but said she was satisfied with her last game.
 “A lot of different feelings were coming to me. The biggest feeling was that I felt relieved it was over,” Kim said to reporters.
 When asked about whether she was surprised at the final scores, Kim said it was a matter for the judges. She added she was not in the right position to comment and there was nothing that would change with her words.
 As to the plans after Sochi Olympics, Kim said she had a performance in May to prepare for and other busy schedule back in Korea. But after that, she said, she has no particular plans but just wants to rest for a while.
