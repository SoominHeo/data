Thomas Edison’s light bulb
I think Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb is his most important invention. This is because it lit up houses and because light bulbs were safer than candles, which could cause a fire. Nowadays, light bulbs can be cheaply mass-produced, and are used to illuminate almost every house in the world.
 In the 19th century, there were not many ways to light up the city or towns at night. People had to use fires like campfires or candles. These could burn down houses and other places. 
 However, light bulbs are safe and reliable sources of light that do not pose a fire risk. Light bulbs are powered by electricity, and the coil inside could pop, but would barely do any damage. Also, a light bulb is not as hot as an open fire. Therefore, light bulbs are safer than fire. 
 Finally, light bulbs can be made quickly, cheaply and easily. Unlike candles, light bulbs are made of common items like glass and wire, so they take less time to make. 
 Since light bulbs are safe, cheap and portable, the invention of the light bulb is recognized as one of Edison’s greatest inventions. I think it is one of the greatest inventions of all time.
