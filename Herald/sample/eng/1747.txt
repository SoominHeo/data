Thomas Edison’s greatest invention
Thomas Edison has left many useful inventions for us. He is known to have dreamed up more than 1,000 inventions. However, his most famous invention is inarguably the light bulb.
 The light bulb is a convenient tool used to create light from electricity, not fire. However, there was a big problem whilst inventing it. The most important part of a light bulb is the filament. Nowadays, thanks to the development of science, there are many materials that can glow with heat for a long time without burning away. However, in the old days, there was barely any appropriate material for the filament. 
 Thomas Edison is known to have tested over a thousand different materials in order to invent the light bulb, and this is why I think that the light bulb is his most renowned invention. Today, we can all live comfortably because of light bulbs. Can you imagine a life without electric lighting, and having to light your room with candles? I can’t. I think that the light bulb is the cleverest tool related to electricity.
