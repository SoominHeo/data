Foreign Minister address U.N. on ‘comfort women’
Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Yun Byung-se delivered a keynote speech on March 5 at the United Nations meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. It was the first time a top Korean diplomat raised the “comfort women” issue and criticized Japan by name at the U.N. Below is part of the minister’s speech on the issue. -- Ed.
 “The prevalent sexual violence in armed conflicts even in this century is largely attributable to the culture of impunity and the failure in ensuring accountability. 
“The victims of wartime sexual slavery drafted by the Japanese imperial armed forces, the so-called ‘comfort women,’ are the evidence in point. This is not only a bilateral issue between Japan and other victimized countries -- including Korea, China, the Netherlands, and various Southeast Asian countries -- but also it is a universal human rights issue, an unresolved problem still haunting us today.
“Just two days ago, a high-ranking official of the Japanese government responsible for the education of the next generation claimed that the comfort women issue is a fabricated story.
“This is an added insult to the honor and dignity of those victims who had weathered physical and psychological pain (from their) lifelong haunted memories. Such an attitude is an affront to humanity and disregards the historical truth. 
“I sincerely hope that the Republic of Korea and Japan, sharing common values and interest, will be able to make joint contributions toward the peace and prosperity of Northeast Asia and beyond.”
