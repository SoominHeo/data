Italy to create rescue fund to restore Pompeii 
New cash will arrive to protect degraded Pompeii, according to the Italian government. 
 It says it will pump in 2 million euros in emergency funding to the ancient city, after the recent flooding and heavy rainfall wreaked havoc on the area.
 The abject situation in the historic site, where scores of structures, including the Temple of Venus and Roma were damaged, called for swift action from the European Union (EU) and the United Nations.
 The EU has already provided a substantial amount of money for the restoration of the site. Yet, Italian media said that its government was too slow to commit to the efforts. They also claimed that the government’s bureaucracy and mismanagement of the funds aggravated the site’s poor condition. 
 “Pompeii is emblematic not only for Europe, but also for the world,” Johannes Hahn, the EU’s Regional Policy Commissioner, said. 
 Pompeii is a Roman city that was smothered by volcanic ash from an eruption in A.D. 79. It is one of the world’s greatest archaeological treasures and a World Heritage site designated by the U.N. cultural organization, UNESCO. The place is a popular tourist destination; some 2.5 million tourists visit the city every year. 
 At an emergency meeting, Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini pledged that the government will take steps to protect vulnerable areas of the site. 
 He added the EU could be “sure that Italy is taking care of Pompeii, both in terms of emergency measures and in the long term.”
