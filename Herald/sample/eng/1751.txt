Doctors’ association goes on strike
On March 10, thousands of doctors in Korea went on strike to protest against the government’s controversial plan to introduce telemedicine services and for-profit subsidiaries as part of its health care reforms.
The Korean Medical Association (KMA) had announced earlier on March 1 that the strike would proceed when 77 percent of 48,861 doctors across the country voted in support of a proposal to strike. 
“My heart is heavy as this vote appears to illustrate desperation among our members,” KMA chief Roh Hwan-kyu said.
A strike committee was launched shortly after the announcement and the walkout plans were finalized on March 3. A full one-day strike took place on March 10, which will be followed by a scheduled six-day strike starting March 24. Although the March 10 strike allowed for emergency room and intensive care center workers to continue working, the six-day strike will have no such exceptions. 
During the six day strike, doctors will be limiting their medical services to 15 minutes per patient and medical residents will only work for eight hours a day.
“The strike is an expression of doctors’ strong will to deter the government’s push for telemedicine and for-profit policies, and to fundamentally reform the abnormal health care system,” KMA said. 
Doctors have expressed concerns that the new government measures would lower the quality of medical services while stimulating the privatization of the medical sector. The government, on the other hand, claims that the measures would provide greater convenience for patients while simultaneously attracting more investment for hospitals.
