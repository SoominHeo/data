Baby crocodile spotted at construction site
Street cleaners discovered a baby African crocodile at a construction site in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, UPI news said March 7.
Once the 50-centimeter-long crocodile was collected by the cleaners, it was placed in an aquarium in the cityâ€™s public utility office and given some fresh food, according to the report.
The office workers reportedly asked the St. Petersburg Zoo to take care of the animal, but the zoo officials refused to accept it, saying that they do not have the proper resources to care for the species, which can grow to as long as five meters.
