A senior Polish politician stepped down from his position after a racially offensive outburst at a German airport, news reports said on March 5.
Jacek Protasiewics, a member of Poland’s ruling party, got into an argument at Frankfurt Airport after drinking two bottles of wine onboard a flight from Warsaw to the German city.
