Five health benefits of milk
Doctors are divided on the health benefits of drinking milk -- some talk highly of its positive effects while others warn of hidden dangers. To put forward one side of the topic, a research team with Medical News Today rounded up five beneficial effects of milk.
 1. Bone health
 Milk is rich in both calcium and vitamin D. Calcium’s primary job is the development and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth, while vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium. 
 2. Blood pressure and heart health
Calcium, the primary mineral in milk, also helps reduce the risk of vasodilation and lower blood pressure. It is important for blood clotting, wound healing, maintaining normal blood pressure and muscle contractions. Milk is also full of potassium, which can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. A study showed that those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium per day had a 49 percent lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease compared to those who consumed about 1,000 mg per day.
 3. Cancer
Research suggests that vitamin D might play a role in cancer protection. Other studies suggest that increased intake of calcium and lactose from dairy products may help prevent ovarian cancer.
 4. Depression
 A fair level of vitamin D can support the production of serotonin, a hormone associated with mood, appetite and sleep. A lack of vitamin D has been reportedly associated with depression and chronic fatigue.
 5. Muscle building and weight loss
 A good amount of muscle is necessary for supporting metabolism and contributing to weight loss and weight maintenance. According to health magazine Today’s Dietician, an increased milk intake can boost muscle mass and strength during resistance exercise in both younger and older adults.
