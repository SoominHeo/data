Why do people quit their jobs?
Regardless of the unemployment rate, many people choose to quit their jobs every day for any number of reasons. While some may have very unique, personal reasons for tendering their resignations, many others do so for the following popular reasons. 
In Korea, a recent survey by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) found that marriage, rather than childrearing, was the leading cause of women quitting their jobs. 
While many would assume that childrearing would play a bigger role in a woman’s decision to quit her job than her marital status, the results of the FKI survey say otherwise. Based on a poll of 5,887 women nationwide, the likelihood of married women with children giving up work was only 2.9 percent higher than married women without kids. In contrast, married women are 37.8 percent more likely to quit than those who remained single.
In a different survey comparing job changes in high school graduates and college graduates in Korea, the survey found that the biggest reason for seeking other employment was salary-related. The No. 1 cited reason for quitting their previous job was “the wages were too low,” followed by “my prospects for this company are gloomy,” “poor working conditions” and “the work wasn’t right for me.” 
On the other hand, a survey conducted by Benchmark Recruit, a recruitment company based in the United Kingdom, found that the having a lack of faith in the leadership team was the biggest cause for people to turn in their resignation. The same survey found that 19 percent of the over 3,000 surveyed considered their job “dead-end” while 25 percent considered their jobs to be “perfect.”
