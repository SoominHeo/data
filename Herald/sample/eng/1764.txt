Korea beats Greece in pre-World Cup match
The South Korean national soccer team beat Greece in a pre-World Cup friendly at Karaiskakis Stadium in Greece on March 3.
 The final score of the match was 2-0, with Korea’s forward Park Chu-young and striker Son Heung-min each scoring a goal. 
 For Park, it was his first international goal in more than two years. Park now has 24 international goals under his belt. 
 In the 18th minute of the first half of the game, Park took a floating ball from Son from the left wing and calmly put it past the Greek goalkeeper with his golden left foot. On top of that, in the 54th, Koo Ja-cheol set up a chance for Son and Son scored the second goal with his left foot.
 Despite the fact that Korea won, its defense and forward line were rather shaky. But it was apparent that Greece was unable to take advantage of these weaknesses, hitting the post once and the crossbar twice in the first half of the game.
 Since last June, when coach Hong Myung-bo took the helm of the team, the South Korean national soccer team has had five wins, six losses and three draws.
 After the match, Hong said that he wanted to congratulate and thank his players for a job well done in a challenging environment.
 “The players responded well to what we’d prepared for over the past two days here,” Hong said. “Scoring two goals is the most positive thing we take away from this victory.”
 Hong was also happy with Park’s performance. “He had no problem fitting in with the rest of the team.”
 The latest win is a boost for Team Korea as it prepares for this June’s 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
