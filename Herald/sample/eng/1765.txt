Figure skater Kim Yu-na confirms she is dating
Korea’s figure skating icon Kim Yu-na is dating a hockey player, Kim’s agency, All That Sports confirmed on March 6. 
 “Most of what was reported is true, and (Kim Yu-na) is dating Kim Won-jung,” the agency stated.
 Before her agency confirmed the report, online tabloid Dispatch, which boasts of its exclusive paparazzi shots of the nation’s top celebrities, claimed her romantic relationship. The news instantly went viral on local news media, indicating the amount of attention and affection for Kim.
 According to the report, Kim first met Kim Won-jung, a 29-year-old hockey player for the Korean military hockey club Daemyung Sangmu in July 2012. He was the strongest contributor in getting his team into the Asia League Ice Hockey playoffs in 2013 and 2014, and was the star of its 2013 Ice Hockey championship win. The two began dating in August.
 Not only they are skaters representing Korea, they have a lot more in common, added the report. Both attended Korea University and had a hard time recovering from injuries as professional athletes. While preparing for her last Olympics, Kim suffered from metatarsal injury and Kim Won-jung offered Yu-na a shoulder to lean on. 
 Kim Yu-na retired from international figure skating for good after grabbing a silver medal at the Sochi Winter Olympics last month. Her winning the silver medal instead of the gold provoked immense controversy at home and abroad, as a Russian skater appeared to have won the gold thanks to a lopsided home advantage.
