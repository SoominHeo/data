N.K. leader’s younger sister Kim Yo-jong
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s younger sister appears to have made her debut on the political stage. 
 Kim Yo-jong, 26, accompanied her brother on his trip to a polling station in Pyongyang for an election of the Supreme People’s Assembly on March 9, state media reported. 
 The move was likely to help consolidate Kim Jong-un’s grip in the wake of the December execution of his powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek, which reignited concerns of a fierce power struggle and instability within the 2-year-old regime. 
 “We believe this was the first time that she appeared in a state media report by name,” Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do told a news briefing. “There has not been much official activity by her so far.” 
 Kim Yo-jong is the youngest daughter of late strongman Kim Jong-il and was born to Ko Yong-hui, his third wife and the mother of the incumbent ruler. 
 TV footage showed her wearing a ponytail and a black skirt suit, walking behind her brother and casting her ballot at Kim Il-sung University of Politics. 
 Though her title was not made public, experts predict that Kim Yo-jong could be a deputy director, which is equivalent to vice minister in the South. She had reportedly been in charge of public events at an executive office within the party. 
 Kim Yo-jong was previously seen at the funeral of her late father in December 2011, standing in the front row beside her brother and other core military and party officials, even though she was not listed as a funeral committee member. She has since appeared at some onsite inspections and other outings alongside her brother.
