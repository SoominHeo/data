Adorable children in entertainment TV programs
After the end of the very successful first season of “Dad! Where are you Going?” the fathers featured on the program said in an interview that they were very worried at first, but were surprised to find how loved their children were by the viewers. 
I couldn’t take my eyes off the children either. As “Dad! Where are you Going?” became more popular, other channels started to make similar programs with different parents and children. The other programs, which frequently became hot topics, are “Superman Returns” and “Oh my Baby.” Looking at these three programs, I began to think about why they are so popular. 
The most obvious reason is because of the children. The children’s cute faces and adorable behavior make viewers smile, laugh and forget about all of the complicated problems of reality. In particular, Chu Sa-rang, the daughter of mixed martial arts fighter Chu Sung-hoon from “Superman Returns,” often becomes a hot topic for being such a lovely baby. 
Fathers and the other people who look after the children also play a role in the popularity. Although mothers generally tend to take care of the children, the programs show fathers and other people looking after them. They provide a refreshing, new look at childrearing, and show the people who look after them as surprised and exhausted, not knowing what to do with the messes the children made. This always gives viewers a big laugh. 
In my opinion, the popularity of “Dad! Where are you going?” “Superman Returns,” “Oh my Baby” and other similar programs featuring children is due to the cast members, especially the children.
