Keeping the tourism industry alive in Korea
According to Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, more than 12 million foreign tourists visited Korea last year. There was also a change in the places that tourists visited; a shift from traditional sights to places where they can have more multicultural experiences. The statistics showed that foreign tourists are beginning to stay longer and spend more money in Korea. What should we do to keep this going?
First, we will have to relieve them of their difficulties. There needs to be more malls and accommodations that specialize in providing services for foreigners. Half of the foreign tourists visiting Korea pointed out that difficulties with communication should be addressed as soon as possible. Solving this problem by making specialized malls and accommodations for foreigners should allow for Korea to attract more tourists and make them stay longer.
Next, we need to pay more attention to their interests. The places foreign tourists visit are changing. The number of foreign tourists visiting traditional sights has decreased by 10 percent, but places such as the area around Hongik University, Apgujeong and Sinsa-dong are attracting an increasing number of tourists. In order to attract more tourists, communities will have to invest more in the promotion of these places.
A tourist is a person who is visiting a place for pleasure and interest. More tourists means more people coming in for pleasure. That is what’s happening in Korea. In order to vitalize the tourism industry, we will have to satisfy the tourists’ expectations. We’ll have to understand where they are going, relieve them of their difficulties, and try to provide them with the best environment possible for their vacations.
