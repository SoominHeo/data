Will Galaxy Nexus be a call for iPhone 4S?
Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy Nexus smartphone on Oct. 19, seeking to gain the upper hand in the fierce global smart phone market, Yonhap News reported.
 Recently, Apple snatched temporary sales bans on Samsung‘s Galaxy Tab tablet computer in Germany and Australia. The former accused the latter of copying the screen multi-touch features and “heuristic” capabilities from its iPads and iPhones. According to the report, multi-touch features allow users to zoom in and out using two fingers and heuristic capabilities allow users to turn the page on the display. With the measure, Samsung will miss out on the opportunity to sell its Galaxy line smart devices during the pivotal holiday season.
 As a counterattack, Samsung refurbished itself with two golden plans, said Yonhap News. First, the company asked judges in Japan and Australia to temporarily postpone the sales of the iPhone 4S. Samsung’s claim was that Apple violated its mobile and user interface patents. 
 The release of a new smartphone, Galaxy Nexus was the second move made by the South Korean conglomerate against its rival, Apple. The company calls the product the result of Samsung and Google’s coordinated efforts. According to Yonhap News, the Galaxy Nexus is mounted with a new version of the Android system called “Ice Cream Sandwich.” 
 Shin Jong-kyun, the mobile chief of Samsung Electronics Co., asserted that the company would shrug off potential legal attacks from Apple with the new gadget.
 “Now we will avoid everything we can and take patents very seriously,” Shin told reporters Oct. 18 on the eve of the Galaxy Nexus’ launch. 
 Amid the ongoing legal battles, Lee Jae-yong, chief operating officer of Samsung Electronics, attended the memorial service of Steve Jobs on Oct. 19 in California. He met Apple’s new chief, Tim Cook, and sought the two companies’ long-term cooperation.
