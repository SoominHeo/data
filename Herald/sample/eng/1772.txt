Dokdo-themed miniature garden to go on global exhibit 
A Dokdo-themed miniature garden will soon be embarking on an international exhibition tour after being showcased at the Strand Gallery in London from March 6-8. 　
Designed by Hwang Ji-hae and entitled “A Letter Posted a Million Years Ago,” the downscaled garden features imitations of plants that grow naturally only on Dokdo and Ulleungdo in the East Sea. According to Hwang, the artwork of indigenous Korean flora was presented to emphasize Korean sovereignty over the contentious islet.
“The island of Dokdo is home not just to migratory birds, but also to wild flowers and plants. Some of them exist only on the tiny island. Dokdo is not only beautiful and magnificent but also possesses the mysterious markings of the passage of time and the laws of nature,” Hwang said.
The only Asian designer among the 10 garden designers invited to participate in the miniature garden show in London, Hwang’s design will embark on a tour around the world, visiting the Netherlands, Sweden, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Denver and New Delhi. The exhibition will grow as new contributors will be added from each of the countries visited. 
Hwang has won several awards during her career, including the President’s Award for “Quiet Time: DMZ Forbidden Garden,” her garden design depicting the tension and conflict in the demilitarized zone on the border between South and North Korea. She also won a gold medal for her Korean toilet-themed garden, “Hae Woo So: Emptying Your Mind” at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2011.
