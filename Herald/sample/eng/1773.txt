New flag for New Zealand?
New Zealand is poised to hold a referendum on whether to change its national flag, according to the country’s Prime Minister John Key. 
 Calling on an election for Sept. 20 during a speech at Victoria University on March 11, Key added that the country’s current flag bears anachronistic symbolism. 
 The current flag includes the Southern Cross constellation and has the Union Jack -- the UK’s national flag -- in one corner of it. It represents the post-colonial era of the country under the United Kingdom, he said. This is the past that New Zealand had moved on from, added Key.
 “It’s my belief ... that the design of the New Zealand flag symbolizes a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed. The flag remains dominated by the Union Jack in a way that we ourselves are no longer dominated by the United Kingdom,” stated the Prime Minister.
 “I am proposing that we take one more step in the evolution of modern New Zealand by acknowledging our independence through a new flag,” he added.
 Key also suggested that he liked the option of adding silver fern -- which symbolizes the country’s national sports teams including the All Blacks rugby team -- to the national flag. He claimed that the silver fern on a black background gives a distinctive and uniquely New Zealand identity.
 However, one poll late last month showed only 28 percent of New Zealand people supported changing the flag, compared to 72 percent who were happy with the current one.
