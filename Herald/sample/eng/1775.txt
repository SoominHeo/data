Croatian city to close zoo 
Crotia's second-largest city, Split, will close its zoo.
The zoo has been described as “worst in the world.”
The notorious place was infamous among the local people for its “small, dirty cages and poor conditions overall.” 
Appalled visitors criticized the zoo heavily on the website tripadvisor.com.
Comments included: “This zoo is an utter disgrace. I do not get how it is still open,” “All in all, a terrible experience,” and “It is monstrous.”
The zoo will be turned into a park with animals, a playground and a botanic garden, according to city officials.
