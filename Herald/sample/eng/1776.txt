Chihuahua and robber
A man from Arizona in the U.S. appeared at a bank with his Chihuahua as he tried to rob the place.
UPI News said on March 17 that the man was able to get away with a lot of money.
According to the report, the man walked into Chase Bank in Tucson while carrying a shopping basket that carried his Chihuahua.
He walked up to the teller, demanded cash and finally left the bank, but he did not use his dog to threaten the bank employees.
