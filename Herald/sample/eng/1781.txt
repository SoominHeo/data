Unified Korea would have 8th-largest economy: think tank
In the event that the two Koreas were to unify within the next year, Korea would have the world’s eighth-largest economy by 2050, according to a recent report by a local think tank.
Hyundai Research Institute (HRI) claimed that a unified Korea would have a combined population of about 74 million with a per capita income exceeding Japan’s by 2050. 
The reunification of the two Koreas would also lead to the creation of new growth engines and a sizeable domestic market, which could work to alleviate the country’s reliance on overseas markets. 
“The increase in population and market would make it possible to deal effectively with the drop in economic growth potential and the country’s weakness to external economic developments,” said Hong Soon-jick, head of the HRI’s unification economy center.
Hong added that if unification were to be achieved, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the two Koreas would top $1.64 trillion in 2015, growing to $2.07 trillion in 2020 before hitting $3.28 trillion just 10 years later. This means that by 2050, a unified Korea would have surpassed the GDP of Germany and Britain to become No. 8 in the world. 
Although social tensions may rise in the immediate aftermath of reunification -- especially due to the need to restructure the North’s run-down infrastructure -- the senior researcher emphasized that in the end, the benefits of a unified country far outweigh the costs. 
Experts say this is particularly true when it comes to Korea’s defense spending. South Korea currently spends 2.9 percent of its GDP on defense, but if the two Koreas were to unite, that number could be gradually decreased to as low as 1.4 percent by 2027. Cutting back on defense spending would also help to create funds that could be used for other means, such as conducting research on North Korea’s bountiful natural resources.
