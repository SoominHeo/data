Oprah Winfrey sells studios
U.S. TV personality Oprah Winfrey is selling the studios that she has used for over 20 years.
Harpo Studios in Chicago was used from 1990 to 2011 for the Oprah Winfrey Show.
Although the studios are being sold to a developer, they will remain on the property for another two years, according to news reports.
It was in 2011 when she started the Oprah Winfrey Network on cable.
Winfrey, who is sometimes known as the “queen of all media,” has been ranked the richest African-American of the 20th century.
She was born into poverty in Mississippi to a single mother and raised in Milwaukee.
She landed a job in radio while still a high school student and began anchoring an evening news show at the age of 19.
She came to Chicago in 1984 to host the morning talk show "A.M. Chicago."”
A month later, the show was ranked No. 1 in the market and renamed "The Oprah Winfrey Show"“ in 1985.
She moved the set in 1990 to Harpo Studios. The city later renamed a nearby street as "Oprah Winfrey Way."
