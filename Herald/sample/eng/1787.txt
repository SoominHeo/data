My health during this winter vacation
I have been interested in my health for a long time because my lifelong aim is to sustain my health forever. But lots of stress and irregular eating habits have degraded my health. So, before going to high school I decided to try my “healthiest week.”
 First, I started every morning with green juice. Actually, until this week in the winter vacation, I really didn’t want to drink carrot or vegetable juice because I thought they might taste bad. But, I tried because it’s good for my health. Then, I noticed that carrots are really sweet! So, I drank kale-carrot-beet juice every morning. It really smells like chocolate juice. Anyway, I really want to sustain this habit because this juice energizes me. 
 And, another project was to start “no fast food” week. Even though I don’t enjoy fast food, I spend a lot of time eating out, so it’s hard to avoid it. But this winter vacation, I ate at home or packed organic food and took it with me.
 After this, many things have changed. This lifestyle caused my acne to disappear. I was so happy about that. Also, surprisingly, I could study more efficiently. This is my last winter vacation in middle school and I didn’t do anything special like going on a trip or going to a camp. But I spent a lot of time thinking about my lifestyle and getting ready for high school. So it was worth it.
