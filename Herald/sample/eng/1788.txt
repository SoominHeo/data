Improvements needed in our tourism industry
Korea’s tourism industry is growing bigger and bigger. According to some statistics, the annual number of foreign tourists in Korea has reached over 10 million. The increase of Chinese tourists played a big role in this. But, there are still a lot of complaints from these tourists about things such as traffic congestion, forced purchases and communication problems. To improve our tourism industry, we need to fix these problems.
 The most important thing is that we need to reduce prejudice against foreigners. If we have a biased view about foreigners, we would treat them differently from Korean people without realizing it. This might make them feel discriminated against. Also, prejudices are mostly not correct, and this means that we might not know the truth of the foreigners and treating them in the wrong way. For example, some people think that Chinese people are dirty. This isn’t true, but if they have this idea in their mind, they would try to avoid Chinese people and keep away from them.
 Another thing is that we should never mistreat foreigners. Actually, a lot of Koreans ignore and mistreat foreigners because they don’t speak Korean well. For example, some people might trick foreign tourists into paying more money for goods and hotels. Even if foreigners do not understand our language well, they still can read the emotions in the conversation and spread their bad feelings about Korea online. We should be careful to prevent these things from happening, because words on social networking sites spread fast, and they can bring a decline in the number of tourists coming to Korea.
