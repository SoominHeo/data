 I want to thank you for welcoming me to Kiev on such short notice.
This is my second visit to Ukraine as secretary-general. While I am pleased to be here, I come to Kiev with a heavy heart. 
These are some of the most dramatic and difficult times in the history of Ukraine. 
Tensions are high.
Lives have been lost. I express my deepest condolences to the families who have lost loved ones.
I am very seriously concerned at both the tense situation within parts of your country and between Ukraine and Russia.
As secretary-general of the United Nations, it is my responsibility and duty to do my utmost to promote international peace and security.
Yesterday, as you know, I was in Moscow where I met with President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov. I conveyed to him the same consistent messages I have been repeating since the beginning of the crisis.
This current crisis can only be resolved through peaceful diplomatic solutions based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, including respect for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and a determined statesmanlike pursuit of peace and security.
