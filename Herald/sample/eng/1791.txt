Paris restricts car use to tackle air problem
The country is known for its free spirit and ideas, but France has imposed major restrictions on its people for the first time in 20 years to control air pollution.
 After the city’s air pollution hit record highs on March 17, the French government imposed a strict ban on car use in the capital. 
 Only vehicles with odd-numbered number plates were allowed to drive in Paris on March 17. Those with even-numbered vehicles received a 22 euro ($30) fine when they were caught by hundreds of police who keenly monitored traffic. Police report showed that nearly 4,000 people by midday on March 17 received tickets.
 Meanwhile taxis, commercial electric and hybrid vehicles and cars carrying three or more passengers were exempted from the regulation. Also, public transport was offered for free to encourage citizens to leave their cars at home and take the bus or metro instead.
 The capital’s air quality has been one of the worst on record, exceeding safe levels, according to the French Environment Ministry. Lately, pollution levels hit 180 micrograms of PM10 particulates per cubic meter, more than double the safe limit of 80. The level rivaled the Chinese capital, Beijing, notorious for its air pollution.　
 A similar measure was tried once before, in 1997, and it had a noticeable impact on improving air quality, said Paris air quality monitoring body Airparif.
