No more car emissions on Jeju Island
The popular tourist destination of Jeju Island is planning on becoming zero car emissions zone by 2030. Although pollution is caused by more than just car emissions, Jeju Island is clearly taking the first steps towards saving the Earth.
Jeju Island is planning on achieving this zero car emissions goal by trying to make sure all of the islandâ€™s vehicles run on electricity by 2030. Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained increasing popularity over the years and the government of Jeju Island is using this to their advantage. 
Not only is Jeju Island trying to increase the number of EVs, it is also trying to increase the number of EV charging stations. Currently, there are about 360 EVs and 497 charging stations on the island. In order to achieve its 2030 goal, Jeju Island is looking to increase the number of EVs by more than 500 and the number of charging stations by 521 by the end of 2014. 
Although Seoul has more EVs registered overall, Jeju Island has a fivefold advantage over the capital city in terms of the ratio between EVs and non-electric vehicles. 
The ambitious goal of becoming a zero car emissions island by 2030 has gained a lot of support, especially in light of the first International Electric Vehicle Expo (IEVE) that was held on Jeju Island from March 15-21. Officials supporting the IEVE claim that Jeju Island is the ideal location for EVs because a full trip around the island is only 180 kilometers long.
