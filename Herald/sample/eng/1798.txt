Crossing river in plastic bag
A Vietnamese man was caught on camera wrapping a teenage girl in plastic to move her to the opposite side of a river on March 21.
The girl is one of many who used plastic to cross the stream, which takes about 2 minutes.
After the video clip went viral, the Vietnamese government has pledged to build a bridge to a village on the opposite side of the river.
Tong Thi Minh, 23, the teacher who shot the video, said students and teachers regularly use plastic bags to cross the stream, according to United Press International.
