School bans red ink
A school in the United Kingdom has banned teachers from using red pen while correcting students’ papers, the Daily Mail said on March 19.
The news said that teachers at Mounts Bay Academy were told to use green pens.
Meanwhile, the students were asked to leave comments or questions to the teachers in purple.
School authorities said that the encouragement is meant to help the kids to respond with their own comments instead of looking for teachers’ overall remarks.
A teacher from the school also told the newspaper that the red ink was a very negative color, and stops the pupils from taking time to think on their own.
