Widespread rioting in Britain, but why?
Days of rioting has left the citizens of Britain hurt and confused. Sparked by the death of 29-year old Mark Duggan, the rioting spun wildly out of control as thousands of youths took to the streets, stealing, attacking and vandalizing whatever they can get their hands on. 
Duggan was a suspected member of a local criminal gang who was shot by the police. When protesters gathered outside of the police station demanding more information regarding the circumstances of Duggan’s shooting, they were largely ignored.
 With a long history of tension between London residents and the Metropolitan Police, and the buildup of resentment amongst the underprivileged and undereducated, this explosion of anger may have been inevitable.
 The riots, which began in parts of London and have now spread to Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool, are causing major disturbances affecting the economic, social and safety of residents in the area. 
Unfortunately, the reason behind the widespread antisocial and criminal behavior of these mostly uneducated rioters is still a mystery. In fact, the New York Times reported on Aug. 10 that when a young man kicking a trash can into the street was asked why he was rioting, “he just shrugged.”
