WHO IS? Kim Jee-woon
Kim Jee-woon began his career as a theater director, but soon began to show-off his skills as a film director through increased levels of success in cinema. As an internationally acclaimed director, Kim has been nominated for a series of awards all over the world since he began making films. 
His directorial debut, The Quiet Family (1998), was nominated for Best Film at the Sitges-Catalonian International Film Festival the same year that it was released. His first win, however, came a year later in 1999 for the category of “Best Film – Live Action” at the Fantasporto, an annual international fantasy film festival held in Porto, Portugal.
 Kim’s most recent film, a thriller entitled I Saw the Devil (2010), has received four awards to date. At the 19th Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, it was awarded the prestigious top prize, the Golden Crow Award. The film also won several prizes at the 18th Fantastic Film Festival of Gerardmer in France.
