Seoul’s traditional music zone
At a time when K-pop is all the rage, the Seoul government has announced its plans to create a special zone dedicated to traditional Korean music.
To be set up just a stone’s throw away from another cultural landmark at the heart of the city, a 770-meter stretch of street between Changdeok Palace and Jongno 3-ga Station has been designated for the so-called “Korean Traditional Music Road Cultural District.” 
Once designated, the district will be reserved for shops and other such cultural complexes related to Korean traditional music. 
“In the current era of 10 million foreign tourists, there is a need to develop tradition-based cultural tourism products,” said Han Mun-cheol, a city official. “We will continue to make efforts to better preserve and further foster the Korean traditional music, the most representative of Korean culture, so as to make it a key axis of the Korean Wave (hallyu).”
The government hopes to complete this special zone by about 2016. Upon completion, the goal is for the district to be home to a diverse set of performances, exhibitions and attractions that can be enjoyed by both citizens and foreign tourists alike. 
In addition to the “Korean Traditional Music Road Cultural District,” the city plans to make a traditional music belt between the Namsan Gugakdang (Traditional Theater) and Bukchon Hanok Village.
