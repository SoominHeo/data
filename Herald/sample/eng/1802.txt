Kim Yu-na’s final ice shows 
Korean fans will have one last chance to see the country’s figure skating queen perform on ice after retiring from international competition at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
 This May, South Korea’s figure icon Kim Yu-na will skate for her final ice show in Korea and World Championship and Olympic medalists will join her.
 Kim’s agency, All That Sports, released a lineup of skaters who will perform at the Samsung Galaxy Smart Air Conditioner All That Skate 2014, which is scheduled to take place at Olympic Park in Seoul from May 4-6.
 The list includes Russian duo Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov, who won gold in figure skating pairs at 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and Denis Ten of Kazakhstan, the Olympic bronze medalist in the men‘s singles in Sochi. Ten paired up with Kim in the gala finale at the Sochi Games. His great-great-grandfather is reported to have been a Korean-born independence fighter, Gen. Min Keung-ho. Olympic bronze medalists Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy of Germany will also skate with Kim.
 Alexei Yagudin of Russia, who won gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics will also take part. Yagudin retired in 2002 after winning one Olympic gold medal, four world championships and three European titles.
 “Yu-na was a little girl when I first saw her in 2006, and now she is one of the world’s greatest figure skating legends,” said Yagudin. “It is my honor to perform with her in the same show.”
 The agency said Kim will unveil a new gala show to show her gratitude to her fans who have shown her constant support. Further details of the programs and ticket prices will be announced later.
