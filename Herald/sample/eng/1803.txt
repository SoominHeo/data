Jackie Chan debuts K-pop band
Popular Chinese action movie star Jackie Chan has launched a new K-Pop band.
 Known to be an avid K-pop fan, the famed actor debuted a new K-Pop group on March 20 on the country’s cable music show, Mnet Countdown, ahead of promotional activities in China.
 According to a report by Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chan took part in the entire process of the birth of the band JJCC-- from devising the concept of the band and recruiting the band members to training them and choosing a name for the group. He will take charge of the band’s management as well.
 “Jackie Chan has always been overflowing with good words about K-pop -- after he saw K-pop’s unlimited potential and possibility for development, he spent several years grooming JJCC,” said Xinhua news. “Their appearance is very handsome, and they’ve received individual training on their personality and stunts.” 
 JJCC’s name is a doubled acronym for “joining cultures,” referring to Chan’s efforts to “join cultures” in Asia. 
 “JJCC will amaze the world with their different music and a charm that has never existed before,” the group’s Korean agency, Jackie Chan Group South Korea, stated. 
 JJCC is comprised of four South Korean men including the team’s leader SimBa, E.co, Eddy, San-Cheong and one Australian-Chinese man named Prince Mak. They are all in their early 20s and can sing, dance, rap and act.
