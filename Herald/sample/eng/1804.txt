‘Anonymous’ threatens to hack Korean government websites
An international group of hackers known as “Anonymous” has announced that it will attack the South Korean government’s websites in April, according to officials on March 23.
 According to the Korean government, the group stated via its Twitter account and YouTube that it would conduct cyber attacks on the South Korean government on April 14, claiming that it has wasted taxpayers’ money, oppressed citizens and distorted the media.
 The specific targets of the attack were unknown, officials added.
 The officials said they would cooperate with the National Intelligence Service and the Ministry of Security and Public Administration to counteract the hackers’ attack.
 A number of North Korean websites and networks went offline in June last year, some days after Anonymous warned of cyberattacks on the communist regime.
 The hackers’ group is thought to be an international network that operates based on ideas rather than directives from a central leadership.
 The hackers have so far conducted many cyber offenses, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious and corporate websites for a variety of reasons.
 News reports say that the Anonymous members, who are called “Anons,” often use a mask that features a smiling Guy Fawkes as a symbol.
