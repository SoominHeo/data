Korea’s development in the tourism Industry
Our country has been developing since the year that the Korean War ended, something that has been called the “Miracle on the Han River.” As our country developed, more and more tourists have visited our country. In the year 2013, 10 million people visited Seoul, the capital. It is good news that more and more foreigners are visiting our country, but there are some rules our country has to follow in order to become a strong country in the tourism industry.
First of all, Koreans should not discriminate against foreigners. Many Koreans like white people more than black people. Koreans treat white people differently from black people. When white people try to talk to Koreans, Koreans try to respond as well as they can even if they don’t know a lot of English. However, when black people try to talk to them, a lot of people ignore them or try to get away from them. That is called discrimination. This serious problem has to be stopped in our country in order to attract foreigners of all colors. 
Also, we need to have more policies aimed at giving foreign tourists privileges, such as lower taxi fees. Many countries are trying to attract tourists, and without these policies, we will definitely lose to other countries like Australia or the United States. 
In conclusion, Korea has attracted a lot of tourists, but to keep up with this pace, we have to stop discriminating between black and white people, and give foreign tourists some privileges.
