Pixar, the best animation production company
Animated movies are very popular among children and adults. And one of the greatest animation companies is Pixar.
Pixar has made many famous movies like “Wall-E,” “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo,” “Ratatouille,” “Cars” and more, since it was founded in 1986. At first, Pixar was not an animation company. It was a hardware company that sold graphic design computers. However, as the Pixar computer began to lose popularity, John Lasseter made many short animations to advertise it. After they stopped selling computers, Pixar decided to work with animation company Walt Disney to make “Toy Story.” 
Pixar achieved great success with “Toy Story,” continuing to make more animations like “A Bug’s Life” and “Monsters, Inc.” The reason I think Pixar is the best animation company is because they were able to achieve great success with only one animation, and continue to make animations with amazing graphics every year. 
The most famous Pixar animated movie, “Toy Story,” was released in 1995. The movie’s graphics were amazing because it was impossible to show such realistic graphics at the time. Also, the movie’s scenario was really touching, sad and fun. Toy Story’s scenario made a lot of people laugh and cry. 
Pixar is the best animation production company. Most people think that, and I think so, too.
