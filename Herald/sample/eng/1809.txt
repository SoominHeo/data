President stresses reunification in Germany
Korean President Park Geun-hye made a speech at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany on March 29. Here are the key points she raised while talking about the two Korea's reunification through her speech. -- Ed.
 As president of a grateful nation, I thank Germany once again for placing its confidence and trust in the Republic of Korea, helping us pull through those difficult years.
I remember the bold courage of the German people as unification and integration unfolded.
A reunited Germany took its place at the heart of Europe.
Other parts of the former East Germany also made huge strides forward.
Just as the German people secured freedom, prosperity and peace by tearing down the Berlin Wall, we too, must tear down barriers in our march toward a new future on the Korean Peninsula.
Now more than ever, South and North Korea must broaden their exchange and cooperation.
It is about time South and North Korea allow family reunions to take place regularly.
I ask our friends here in Germany to join us on this journey to peaceful unification.
