Arnold Schwarzenegger back on the silver screen
After his eight-year long stint as governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is making a comeback on the silver screen with The Last Stand. 
According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), The Last Stand is a movie about a former Los Angeles police officer who has “resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in [the] sleepy border town [of] Sommerton Junction … following a bungled operation that left him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled.” 
Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens, the LA police officer-turned-sheriff of Sommerton Junction, who then finds himself standing between “the most notorious, wanted drug kingpin in the hemisphere” who has escaped from an FBI prisoner convoy and is heading for Mexico.
 The Last Stand will be the first time since 2004 that Schwarzenegger has played a credited role in a movie. According to AP, the movie is a “modern day Western about convicts making their way to the Mexico border through New Mexico after escaping from a Las Vegas prison.” 
On Oct. 17 Schwarzenegger tweeted, “Fantastic first day on the set of The Last Stand. Big thanks to the crew -- keep up the great work.”
 Directed by Kim Jee-woon (A Tale of Two Sisters, 2003, A Bittersweet Life, 2005, and The Good, The Bad, The Weird, 2008), shooting began on Oct. 17 in New Mexico and Nevada. 
The release date for The Last Stand is set for January 2013.
