Teen smartphone addiction
A recent survey found that more and more teens in Korea are suffering from smartphone addiction. Although the government has been trying to tackle the issue with preventive measures, it has been unsuccessful in curbing addiction rates among teens. 
In fact, while the recent survey showed that 11.8 percent of Koreans aged 10 to 54 are addicted based on the excessive use of smartphones, that number rose to 25.5 percent when the scope was narrowed to just teenagers. This means that 1 in 4 Korean teenagers is suffering from smartphone addiction, a 7.1 percent increase compared to the previous year. 
When the scope is narrowed further by school age, middle school students were found to be most at-risk for smartphone addiction at 29.3 percent. 
The survey also found that in general, mobile messaging (40.6 percent), news (17.6 percent) and online games (9.8 percent) were the primary reasons for smartphone use. On the other hand, “high-risk for addiction” users tend to also spend a lot of time on profile-based online services like Facebook and Kakaostory, in addition to reading the news or playing online games. 
The problem with smartphone addiction is that it could lead to economic problems. Not only does excessive smartphone use affect daily life, doing so long-term could lead to problems with the nation’s economic competitiveness. This is because while the average smartphone user spends approximately 4.1 hours on their mobile device, “high-risk of addiction” users spend a whopping 5.4 hours.
