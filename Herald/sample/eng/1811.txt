World powers kick Russia out of G8
U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders spoke with one voice on March 24 to expel Russia from the Group of Eight (G8), a group of leading industrialized countries.
 The decision came in The Hague, Netherlands, where Obama attended a nuclear security summit with other world leaders. The group summit, which was scheduled to take place in June this year in Sochi, Russia, the same venue as the 2014 Winter Olympics, is now also off. The series of moves are the latest responses from the international community to Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
 “International law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state’s territory through coercion or force,” the White House statement said. “We also strongly condemn Russia’s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations.”
 Despite the ongoing threat and possible sanctions in the future, Russia appears nonchalant; with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying it (being kicked out of G8) would be no big deal.
 The possibility of further advances into Ukraine by Russian troops is what concerns the international community the most. NATO has expressed concern that Russia might attempt to reclaim a region of Moldova, which is just west of Ukraine. The Obama administration also fears that Crimea could turn into Kosovo where a lot of blood was shed for its independence. “Our interest is not in seeing the situation escalate and devolve into hot conflict,” said U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice.
 According to CNN report, sanctions on Russia could include areas of energy, banking and defense -- all areas where Europe is deeply engaged economically with Russia.
 There are an estimated 20,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border.
