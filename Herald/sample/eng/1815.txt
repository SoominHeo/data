Cupcake vending machine
What a pleasant surprise! You may have heard of a vending machine that sells fresh salads. But you many not know one that gives you cupcakes.
It’s a new 24-hour vending machine that was recently installed in Manhattan.
The company that installed the machine, Sprinkles, has stocked the machine with various flavored cupcakes.
Buyers can choose from chocolate, coconut, red velvet and vanilla cupcakes.
Many night owls welcomed the new machine. 
“You can get money at any time. Now you can get cupcakes at any time,” Amy Benaderet, an office worker, told Reuters.
But not everybody loved the idea. Anthony Campagne, another New Yorker, said, “It just doesn’t make sense. People don’t need cupcakes at three in the morning.”
