Shocking ride with hammerhead shark
A 22-year-old university student enjoyed a rare adventure with a hammerhead shark.
Adam Fisk, a Florida Atlantic University student went out fishing with his friends in late March.
But the bait he used was chomped down on by a 3-meter-long shark, and Fisk was dragged around for two hours.
Fisk was able to record the shocking adventure to post it on YouTube.
The lucky fisher is a member of an extreme fishersâ€™ group, and the group estimated that Fisk was dragged about 20 kilometers during his adventure.
