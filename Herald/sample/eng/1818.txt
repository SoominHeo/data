Active mom makes active child 
The activity levels of mothers and children are directly linked, according to a U.K. study.
 To find out whether parents play a role in their children’s development of healthy exercise habits, researchers from Cambridge and Southampton universities studied 554 children aged four and their mothers from Southampton. For a week they wore heart-rate monitors and accelerometers to measure their activity levels -- they wore them non-stop, even while sleeping and bathing. 
 The study showed that there was a direct association between physical activity in children and their mothers, according to Kathryn Hesketh, who co-led the study. 
 The more active a mother was, the more physically active her child was. For every minute the mother was sedentary, children were 0.18 minutes more sedentary, so one hour of sedentary time in moms would correlate with 11 minutes more sedentary time for their children. On the contrary, for every minute of moderate-to-vigorous activity a mother engaged in, her child was more likely to engage in 10 percent more of the same level of activity. 
 “Although it is not possible to tell from this study whether active children were making their mothers run around after them, it is likely that activity in one of the pair influences activity in the other,” Hesketh said. Other factors that influenced a mother’s activity levels included were whether she worked or not and whether the child had siblings. 
 Still, the study discovered that once women enter motherhood, their activity levels fall and often fail to return to previous levels. This lack of activity could influence their young children. Thus, policies to improve children’s health should focus on their mothers, the study, published in Pediatrics, noted. 
 “Simply walking and moving more each day can be all it takes to create these benefits,” Hesketh added.
