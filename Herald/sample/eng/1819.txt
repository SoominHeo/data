Male stars and the military conundrum 
One of the biggest conundrums for any popular male star in Korea is the nationally mandated military service. Given how important it is to Koreans, avoiding military service is out of the question. This leaves every popular male star in his 20s facing one of the most difficult professional decisions of his life. 
As the saying goes, “out of sight, out of mind”: One of the biggest obstacles faced by male stars is that enlisting in the army could result in people forgetting about them. On the other hand, trying to delay the inevitable can also lead to problems. 
However, it turns out that this mandatory military service conundrum is a problem for more than just the actors themselves. This year, the entertainment industry finds itself in a bit of a pickle because some of today’s hottest actors are facing enlistment between now and next year. 
“As luck would have it, between this year and the next, the stars getting ready for enlistment all happen to be top casting picks for dramas,” said a senior official at the drama department of a major broadcasting company. 
Who are the stars preparing to enlist, and why is this a problem? Consider the fact that the stars set to enlist between now and next year includes such mega-stars as Yoo Ah-in, Kim Hyun-joong, Lee Min-ho, Jang Keun-suk, Kim Soo-hyun and Lee Seung-gi. 
However, fear not! Although these popular actors and singers may disappear from the public for the next two years, some old faces are about to return. Twenty-one-year-old Yoo Seung-ho will be discharged from the Army later in December, while actor Song Joong-ki will return in May 2015.
