Mao Asada regains title
Japanese figure skating icon Mao Asada won the crown in the world figure skating championships on March 30. It was her third world figure skating title.
Asada, who finished sixth at the Sochi Winter Olympics, got a total of 216.69 points this time.
Russia’s Julia Lipnitskaia and Italy’s Carolina Kostner followed Asada in second and third spot, respectively.
Asada performed her free skate to Sergei Rachmaninov’s “Piano Concerto No. 2.”
After the game, Asada told reporters: “I was much more nervous than I was for the short program but the cheering from the fans was with me and made me relax.”
 Asada’s long-time rival Kim Yu-na did not attend the championships as she had retired after the Sochi games.
Gold medalist of Russia at Sochi, Adelina Sotnikova did not attend the event this time, either.
There were other games that caught people’s attention.
Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu won the men’s event and became the champions of the Olympics and the world figure skating championships in the same year.
 German duo of Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy won the pairs event. It was their fifth title in the game.
