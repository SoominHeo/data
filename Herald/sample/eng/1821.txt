Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher expecting a baby
The former classmates of the popular U.S. comedy show, “That ’70s Show,” Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are expecting their first child.
 The 30-year-old Ukrainian beauty is reported to be pregnant with her first child with Kutcher just a month after announcing their engagement. It was the end of last month when Kunis was first spotted shopping with her mom at the Grove shopping center in L.A., wearing a diamond ring. She was also spotted attending a prenatal yoga class in Hollywood. Inside sources confirmed that Kutcher finally popped the question and that the Hollywood couple were planning their wedding.
 “This is something they both wanted,” a source close to the couple told Us Weekly. “They are both so happy. Ashton and Mila feel like they won the baby lottery.”
 “We have a thing called white T-shirt night and it’s when you wear jeans and a white T-shirt and you go on a date,” Kunis told a local entertainment news channel about her easy-going relationship with Kutcher. “Nothing fancy, it’s just something that you love to do. And whether that’s bowling or dinner or going to a cheese shop and have some wine or walking around. I think that’s just the best thing to do.”
 The 36-year-old “Two and a Half Men” star has been dating Kunis for about two years. Before dating her, Kutcher was married to his first wife Demi Moore for over seven years and their divorce was finalized last November. Kutcher recently appeared in high-profile biography film “Jobs,” depicting deceased Apple creator Steve Jobs.
