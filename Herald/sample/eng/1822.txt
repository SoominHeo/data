Lee Michelle releases debut single 
Lee Michelle, a 2011 K-pop Star contender, officially released a single at the end of March.
Lee said, with her single “Without You,” she wanted to tell people about her own story.
In the single’s seven-minute music video, Lee shows her social struggles while growing up, and explains how she has overcome many obstacles so far.
The video features a young half Korean, half black girl who was intended to represent anyone who has been in a similar situation.
“When I saw and heard my music for the first time after it was posted in Melon, I just started crying,” Lee said in an interview with The Korea Herald.
Born to a Korean mother and African-American father in Paju, Lee grew up in Korea with her mother and older sister.
Lee has never met her father after their parents got divorced.
When she first auditioned for K-pop Star, Lee surprised the judges when she spoke in Korean, even though it was her mother tongue.
Lee had hard time growing up in a homogenous society as a school kid, she admitted.
However, she tried to inspire people with her voice and music despite all the hardships.
“I looked at K-pop Star as my only chance,” Lee said to The Korea Herald.
She further said that she was just going to get a normal job to support her family if she hadn‘t done well on the show.
Lee’s personal story and talent touched the lives of many in 2011.
Now three years after the show, Lee has come back to people and says: “The message I wanted to emphasize is breaking down barriers and overcoming my pain.”
“For those people listening to the song and feeling as though my story is similar to their struggles, then what I want to tell them is to embrace your inner strength,” she added.
