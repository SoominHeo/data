Everland’s Tulip Festival
Spring is officially here. For those who are in danger of going stir-crazy, the warmer temperatures and blooming flowers have once again made spending time outdoors enjoyable. What better way is there to celebrate the season of life than to spend the day at one of Korea’s most popular theme parks for the “2014 Everland Tulip Festival”? 
No one can deny that spending a warm, spring day at a theme park is one of the best ways to celebrate the end of winter. Add a garden full of bright, beautiful and fragrant tulips and you can say goodbye to those winter blues. 
This year, more than 120 different breeds of tulips are being showcased at the Four Seasons Garden in Samsung’s Everland Resort. 
Visitors can walk through the garden, taking pictures with the beautiful flowers as they bask in the warmth of the sun. New to this year’s Tulip Festival is the Nest (Dungji) Garden. Families can gather at this newly created sculpture of a bird’s nest as they welcome the new season.
