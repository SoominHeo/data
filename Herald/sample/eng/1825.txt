My favorite springtime activity
What is your favorite season? My favorite season is spring, because of one of the activities I can do in the spring. Can you guess what it is? It’s going to cherry blossom festivals. 
 There is a street near by my school that has so many cherry blossom trees and flowers, so every spring we have a cherry blossom festival. The flowers are very beautiful. In the night the colorful light makes the flowers more beautiful and colorful. And we can see performances and various kinds of food vendors, too. So, I always go there and have fun with my friends after school. We buy some food and walk around the street and talk. It is really fun. 
 And there is another perfect street for cherry blossom festival. There is a cherry blossom marathon. I participated in the marathon last year with my friend. It was very good. Running alongside the flowers was fantastic. But it was a little bit hard to finish the course. There is a bike path along the route, too. I think it is the perfect place for a date. I didn’t ride a bike last year, so this year I want to do that.
 Everyone will be very busy because a new semester has started, but I hope you take the time to enjoy spring to the fullest.
