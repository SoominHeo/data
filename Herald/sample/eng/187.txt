Mother Nature’s latest victim: Turkey
Citizens of Turkey are still reeling and in need of assistance after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, the strongest in a decade, rocked the nation on Oct. 23. 
According to Reuters, as of Oct. 27 the earthquake has demolished about 3,000 buildings, killed nearly 500 people and left thousands homeless as rescue workers began “taking painful decisions to call off searches for those buried alive.” 
On a higher note, a premature baby girl named Azra was found alive under a collapsed building on Oct. 25, which helped lift the spirits of rescue workers. 
“We have hope. There are always miracles. Normally, we do not expect anyone to survive after 72 hours but people have survived longer than that before,” an unnamed rescue official told Reuters as he stood by the collapsed building where Azra was found.
