Educational freedom for a newly free nation
The newly independent nation of South Sudan passed a bill late Oct. 25 that will change the language of education from Arabic to English. 
The government announced on Oct. 26 that the Higher and General Education Bill was passed by the new nation’s parliament, changing the language used in primary level schools to English. This effectively allows South Sudan to shrug off decades of Arabic imposed by the north.
 Information Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin told reporters, “This new year, we are teaching our national languages at preschool, and the rest of the instructions, mathematics or science, all in English, there’s no Arabic.” Arabic will, however, be offered as an optional language choice.
