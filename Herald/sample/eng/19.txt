Korea and Japan, at war again
On Aug. 8 the U.S. maritime-boundary agency confirmed its decision to support the use of “Sea of Japan” to name the body of water between Korea and Japan, inciting anger amongst Korean citizens and officials alike. 
Japan and Korea have spent decades fighting over the name of the sea, with South Korea insisting it should be named the “East Sea” while Japan claims it should be called the “Sea of Japan.” 
While this controversy has taken a back seat to the territorial dispute over the Dokdo islets, the recent decision by the U.S. government-funded agency to support the name “Sea of Japan” has brought the issue to light once again. 
According to Yonhap News, South Korea has been lobbying the international community to use both “East Sea” and “Sea of Japan” simultaneously since 1992, during the 6th United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. Unfortunately, this new development will cause a setback in South Korea’s push for the simultaneous use of “East Sea” and “Sea of Japan” in the next International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) publication.
