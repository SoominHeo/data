Climber Park missing in Annapurna
The Korean Alpine Federation (KAF) said on Oct. 25 that it had failed to find three mountain climbers missing for a week in north-central Nepal’s Annapurna.
 South Korean mountaineer Park Young-seok, 47, and two fellow climbers, Kang Ki-seok and Shin Dong-min, went missing on Oct. 18 during scaling Nepal’s Annapurna Mountain. The KAF sent a rescue team and Sherpas to search for the missing crews. 
 “We won’t give up if there is a 1 percent chance of survival,” a rescuer said. “We will bring Park home to his family.” 
 The team used metal detectors to look under the snow, in case they were buried in it. A Sherpa who participated in the search said that as the area looks very clean, “It looks like snow and rocks came down from the 8,901-meter peak, creating a new slope.”
 According to Yonhap News, Park became the first person in the world to earn the Adventurers’ Grand Slam, which includes reaching the North and South Poles and climbing the world’s 14 highest peaks.
