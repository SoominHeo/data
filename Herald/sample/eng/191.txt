China’s vice premier visits S. Korea
Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang arrived in South Korea Oct. 26 for a two-day visit in an effort to revive the stalled six-nation talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs and expand South Korea and China’s bilateral currency swap deal, Foreign Ministry officials said.
 Li, who is widely regarded as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao’s successor at next year’s election is the seventh-ranked member of the Communist Party of China. He emphasized that when he met North Korean leader Kim during his three day visit in Pyongyang, Kim was eager to return to the six-party talks without preconditions. The North left the six-party talks in 2009 and then conducted its second nuclear test the following month. 
 With his visit, an official at Seoul’s Finance Ministry noted that South Korea and China also planned to expand S. Korea-China won-yuan currency swap agreements from the current $26 billion to $50 billion or $60 billion.
