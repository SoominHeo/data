Lee’s river projects make waves
South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak’s $19 billion project to revitalize the country’s four major rivers has stoked fears among the Korean people as it seemed too ambitious and “not-so-green.”
 Lee’s “Green New Deal” includes work on the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan rivers and the ministry claims it will save 1.3 billion tons of water a year for drinking and farming, and also reduce floods. 
 AP pointed out that floods and droughts cost S. Korea $3.65 billion annually. 
“This is a very essential project as flash floods will be reduced significantly in rainy seasons and a shortage of water will be resolved in dry seasons,” Jung Kwan-Sue, a water resources specialist and a Chungnam University professor said. He says it was a timely, green growth centered project.
 Supporters predict that over four-year period, 340,000 new jobs will be created with economic output boosted by 40 trillion won. However, Yun Sun-Jin of Seoul National University and Cho Myungrae of Dankook University say the four rivers project will only create short-term jobs that will not be much help in combating Korea’s worsening employment problem among highly-educated younger generation.
 Civic groups also scolded the government saying the scheme is damaging the existing environment. “Water quality has already deteriorated because of new dams and excessive dredging, which endangers the survival of fish,” an environmental activist told AFP.
 While President Lee is confident the plan promises dual effects of environmental and economic gains for Korea, some pundits are worried that its potential economic gain would be tiny.
 The plan, which began in 2009, is now 80 percent complete, according to the report. Rivers have been dredged, roads, sewage plants and cultural, sightseeing infrastructures have been constructed and bicycle lanes, 16 weirs, dams and natural passageways for fish have been built.
