The Earth’s building blocks
You might think that rocks are pretty dull. But rocks tell the history of the Earth, including stories of giant explosions, mountains rising from the sea, and buried forests turning to stone. 
 Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. Most minerals are inorganic, which means that they are not made from living things. They are substances that occur naturally in the earth. Some minerals are metals, such as iron and gold. Others are nonmetallic, like quartz and calcite. 
 Some minerals contain the hardened remains of animals and plants. Limestone rock, for example, is made up largely of bits and pieces of shells and skeletons of sea creatures. All rocks fall into one of three groups, depending on how they are formed.
 Igneous rocks are formed from cooling magma, which is the lava released in a volcanic eruption. The earliest rocks on Earth were igneous. Rocks don’t stay the same forever.
 They break down into small pieces because of the effects of wind, water, and ice. When small pieces of rock settle together, they’re known as “sediment.” As layers settle on other layers over many years, their weight squeezes the pieces together into solid sedimentary rock. Both photos show the very common sedimentary rock called “sandstone,” which is cemented sand.
 The third group of rocks gets its name from the word “metamorphosis,” which means “change.” Metamorphic rocks are created when extreme temperatures or pressures cause changes in igneous or sedimentary rocks.
 Marble is a metamorphic rock formed from intensely squeezed and heated limestone. And limestone, you’ll remember, began as seashells and skeletons. This is another amazing Earth story told by a rock!
