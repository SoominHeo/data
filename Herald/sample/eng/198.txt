Yoo Seung-ho and IU put off college
Popular teen actor Yoo Seung-ho turned down special admission offers from nation’s prominent universities, his agency said.
 The 18-year-old actor received special offers from several schools in Seoul, but he allegedly postponed his higher education in order to devote his time to acting.
 Yoo’s agency released a statement that “Yoo decided not to attend university at this time and concentrate solely on acting.” He was known to have a difficult time balancing school work and acting during middle and high school, so he didn’t want to go through that trouble again, at least not yet, the Agency added. 
 It also said that Yoo didn’t want to take away other students’ chances to study, considering that he would not be able to concentrate on his studies.
 With his remark, controversy regarding the special admission offers granted to celebrities and public figures by universities flared up. 
 Yoo is a senior at Baekshin High School in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. He made his film debut in “The Way Home” and since then, has appeared in many popular TV dramas and films. 
 Along with Yoo, singer IU made headlines by declining special admission offers, too. A report suggested that IU turn down a few high-ranking universities’ offers because she wanted to major in studies that are closely linked to her true passion and talents. IU clearly wrote at her fan cafe that she “will apply to universities when the time is right” and that it is not the right time for her.
 IU debuted in September, 2008 and won her first award on SBS Inkigayo for her popular song, “Nagging” in June, 2010. IU has a number of award-winning songs, including “Good Day.”
 Previously, IU and Yoo Seung-ho collaborated for a duet with the song, “Believe in Love.”
