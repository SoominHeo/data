Fear grips Virginia Tech once again
Virginia Tech was put on lockdown and searched extensively on Aug. 4 after a possible gunman was reported to be on campus. After 5 hours of searching, the man in question was not found and the school finally gave the all-clear just before 3 p.m. 
The massacre at Virginia Tech by Cho Seung-hui in 2007 left the school and its students devastated, leading the school to revamp its emergency procedures. 
Sirens and alerts by text message, email and twitter went out at around 10 a.m. when three teenagers attending a summer program told police they saw a man walking quickly across the campus, with what they thought might be a handgun covered by a piece of cloth, AP reported. 
Police searched the entire campus, but found no sign of the alleged gunman. 
“Virginia Tech – ever since 4/16 – we’ve been so paranoid. We hear about everything that goes on on campus, which is good, but sometimes people freak out when it’s a false alarm,” Rachel Larson, a 22-year old student at Virginia Tech tells AP. 
After the lockdown was lifted, police continued to patrol the grounds as a precaution.
