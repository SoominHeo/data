Attempted murderer caught running hagwon
A 33-year-old Korean-American man accused of attempted murder in the United States in 1997 was arrested by Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Yonhap News said on Aug. 9.
 He was found to be running an SAT hagwon in Gangnam even though he only has a high school degree, but he used a forged degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, or UCLA, to advertise to students and parents, police stated. 
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said on Aug. 8 that the fugitive, surnamed Kim has been on the Los Angeles police’s wanted list since he was 17 and fled to Korea.
 In Korea, with his relatives’ help, he acquired the ID of a man who had emigrated to the U.S. and fabricated a driver’s license and passport.
 In December 2008, Kim opened a SAT preparation institute in Seoul’s glamorous Apgujeong area. Police said that Kim may be extradited to the United States.
