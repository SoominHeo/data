White Halloween for northeastern U.S.
As if the damage from Hurricane Irene weren’t enough, the northeastern part of the U.S. was hit hard by a rare snow storm on the weekend of Oct. 29-30. 
The unseasonal blizzard left millions without power for days after it had passed. Schools had to be canceled due to the lack of power, while treacherous road conditions have made it difficult for commuters to get to work on time. 
The weather has also been blamed for at least 15 deaths as of Nov. 2, not only because of slippery roads but also from “unvented toxic fumes in homes where people were running alternative power sources, such as gas generators and propane stoves,” according to Reuters.
