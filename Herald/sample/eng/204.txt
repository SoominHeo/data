World population: 7 billion
Countries all over the world celebrated the milestone of the world’s population reaching 7 billion on Oct. 31. 
According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) the world population was estimated to reach 7 billion on Oct. 31. The United States Census Bureau on the other hand, projected that the world population would not hit 7 billion until February. 
The New York Times quoted Gerhard Heilig, the chief of population estimates and projections section of the U.N. Population Division, as acknowledging that “No one can know the exact number of people on the globe.” 
In celebration of this milestone, the births of babies all over the world on Oct. 31 were celebrated as the symbolic “7 billionth baby.”
