S. Korea sets 55 trillion won unification fund
The Korean government is planning to raise 55 trillion won to prepare for Korea’s reunification, Yu Woo-ik, the Unification Minister said.
 “Government agencies will soon make a unification account and lawmakers will pass a related law within this year,” Yu said in an interview with Bloomberg News, published on Nov. 1. 
“This will unite people in the South and foster their desire for unification.”
 Since his inauguration on September, Yu has maintained a “flexible” approach toward the communist regime. 
“The fund would be raised through government budgets and private donations,” he said. According to a ministry-affiliated research institute, the cost of reunification could be as high as 249 trillion won.
