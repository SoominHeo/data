East Asian universities’ joint degree program
Leading universities in Korea, China and Japan are expected to launch a joint degree program next year in an effort to boost the three nations’ academic exchanges, South Korean educational authorities said.
 The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Korea Council for University Education announced on Oct. 30 that 10 South Korean colleges and universities would take part in the “Campus Asia” program. Among them are Seoul National University, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University, POSTECH, Dongseo University and Busan National University.
 The three neighboring East Asian nations reached an agreement on increasing their university exchange activities at a summit in May last year. It is the East Asian version of the Erasmus Project, a European Union student exchange program, explained Yonhap News.
 According to the report, the program is a win-win offer for both universities and studets. Universities in Korea, Japan and China could form an education consortium with universities in other countries under the Campus Asia project. In addition, students who are participating in the program could earn dual degrees from both universities that they have attended and completed their studies after they fulfill the academic requirements stipulated in the program. Students can also make use of an internship program offered from three months to one academic year in one of these three countries.
 The report added that seven Chinese universities and ten Japanese institutions that are part of the program included Peking University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Jilin University and Renmin University from China and the University of Tokyo, Ritsumeikan University, Kyushu University, Tohoku University and Nagoya University from Japan.
