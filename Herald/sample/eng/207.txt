N. Korea’s pro-regime propaganda strengthens
North Korea is leveling up the regime’s propaganda efforts toward its people as it strives to avert a similar uprising to the one that happened in Libya and caused the downfall of its long-time dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.
 In the North, the news of Gadhafi being killed by his own citizens in the hometown of Sirte has been kept under wraps as authorities are fretting over the prospect of a similar revolt in the North.
 Kim’s regime went even further by releasing a statement on Rodong Sinmun saying that it would reinforce the “superior” way of life, which includes imperialistic ideas and lifestyles. Pyongyang has also ordered its citizens working in African and Middle Eastern nations not to return home, Yonhap News reported.
