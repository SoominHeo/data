India set to become world‘s third largest economy
India has lately been recorded the world’s third largest economy in 2011, outpacing Japan, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) measured by purchasing power. 
Japan’s Nihon Keizai Shimbun in October quoted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as saying that India’s GDP in 2011 measured according to the purchasing power parity (PPP) was $4.47 trillion while that of Japan stood at $4.40 trillion.
 Meanwhile, in terms of nominal GDP, a more widely recognized economic indicator, India was expected this year to stand 10th, far below Japan.
 Unlike per capita nominal GDP, GDP in purchasing power parity explains the real standard of people’s lives, since it measures the ability to buy products on the condition that world prices and foreign exchange rates stay the same. 
Experts say that India will overtake Japan even in terms of nominal GDP, based upon the country’s continued economic growth.
 They also say that Japan’s economy is widely expected to contract this year, affected by the devastating tsunami and earthquakes in March.
 The IMF said that India was following the footsteps of China in terms of economic growth. China overtook Japan in purchasing power-based GDP in 2001, and in 2010 the country beat out Japan again in nominal GDP as well.
 John Hawksworth, an economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the world’s largest accountancy firms, said that India had a higher economic growth rate and larger population than other advanced countries and that it is only a matter of time until India becomes the most significant economy in the world.
 The IMF predicted that Korea’s GDP in purchasing power parity would be the world’s 12th. 
Meanwhile, Korea’s per capital gross national income (GNI) will top $20,000 for a second straight year this year and be around $23,500 and $24,000, according to Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance on Nov. 6.
