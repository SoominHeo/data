What went wrong with Chile?
The problems currently facing Chile are not confined to public education but extend the way the country is run in general.
 Students‘ discontent with education comes from a perception that the education system gives rich students access to the best schooling, while squeezing poor ones into under-funded state schools, BBC explains.
 Even though Chileans statistically enjoy the best education in Latin America, there are many variables that make accurate estimate of the true picture hard to get at, according to local education experts.
 Chilean students argue that over half the schools in the country are privately run and that those private schools should stop making profits from education and invest the extra income in improving the quality of education.
 However, Chilean Education Ministry flatly rejects the students’ demands, saying that “school education should not be a state monopoly.” The ministry goes on to say that the private sector has to play a role in overall education.
 Although education is at the core of Chile‘s agony, there are still more problems, according to the BBC.
 Environmentalists in the country have marched against a plan to build a hydro-electric plant and copper miners have staged strikes. Gay rights campaigners have asked for gender equality, and transport workers have protested about job security.
 What is interesting is these social problems do not match well the country’s economic standing among other Latin American nations.
 Chile has been considered one of South America’s most stable and prosperous nations, as evidenced by its fastest economic growth rate in the 1990s and successful handling of the recent regional economic instability. However, it has long suffered from high economic inequality.
