Lower sales commissions for small vendors
According to Yonhap News, Korea’s major department stores have agreed to lower sales commissions for small and mid-sized suppliers to help ease their financial burden.
 The top three department stores -- Lotte, Shinsegae and Hyundai -- have decided to lower sales commission rates for 1,054 vendors from around 32 percent to 25-29 percent.
 The new rates will be applied from October 2011, said the Fair Trade Commission (FTC).
 Vendors pay commissions in return for the space and promotional activities by the department stores but these commissions took a heavy toll on small companies while global luxury brands were charged less.
 The high commission rates increased prices and aggravated the government’s inflation management efforts, a report pointed out.
 Amidst a nation-wide pursuit of “shared growth” between small and large businesses, the FTC Chairman Kim Dong-soo said that the agency would keep tabs on whether the rate reduction was actually being enforced.
 The watchdog also demanded TV home shopping operators to lower commissions for small vendors.
