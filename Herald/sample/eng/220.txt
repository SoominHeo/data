Cheonggyecheon, a home to bacteria
A popular stream running through downtown Seoul, Cheonggyecheon, has been polluted by bacteria, the city government said on Nov. 8.
 According to KBS news, Cheonggyecheon contains as much as 53 times the legal limit of colon bacillus. 
 The most contaminated area of the stream was downstream.
 A Seoul official hinted the stream may have been contaminated during the rainy season. He said that pollutants might possibly have entered through rainwater pipes. 
 However, pundits demand an all-out investigation into the water quality management of the frequently visited stream.
 Seoul says Cheonggyecheon is visited by around 17 million people annually.
