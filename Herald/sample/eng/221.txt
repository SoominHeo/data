Face of hope from Somalia famine
Minhaj Gedi Farah has now become the face of hope from the famine that has gripped Somalia since July. 
In an annual New York fundraising event held by the nongovernmental international relief group International Rescue Committee (IRC), Farahâ€™s story was highlighted to show what making a difference looked like. 
The IRC is responsible for helping nurse Farah back to health when he showed up at the IRC Hospital in Kenya weighing only 3.1 kg at 7 months old. 
Three months of intense feeding of a peanut-based nutrition paste later, Farah now weighs 8 kg. 
With his chubby cheeks and bright smile, Farah has become a symbol of hope and survival in a land where hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of starvation.
