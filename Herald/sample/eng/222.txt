Pulling out of Iraq
A U.S. military spokesman announced on Nov. 9 that U.S. forces have handed Joint Base Balad over to Iraqi control. As the second largest base for U.S. forces in Iraq, this move has sparked fears of al-Qaida’s possible return.
 As the last members of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing headed home on Nov. 8, the 25 square kilometer base with a 20 kilometer security perimeter was officially left under the control of Iraqi forces. 
The spokesman explained that with an average of 27,500 landings and take-offs a month in 2006, JBB is considered to be one of the world’s busiest airports. In terms of personnel, JBB came in second after the Victory Base Complex. At its peak, JBB housed 28,000 uniformed personnel and 8,000 civilian contractors. There are still eleven bases left to hand over, including the Victory Base Complex.
 All U.S. military personnel are scheduled to pull out of Iraq by the end of the year after negotiations broke down between Baghdad and Washington on a post-2011 U.S. military training mission.
