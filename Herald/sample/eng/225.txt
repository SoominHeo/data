Penguins enjoying “stinky spa”
King penguin chicks bathing in a “mud spa” in the mild summer sunshine were captured by BBC’s documentary film, the Frozen Planet. 
“The birds paddled in the mud to cool off their giant, fluffy bodies from overheated summer weather, “the producer of the film, Miles Barton explained.
 King penguins reportedly carry out the bathing ritual to survive through the winter and the summer. “The streams run off the glacier, so the water’s nice and chilly for them,” he said.
 Penguins’thick feathers protect them from cold winter, where temperatures fall near -10 Celsius. However, they turn into a nuisance in summer time when temperatures reach around 17 Celsius.
 After a week of following the penguin colony, BBC Nature said they could obtain the “unexpected footage of mud-bathing” in St Andrews Bay, South Georgia, in the South Atlantic Ocean.
 Barton disclosed a behind-the-scenes story that the pool is not really a mud pond but was actually made up of dead birds’ waste and remains. 
He recalled that St Andrews Bay possessed a striking contrast between the beautiful scenery and an overwhelmingly stinky smell. “That pool was the rotted remains of dead penguins and tons of penguin poo.” “when the chicks got wet, they looked like drowned rats,” he said.
