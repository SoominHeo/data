When water Is stronger than stone
Caves are natural openings in the ground large enough for a person to get in. Most have been made when rainwater or streams have worn away rock -- usually a softer rock such as limestone. The wearing-away process is called “erosion.” Slowly, over millions of years, the water works away at the soft rock, making a small tunnel-like opening. As more and more rock wears away, the opening grows wider and deeper. Soon even more water can flow in. In time, many of these openings become huge caves, or caverns.
 Mammoth Cave-Flint Ridge in Kentucky is a linked system of caverns. It is more than 500 kilometers long, and one of the longest in the world. In France the Jean Bernard, though much shorter (17 kilometers long), is one of the world’s deepest caves, reaching down more than 5,000 feet.
 Some caves have beautiful craggy formations called “stalactites,” like those pictured here, that hang from the cave’s roof. These are made by water seeping into the cave. Each drop leaves a very tiny bit of dissolved rock on the ceiling of the cave. After thousands and thousands of years, an icicle-shaped stalactite forms.
 When water drips to the cave’s floor, it deposits small particles of solids. These slowly build up into a stalagmite, which looks like an upside-down icicle. There are other kinds of caves that are made in different ways. When lava flows out of a volcano, it sometimes leaves gaps, making volcanic caves. When ice melts inside a glacier, glacier caves result. And ocean waves pounding on the shore year after year can wear away a cave in the face of a cliff.
