Homeward bound
Two of the most prominent Korean baseball players are coming home and looking to continue their careers in Korea Professional Baseball. Lee Seung-yeop, the 35-year-old slugging first baseman, decided to opt out of his contract with the Osaka-based Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He expressed a desire to return to the Samsung Lions -- his former team where he established himself as franchise player. Park Chan-ho, the 38-year old pitcher, also of the Orix Buffaloes, was released by the team after an injury-plagued and disappointing season. He indicated that he would like a chance to play for a local team upon his return to Korea.　
 Lee Seung-yeop is widely considered one of the best hitters in the history of professional baseball in Korea. He joined Samsung Lions in 1995 and enjoyed a stellar nine-year career with the team. Nicknamed “the Lion King”, he was known for his smooth fielding, fluid swing and mammoth homeruns. He won the coveted Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times, the Golden Glove Award twice, and the Korean Series championship twice. His greatest season was 2003 in which he hit a KBO record 56 homeruns and drove in 144 runs. He was a regular fixture on the Korean national team and was instrumental in helping Korea win the baseball gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.　
 In 2004, Lee Seung-yeop signed with the Chiba Lotte Marines of Japan’s Pacific League. He achieved moderate success after a slow start but played a crucial role in helping the team win the Japan Series in 2005 by hitting three homeruns. In 2006, Lee Seung-yeop joined the most successful team in NPB -- the Yomiuri Giants. He had an excellent year - batting .323, with 41 homeruns and 108 runs-batted-in (RBI). He was rewarded with a lucrative four-year, 44.3 billion contract. However, his performance suffered greatly as a result of nagging injuries, causing him to miss numerous games and spending extended periods of time in the minor leagues. After a miserable 2010 season, in which he batted .163 with 5 homeruns and 11 RBI’s in 56 games, Lee Seung-yeop signed with Orix, but his struggles continued.
 Park Chan-ho joined the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1994.  After spending the first two years in the Dodgers’ minor league system, he became a full-time starting pitcher in 1997.  He compiled a record of 124 wins and 98 losses, 1,715 strikeouts and 4.36 ERA in his 17-year career in the MLB.  His best performance was the 2000 season in which he finished with a win-loss record of 18-10, 217 strikeouts, and a respectable 3.27 ERA. In 2001, he was selected to the National League All-Star Team. 
Park Chan-ho became a free agent in 2002, and signed a five-year, $65 million contract with the Texas Rangers. It was one of the largest contracts for a pitcher at that time, and unfortunately, also one of the worst free agent signings of the decade. Pitching in a hitter-friendly ball park and battling several injuries, his performance declined drastically. In four years with Texas, his win/loss record was a dismal 22-23, with an ERA over 5.50. He was traded to the San Diego Padres in 2005, and bounced around six different MLB teams in the subsequent years, mainly as a relief pitcher.
