Higher premiums for the rich
The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced on Nov. 14 that high-income earners will pay higher health insurance premiums while lower-income earners will see their payments alleviated. It is part of a government’s move to achieve “balanced” health insurance system, said Yonhap News.
 Starting September 2012, people with employer-based national health insurance policies who earn more than 70 million won will see their premiums jump to 582,000 won on average.
 The National Health Insurance program has been criticized for the way it charges people on different incomes; those on higher-incomes have paid a similar amount to lower earners for their health insurance.
 There are currently 1.53 million people with more than one source of income, which allows them to pay less by making insurance payments on only one of their sources of income. Of them 33,000 making more than 88 million won. The ministry found 1,103 high-income earners who abused the system in 2010.
 Choi Hee-joo, an official from the ministry’s health insurance policy department noted, “If the bill is passed in the next regular session of the National Assembly, the new system will take effect starting next September.”
