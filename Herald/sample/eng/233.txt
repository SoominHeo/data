Ex-President banned from leaving country
The former President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was blocked from leaving the country by airport officials on Nov. 15, in connection with an investigation into corruption allegations, despite a Supreme Court order allowing her to travel abroad for medical treatment. 
Arroyo was subsequently arrested on Nov. 19 for allegations of rigging the senatorial elections in 2007.
 The current Philippine government, under President Benigno Aquino III, claims that if she were allowed to travel, she may never return because of the investigation. The government cited that the countries she wanted to visit currently have no extradition treaty with the Philippines.
