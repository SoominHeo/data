OWS movement takes a hit
The Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement and its smaller satellite protests have taken a few hits lately, most notably with the arrest and eviction of protestors from Zuccotti Park by the New York Police Department (NYPD) on the early morning of Nov. 15. 
With the government’s recent crackdown on the movement -- shutting down camps and protest sites, especially Zuccotti Park, the main hub and birthplace of the OWS movement -- many are angry with the perceived breach of protestors’ First and Fourth Amendment rights. 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City defended the controversial decision not to allow the media to report on the Nov. 15 raid of Zuccotti Park by the NYPD, which led to over 200 arrests, including those of journalists from AP, the Wall Street Journal and more.
