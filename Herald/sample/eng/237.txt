Humidifier sterilizers banned for causing lethal lung disease
The government on Nov. 11 banned the sale of six types of sterilizers used in household humidifiers because they were suspected of causing deadly and unknown hardening of lung tissue. They took the lives of nine people this year alone.
 The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said research on animals and people both revealed a strong connection between the sterilizer and the lung disorders.
 Although the findings are not yet conclusive, the government agency ordered immediate and comprehensive recalls of all products from market.
 The KCDC said that it plans to designate all types of humidifier-sterilizers as medical products in the coming days to make sure they are subject to more detailed safety tests.
