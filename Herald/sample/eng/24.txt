The biggest ice cubes
Icebergs are simply broken-off pieces of glaciers or polar ice sheets that float out into the ocean. Very big pieces. Even little icebergs called “growlers” are as big as a bus. Big ones are longer than a freight train and as high as a skyscraper. 
One especially surprising thing about an iceberg is that the part you see above the water is only a small bit of the whole iceberg. Most of the iceberg is underwater. You can see the way an iceberg floats by doing an easy experiment at home.
 Fill a clear glass half full of very cold water. Drop an ice cube into the glass. Notice how most of the ice cube stays below the water. The ice cube floats just the way an iceberg floats. And as the cube melts, it turns over, just as an iceberg does. Icebergs melt when they float away from freezing waters into warmer waters. Icebergs always start in the part of the world where it stays cold all the time, near the North or the South Pole.
 Icebergs can be very dangerous when they float, big and silent, into the path of a ship. In the past many ships were wrecked because they hit an iceberg. 
Fortunately, this hardly ever happens anymore. This is because most modern ships have radar that finds the icebergs before they become a problem.
 In addition, special airplanes from the International Ice Patrol watch for icebergs in likely areas, and satellites scan the oceans every day. Maps and warnings are regularly sent by radio to all the ships in nearby waters.
