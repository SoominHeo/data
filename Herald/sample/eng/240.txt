Brains of computer gamers different
The brains of regular computer gamers are different from those of infrequent players, BBC News suggested.
 According to the report, teenagers who play computer games on a regular basis proved to have a larger “reward hub,” called a ventral striatum, in their brains compared to non-regular players. Ventral striatum is known to have a link to the brain’s reward system. 
 On the discovery, regular gamers’ brain scans showed an enlarged ventral striatum.
 Dr. Simone Kuhn, one of the researchers from Ghent University in Belgium, said the region is ”usually activated when people anticipate positive environmental effects or experience pleasure,” such as winning the lottery, eating good food, and having feelings of love. The region has also been implicated in drug addiction, Dr. Kuhn claimed.
 Researchers classified 154 14-year-olds by the number of hours they play computer games in a week. The average playing time was found to be nine hours. Those who played more than nine hours were taken as frequent players. 
 The study concluded that playing video games for 12 hours a week may actually cause a structural change to brains of teenagers. Dr. Luke Clark from the department of experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge said that it was not yet conclusive if games changed the brain of the players or if differences in brains coaxed people into a more avid playing habit.
 Playing computer games has been linked to and blamed for a range of adverse effects in children’s brain development, including addiction. 
 According to Wikipedia, computer game addiction, or computer game overuse, is excessive or compulsive use of computer games that can easily interrupt daily life. People who are addicted tend to play compulsively, separating themselves from family or friends and mainly focus on the in-game situations.
