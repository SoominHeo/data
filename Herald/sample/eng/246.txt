Pyongyang's troubled construction drive
Hundreds of North Korean college students have reportedly died in a series of accidents at construction sites in Pyongyang as the communist country prepares for a landmark political event next year, a source familiar with the issue said. 
An estimated 200 college students were rumored to have been killed in accidents at several construction sites in North Korea’s capital city, Pyongyang. 
The North is struggling to achieve its grand, state-level mission of building “a prosperous nation” by 2012. 2012 is the centennial year of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the late founder of the nation and the father of current leader Kim Jong-il. The year, therefore, bears a huge significance to the regime.
 College students nationwide have been brought up and mobilized to speed up the completion of these massive construction projects. The North aims to flaunt its capabilities and achievements to the outside world by these projects.
 In the process, the regime allegedly offered a favor to students of wealthy families by permitting them to dodge the obligation. The impoverished country also said to confiscate foreign currency from its 24 million people to fund the preparation of the fancy event.
 The cash-strapped country has worked on the 105-story Ryukyong Hotel’s interior, which was left unfinished in downtown Pyongyang for nearly 20 years due to a lack of funds. In 2008, the North resumed construction of a skyscraper thanks to financing from Egypt’s Orascom Telecom, the sole mobile phone network operator in the isolated communist country. 
The construction of apartment buildings in Pyongyang is also being rushed.
According to Yonhap News, the North completed the framework of the apartment buildings in about four months, causing concerns over the safety of the buildings. As long as the possibility of the collapse remains, residents will be reluctant to move in the new apartments, added the report.
