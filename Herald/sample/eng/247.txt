Korea develops world’s fastest unmanned aerial vehicle
South Korea succeeded in producing the world’s fastest remote-controlled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
 “It’s unique ‘rotary wings,’ allow the aircraft to vertically take off and land, like a regular helicopter,” officials from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy stated.
 The Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Korea Aerospace Research Institute, private businesses and research centers have worked together toward the development of the unmanned aerial vehicle since 2002.
 “This is the world’s first UAV with such capabilities and the world’s fastest UAV, with a cruise speed of 400 kilometers per hour, twice as fast as an helicopter,” Nam Ki-man, a ministry official, said.
 According to Yonhap News, the world’s best-known UAV, the U.S. Air Force’s Predator, has a cruise speed of 135 kilometers per hour, and a maximum speed of about 217 kilometers per hour.
 The development of the aerial vehicle will be completed in March, 2012 and may also be sold for personal use later.
