Traditional Swiss ski season postponed
Global warming rears its ugly head again as Switzerland deals with snow-free slopes, putting a damper on the traditional start of the ski season; the first weekend of December.
Veronique Kanel, a spokeswoman for Swiss Tourism told AP that “should there not be snow until mid-December we will have a problem.” 
The unusually dry weather and high temperatures have caused many ski resorts to rely heavily on snow cannons to cover up the slopes with artificial snow. 
According to the World Meteorological Organization, Switzerland is currently on track to suffer one of its driest years on record.
