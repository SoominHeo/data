Creative thinkers more likely to cheat
Creative people are more likely to cheat in a situation that involves money than the less-imaginative crowd, a new study suggests.
 According to the study, creative people are better at creating justifying grounds to their unethical behaviors. 
 Researchers measured the creativity of 97 students from local universities in the southeastern United States and conducted five experiments to determine whether creative ones are more likely to cheat under certain circumstances.
 Participants took a quiz, and scientists told them that they would be paid more for correct answers. The group was then led to believe that they were able to cheat without getting caught; then a surprising result came out. People who were found to be more creative from the previous test were significantly more likely to cheat on the quiz than those who were a bit less creative.
 “Creative sparks may lead individuals to take unethical routes when searching for solutions to problems and tasks,” a study scientist Francesca Gino of Harvard University stated.
 The study noted that, “being able to generate several original justifications for one’s own unethical actions thanks to creativity may lead people to feel licensed to cheat.”
