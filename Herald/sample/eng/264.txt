‘Donation angel’ posthumously awarded presidential citation
President Lee Myung-bak posthumously awarded a presidential citation to a Chinese food delivery man who was known to donate part of his salary to help needy children.
Kim Woo-soo died from a motorcycle crash last September while working on a delivery run. His monthly pay was reportedly only around 700,000 won. 
Kim was called a “donation angel,” by various media. President Lee hosted a luncheon for about 200 volunteer workers and awarded state decorations to 24 of them, including Kim.
“The role of volunteer workers in sharing love and hope is important in propping up society,” Lee was quoted as saying during the event.
