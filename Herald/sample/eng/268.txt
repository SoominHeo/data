Teenage hostage escapes gunmen in southern Philippines Kevin Lunsmann, aged 14 was found wandering in a southern Philippine jungle on Dec. 10, five-months after he had been kidnapped by the al-Qaida-linked militant group, Abu Sayyaf. 
Lunsmann was captured on July 12 by militants during a family vacation, along with his Filipino-American mother and Filipino cousin on an island near Zamboanga City. The captors called family members in Campbell County, Virginia to demand a ransom, officials told AP. 
The mother was freed two months ago and the cousin escaped from captors last month when Filipino soldiers managed to get near an Abu Sayyaf camp in the mountains of Basilan, where the hostages were being held. 
“In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations,” U.S. Ambassador Harry Thomas said in a statement. “I also want to acknowledge the courage of Kevin himself, and his family throughout this long ordeal.”
