Will Mount Baekdu erupt?
Experts have warned that eruptions of volcanic Mount Baekdu in North Korea may happen. Citing topographical signs and satellite images, experts cautioned that the North’s Mount Baekdu, which borders China, might have an active core. Mount Baekdu, the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula, stands at 2,744-meters and last erupted in 1903.
 “Pyongyang is trying to calm the public over widespread eruption speculations and drawing international support for its disaster-prevention efforts,” Seoul’s Unification Ministry commented.
 After an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan last year, the communist regime proposed a rare meeting and experts from the two Koreas held talks on potential volcanic activity at Mount Baekdu in March and April.
 The Korean Central News Agency of North Korea also noted that Pyongyang recently adopted a new law to oversee and minimize damage from natural disasters.
