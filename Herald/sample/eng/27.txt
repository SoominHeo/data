President Lee addresses nation on Liberation Day
In commemoration of the 66th Liberation Day, President Lee Myung-bak gave an address to people with his future hopes and aspirations for the country.
 First of all, he urged Japan to teach history properly to the young generation. 　“Japan has a responsibility to teach its young generation the truth about what happened in the past.”
 He added that young people in Korea and Japan could forge ahead into the new era only when they appreciate their history as it is.
 The president also presented “ecosystemic development" as Korea’s new path. 　“What is now being demanded is a new model of market economy that evolves from greedy management to ethical management; from the freedom of capital to the responsibility of capital.”
 Lee also said that South Korea’s reunification with North Korea was the greatest issue in modern Korean history.
 “Reunification would be the perfection of national liberation,” he said.
 “Over the past 60 years, the South and North have lived in conflict. Now is the time to overcome it and open up an age of peace and cooperation.”
 The president promised to continue humanitarian assistance for children in the North as well as support to help the impoverished country recover from natural disasters.
 The president also emphasized that the current market economy must evolve. He said that the world economy faced a string of problems such as the global fiscal crisis, food and energy crises, soaring consumer prices, and the wide gap between the rich and poor.
 Lee also called for the parliament’s prompt ratification of the free trade agreement with the United States.
 “If we lose more time, we may lag behind competing nations. The government has prepared remedial measures to address some relevant issues. The treaty must be ratified for the future of the Republic,” he said.
