Gulf leaders meet for first time since Arab Uprisings
On Dec. 19, leaders of Gulf Arab nations met for a summit in Saudi Arabia for the first time since the Arab Uprisings earlier this year. 
High on the agenda of the meeting were the crisis in Syria and rising tensions with Iran. Gulf Arab officials have pushed for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to sign an Arab League peace deal aimed at ending the crackdown on protests in the nation in hopes of avoiding a civil war. 
Other points of discussion include the status on an aid package from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for Oman and Bahrain, as well as the request for development aid for impoverished nations like Yemen.
