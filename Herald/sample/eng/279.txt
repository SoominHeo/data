Aung San Suu Kyi back in political sphere
More than a year since she was released from house arrest Aung San Suu Kyi has re-started her political career by taking part in the forthcoming by-elections in Myanmar. 
The official voting emblem for the National League for Democracy (NLD), Suu Kyi’s political party, was unveiled recently, as reported by The Telegraph on Dec. 12. 
According to The Telegraph, Win Htein, a senior member of NLD said that the image, “similar to the party’s flag ... is a symbol of the country’s struggle for change.”
 “In our new seal, the white star represents revolution. It was used many years ago as a revolutionary symbol,” Htein said.
 Emblems are used as visual symbols during elections in Myanmar so as not to alienate those voters unable to read.
