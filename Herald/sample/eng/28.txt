Second-term Ban visits motherland
U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon visited his homeland Korea for the first time since he was re-elected as the Secretary General.
 During his 6-day visit from Aug. 9-14, Ban met with key government officials including President Lee and Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan, shared his expertise with aspiring university students, and enjoyed his time with many old friends back in his home town of Eumseong in North Chungcheong Province.
 Upon his arrival at Gimpo International Aiport, the U.N. chief said that his reelection had come at a significant time as it coincided with the 20th anniversary of South Korea‘s admission to the United Nations.
 At a model U.N. conference that he kicked off on Aug. 11, Mr. Ban gave strong words of encouragement to the participating university and graduate students. More than 600 students from some 60 countries were present at the mock conference dubbed “Sustainable Development: Advancing Human Progress in Harmony with Nature.”
 He told the participants, “You will soon be the government officials who negotiate peace; the community leaders who will help feed and shelter the vulnerable; the entrepreneurs and innovators who will get carbon emissions under control; the lawyers and human rights defenders who fight injustice, impunity and intolerance.”
 On Aug. 12, Mr. Ban visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade where he first started his official duty in 1970.
 After meeting with the Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan, Ban had a dialogue with some 300 officials of the ministry in the auditorium on the second floor.
 To his junior diplomats, Ban explained in detail how his four and a half years in the U.N. had proceeded.　
 “During the first tenure, I was faced with many hardships, but they were not too hard to deal with,” he said.
 He added that he had worked with a strong sense of sincerity, tenacity and principle and that he had always tried to take the initiative when he considered it necessary.
