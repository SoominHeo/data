Chinese fishermen’s pirate fishing operations
President Lee Myung-bak ordered “strong” measures to stop illegal fishing by Chinese boats in South Korea’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and the fishermen’s over- the-top violence toward the Korean Coast Guard. 
 A 41-year-old Coast Guard officer, Lee Cheong-ho, was stabbed to death by the captain of a Chinese fishing boat during a raid in the Yellow Sea. Another Korean Coast Guard was seriously wounded.
 Chinese vessels have increasingly been poaching in Korean waters and the tragedy was somewhat expected considering the level of tension in the exclusive area.
 The Chinese skipper and other eight crew members were arrested on charges of murder and obstructing government affairs.
 This year alone, Coast Guard has captured a total of 472 Chinese vessels for illegal fishing.
 “The government demanded an apology from Beijing and prevent such an incident from happening again,” Seoul’s foreign ministry spokesman Cho Byung-jae said.
