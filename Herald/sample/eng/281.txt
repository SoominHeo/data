Korea’s policy priorities for 2012: Trade and Job
Korean government’s top policy priorities for next year continue to be jobs and the promotion of trade, the administration said on Dec. 15. 
 Korea’s trade volume soared to more than $1 trillion this year for the first time in the country’s history, becoming the world’s ninth nation to perform a feat.
 The Korea International Trade Association projected South Korea’s exports will reach $600.5 billion in 2012, up 7.8 percent from this year’s estimation.
 Korea also aims to create jobs, aiming at 20,000 new jobs in the public sector, and 400,000 new jobs in small and medium-sized businesses by 2015.
 Earlier, the Finance Ministry slashed its growth outlook for 2012 to 3.7 percent from 4.5 percent, citing “continued uncertainties from the eurozone fiscal debt crisis and a possible global recession.”
