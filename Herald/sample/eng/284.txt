Obesity-related illnesses on the rise in Korea
Obesity-related illnesses, such as diabetes and strokes, are expected to raise South Korea’s medical bills to 3.4 trillion won this year, nearly double the amount from 2005, says a report by Inje University’s research team. 
 The medical cost hikes are in line with the country’s rising obesity rate, the report found. Total medical expenses and opportunity costs were included in the calculation. 
 South Korea’s obesity rate rose from 26.3 percent in 1998 to 31.7 percent in 2005. According to the National Health Insurance, Social costs of obesity-related illnesses amounted to nearly 1.8 trillion won in 2005.
 “Medical costs of obesity currently represent about 2.2 percent of the country’s total medical expenses, which shows little difference from those of developed nations, including the United States,” said professor Kang Jae-heon, the professor in charge of the research. “The country must continue to work to prevent and cure obesity.”
