The remains of tiny shells
The material we call “chalk” had its beginnings during the time when dinosaurs lived on Earth. At that time the oceans were rising higher and higher until finally they covered most of the Earth’s land.
 In those oceans lived billions of tiny animals. They were so small you could not have seen them -- even smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. These tiny creatures had shells made of the element calcium. When these animals died, their shells fell to the bottom of the oceans. After thousands of years there were many layers of shells on the ocean floor.
 As more and more of the tiny shells pressed down from the top, those on the bottom became harder and began to stick together.
 Eventually the shells changed into a mineral called “calcite,” the main ingredient of the rock known as “limestone.”
 Many millions of years passed after the first chalk was made. The Earth’s surface changed its shape, and the land and sea developed new shorelines. This left many chalk layers on dry land, both in the middle of continents and along coastlines. In some parts of England there are chalk cliffs 800 feet high.
 These are the famous White Cliffs of Dover, and they are almost solid chalk!
 If you had a piece of chalk from those cliffs, you could use it to write on a chalkboard. But the chalk that you now use in classrooms is not a piece dug from the cliffs or the ground. It is made in factories by mixing several other materials together.
