The Adventures of Tintin makes it to the Hollywood big screen
The Hollywood adaptation of the classic comic book series "The Adventures of Tintin" opened in theaters across the nation on Dec. 7. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie helps to introduce the comic book series and show why it was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. 
Available for viewing in 3-D, the animated action film provides a more life-like depiction of the comic book characters. One of my favorite scenes of the movie had to be Spielberg’s homage to the original creator of the series, Hergé, during the opening scene where an artist paints Tintin’s portrait in the likeness of his comic book counterpart. The artist was created to look like that of the late creator, Hergé, who asks Tintin, “Your face is very familiar. Have I sketched you before?” to which he replies, “Occasionally.” 
This type of witty banter is present all throughout the film, but what is more impressive than the dialogue is the quality of the images in the movie. 
Movie critic Neely Swanson of EasyReader wrote “Spielberg and [Peter] Jackson used motion-capture technology to create animation that truly leaps off the screen ... giving life and breath to comic characters that close the gap between real and imagined.” 
Indeed I would occasionally find myself having to remember that it is indeed an animated film, and not one of live action. The movie itself is very family-friendly, with a storyline that would captivate any child with tales of treasures and adventure, and witty dialogue to entertain any adult with a quick sense of humor. 
For any child or adult with a longing for adventure and any fan of the Tintin series, this movie is definitely worth checking out.
