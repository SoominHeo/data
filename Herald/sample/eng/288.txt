The Adventures of Tintin
The Adventures of Tintin is a series of classic comic books created by the Belgian artist Georges Remi (1907-1983). Under the pen name Hergé, Remi began publishing the series in French in Le Petit Vingtième, a children’s version of a Belgian newspaper, on Jan. 10, 1929. The story is set in the 20th century, where the hero, Tintin, is a young Belgian reporter who finds himself in a series of adventures along with his faithful dog, Snowy. Other popular characters include the rich but cynical Captain Haddock, the highly intelligent but slightly deaf Professor Calculus, and the rather incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson. 
The well thought-out plots and diversity in genres made The Adventures of Tintin a global sensation. As the most popular European comics of the 20th century, The Adventures of Tintin has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 50 languages.
