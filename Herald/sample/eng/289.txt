POSCO honorary chairman dies
Park Tae-joon, founder and honorary chairman of World’s top steelmaker POSCO, also dubbed the steel king of South Korea, died on Dec. 14. He was 84.
 “Many people will remember him,” said President Lee Myung-bak expressing his sorrow at Park’s death. “It was impossible for POSCO to be competitive without the dedicated leadership of the prominent Park Tae-joon,” the steelmaker said in a statement.
 Park had been admitted to Yonsei University’s Severance Hospital, in Seoul. The cause of death was confirmed as lung disease.
 Park established Pohang Iron & Steel Co., POSCO’s predecessor, in the southeastern port city of Pohang in 1968. He started POSCO on President Park Chung-hee’s orders and led the company until 1993. Then he was forced to resign under pressure from then President Kim Young-sam, who used to be his political rival prior to his inauguration as president.
 Since then, under Park’s leadership, POSCO grew to become one of the world’s largest steel makers. The company helped its country rise from the ashes and impoverishment from the Korean War to become an economic powerhouse. Park has been regarded as the godfather of Korea’s steel industry and an icon for the country’s economic growth and industrialization.
 Besides his career as an inspiring entrepreneur, Park also ventured into politics in 1980. He won a parliamentary seat the following year and served as a four-term lawmaker in politics. He even worked as prime minister in the administration of former President Kim Dae-jung.
 Since 2002, Park has been the honorary chairman of POSCO. He is survived by his wife, Chang Ok-ja, one son and four daughters. Park was born on Sept. 29, 1927, in Jangan, now part of Busan, the port city in southeastern South Korea. 
 His funeral was held at the National Cemetery on Dec. 17. The country paid for his burial in recognition of his contribution to the country’s economic enhancement.
