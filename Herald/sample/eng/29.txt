2011 IAAF World Championships in Daegu
Following the 1988 Olympic Games and the 2002 Football World Cup, Korea is set to host another major international sporting event - The 13th edition of the International Association of Athletics Federation Championships in Daegu. The Championships will take place from Aug. 27 to Sept. 4. More than 2,000 athletes from over 200 countries are expected to compete in 47 events (24 for men, 23 for women). For nine days, the eyes of the sporting world will be focused on the star-studded event featuring some of the greatest athletes in the world. Here’s a list of athletes and events to watch:
 Usain Bolt (men’s 100m/200m) - Usain Bolt has been the world’s most high-profile athlete since he burst onto the scene in the Beijing Olympics with his electrifying, record-smashing performances in the 100 meter and 200 meter races. His over-the-top celebration even before he crossed the finish line to set the new standard of 9.58 seconds in the 100 meter race in Beijing not only catapulted him to superstardom, but it also hinted at the possibility that he could run even faster. The stage is set in Daegu for Bolt’s heroics, but in order to emerge victorious, or set a new world record, he must contend with fellow countryman Asafa Powell, who owns the year’s world-leading time of 9.78 seconds. In the 200 meter race, Bolt is likely to face a challenge from the up-and-coming American sprinter Walter Dix, although his personal best time of 19.69 pales in comparison to Bolt’s world record time of 19.19.
 Yelena Isinbayeva (women’s pole vault) - Yelena Isinbayevaor Russia is a superstar in the world of athletics and the greatest female pole-vaulter of all time. She is a two-time Olympic gold medalist (2004 and 2008), a five-time World Champion, and the current world record holder in the event. She is the only woman to clear the five-meter barrier, both indoors and outdoors, and she set the world record in the event on 27 occasions. Isinbayeva was named Female Athlete of the Year by the IAAF in 2004, 2005 and 2008, and World Sportswoman of the Year in 2007 and 2009. Yelena Isinbayeva is a crowd favorite wherever she goes not just because of her athletic achievements. She is also a very charismatic, elegant and charming lady. Spectators in Daegu are in for a real treat -- The Queen is in the house!
 Dayron Robles/Liu Xiang/David Oliver (men’s 110-meter hurdles) - The men’s 110-meter hurdles is likely to be a hotly-contested event among history’s three fastest men. The current world record of 12.87 seconds is owned by Cuba’s Robles, the reigning Olympic champion. China’s Liu Xiang, a world champion (Osaka 2007) and Olympic champion (Athens 2004), owns the second best time in history at 12.88 seconds. Liu has recovered from the injury that caused him to withdraw from the Beijing Olympics and has shown improved form in recent competitions where he topped out at 13.0 seconds. American David Oliver owns the third best time in history at 12.89 seconds. He clocked the 2011 world-leading time of 12.94 seconds in defeating Liu Xiang in an event in Eugene, Oregon earlier this year. It would not be a surprise to find all three men on the medals podium.
 Kenenisa Bekele (men’s 5,000m/10,000m) - Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia is a long distance runner with no one able to match him. One year after his double gold medal performance in the 5,000 meters and the 10,000 meters races at the Beijing Olympics, he won double gold over the same distances in the world championships in Germany. He became the first man to take both the long distance track gold medals at the same World Championships -- an amazing feat that even legendary runner and fellow Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie could not achieve in his distinguished career. Bekele currently owns the world records in both the 5,000 and 10,000. Including World Cross Country team titles, the 27-year-old has won an incredible total of 24 world championship gold medals. 
USA vs. Jamaica (women’s 100 meters /200 meters) - The pursuit for the title of “the fastest woman in the world” will likely pit Jamaica’s Veronica Campbell-Brown against America’s Carmelita Jeter. Campbell-Brown was the world champion in the 100 meters in 2007, and has improved her personal best to 10.76 seconds this year. Jeter has been the top 100 meters sprinter in the world over the past few years, and her personal best time of 10.64 ranks as the second fastest in history. However, Campbell-Brown has defeated Jeter in two recent meetings and holds a life-time head-to-head record of 17-6 against the American. In the 200 meters, both Campbell-Brown and Jeter will be looking to dethrone American Allyson Felix, who is looking to win an unprecedented fourth consecutive 200 meters title. 
Oscar Pistorius (men’s 400m) - Known as the “Blade Runner”, Pistorius is a South African sprint runner and a double amputee. He runs with the aid of high-tech Cheetah Flex-Foot carbon fiber transtibial artificial limbs. He is the world record holder in the 100 meter, 200 meter and 400 meter sport class T44 events (paralympics events for single leg below knee amputation/combined lower plus upper limb amputations/ambulant with moderately reduced function in one or both lower limbs). Pistorius has lobbied for a long time to compete against able-bodied athletes in the Olympics and World Championship events, but his applications were denied due to concerns over possible unfair advantages his running blades might give him, as well as his failure to meet qualification standards. In 2008, the Court of Arbitration for Sports ruled that there was no evidence that Pistorius had any net advantage over able-bodied athletes, thereby clearing the way for him to compete. Pistorius qualified for Daegu and the 2010 Olympics in London with a time of 45.07 seconds (for comparison purposes, the Asian Games record for the men’s 400 is 44.93 seconds).
