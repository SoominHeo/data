Angry Birds set to take over the real world
In the era of trendy smart phones, the game Angry Birds has become a trend on its own. Plush toys, board games, a cookbook and even a knock-off attraction at a Chinese theme park have all been developed based on the simple game. The latest venture by Angry Birds developer Rovio, sees the game enter the real world in a collaboration with Finnish playground maker Lappset. 
In a press release by Lappset on Dec. 12, the two companies have planned a joint project to provide Angry Birds-themed playground equipment worldwide. The first of these activity parks will be built in Rovaniemi and Espoo in Finland by next year, with hopes to bring it worldwide.
 Angry Birds is a simple enough game, released by Finnish game developer Rovio in 2009. To everyone’s surprise, the nonsensical game of “catapulting whimsical birds into absurd fortresses built by little green pigs who have stolen the birds’ eggs” became the most popular paid application in the Apple App Store, not to mention more than a half-billion downloads on other devices, AFP reported. 
“The activity parks perfectly a tie in with the Angry Birds world and our way of thinking,” says Rovio’s chief marketing officer Peter Vesterbacka.
 “We will be developing a service which brings together the digital world and the physical world in a way that’s never been seen before. The popularity of Angry Birds isn’t restricted to any age, sex or social group, and the activity parks too will be designed to be interesting places for absolutely everyone, all around the world.”
 In total, around 20 products will be designed by Lappset, including animal spring riders, swings, sandpits and a range of climbing towers with slides. Ready-made playground sets, inspired by the color scheme of the Angry Birds game environment, are also being developed for “outdoor spaces of different sizes.”
