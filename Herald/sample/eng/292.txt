Russians stage massive protest against Putin
Tens of thousands of Russians launched a massive protest on Dec. 24, asking Prime Minsiter Vladimir Putin to end his 12-year rule and leave, AP news said.
 The demonstration that occupied a Moscow avenue was the largest in scale since the one which brought down the Soviet Union 20 years ago, AP news explained.
 The protesters urged Putin to follow the example of Mihkail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, who left in 1991 while closing down the Soviet Union.
 Putinâ€™s United Russia party lost 25 percent of its seats in the parliamentary election on Dec. 4, but it hung onto a majority in parliament. The protesters believe that election fraud was behind the result.
