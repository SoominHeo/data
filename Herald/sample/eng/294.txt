Former first lady crosses border to the North
Former South Korean first lady Lee Hee-ho crossed the inter-Korean border into the North on Dec. 26, along with Hyundai Group chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun, to pay respects to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
 The delegations led by the two ladies passed the military demarcation line and were greeted by 12 North Korean officials at the North‘s passage inspection center. North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency also said on Dec. 26 that Lee and Hyun’s delegations had arrived in Pyongyang via Gaeseong.
 Later in the day, Lee and Hyun visited the Kumsusan Memorial Palace where the deceased Kim Jong-il was laid and offered condolences.
 South Korea‘s Unification Ministry said that the S. Korean government had allowed civilian delegations to visit North Korea to improve inter-Korean relations and that it had considered South Korean public sentiment.
