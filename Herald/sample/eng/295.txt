Donations to Korean Salvation Army break record
Korea’s Salvation Army kettles collected around 5 billion won in 2011, breaking the charity’s annual record in spite of the slow economy at home and abroad.
 An official from the Salvation Army Korea Territory said in an interview with Yonhap News that the total amount donated had already surpassed that of 2010 (4.2 billion won) on Dec. 26.
 Considering the donations which had not been counted, the total is expected to exceed the 4.5 billion won goal for the 2011 campaign and reach 4.6 billion won, the official said.
 According to Yonhap News, an anonymous donor dropped a check for 110 million won into a kettle in Myeong-dong, central Seoul -- the largest amount of money in a single donation raised by the street collection.
