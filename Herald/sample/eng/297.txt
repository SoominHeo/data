Japan to allocate record budget for land recovery
Disaster-struck Japan is ready to issue a record-high budget to help recover from last year’s earthquake and tsunami, AP news said.
 Japan’s cabinet on Dec. 24 approved the budget plan for 2012, and a total of 96 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion) will be spent to recover from the natural disasters.
 The government funds will be used to pay for the massive cost of disaster recovery in northeastern Japan and decontamination efforts to deal with radiation leaked from nuclear power plants.
 The Japanese government is reducing spending for developing atomic energy instead, but it will need to spend much more than the amount saved to close down Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, AP news explained.
