Two moons become one
AP reported a new theory recently, stating the possibility that Earth once had more than one moon. Some astronomers now believe that our current moon used to have a smaller, sister moon, and that the two collided with each other about 4.4 billion years ago. 
This theory, published in the Aug. 3 issue of the journal Nature, is simply an attempt to explain why the surface of the far side of the moon is so vastly different from the one always facing Earth. 
Co-authors Erik Asphaug, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Martin Jutzi of the University of Bern in Switzerland, hypothesize that the gravitational pull of the bigger moon caused the smaller moon to be drawn to it, creating a low-velocity collision. This “low-velocity” collision occurred at more than 8,050 kph, which is considered very slow in astronomical terms. 
“The physics is really surprisingly similar to a pie in the face,” Asphaug explained, with the rocks and crust from the smaller moon spreading over and around the bigger moon, rather than melting or creating a crater, which a faster crash would have caused. The result is our “single bulked-up and ever-so-slightly lopsided moon,” AP writes.
