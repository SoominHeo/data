Bio battery turns paper into electricity
An eco-friendly, paper-powered battery prototype was unveiled by global electronics company Sony at the Eco-Products exhibition in Tokyo.
 At the exhibition, children were invited to drop a piece of paper into a liquid made up of water and enzymes and shake it. A few minutes later, a small fan connected to the equipment began to spin. The simple process generated electricity. 
 The enzyme inside the liquid helped decompose the paper into sugar, which then released electrons and hydrogen ions. These were then used as an energy source, explained the engineers from Sony at the event. 
 Still, the paper-based bio batteries are not ready to be produced for sale in shops.
 “Of course, this is still at the very early stages of its development, but when you imagine the possibilities that this technology could deliver, it becomes very exciting indeed.” said Yuichi Tokita, senior researcher at Sony‘s Advanced Material Research Lab. 
 Researchers at Sony’s laboratory are confident that these batteries will play strongly on the market when commercialized as they are environmentally friendly products. Nowadays people are more conscious about the environment and with the technology, people could easily turn trash into energy. 
 “Using a ‘fuel’ as simple as old greetings cards -- the sort of cards that millions of us will be receiving this Christmas -- the bio battery can deliver enough energy to power a small fan,” said Yuichi Tokita.
 Environment group, Greenpeace welcomed the idea. “Any way to provide a greener technology could be a potential magic bullet. So from that point of view this is interesting, and I think it‘s fantastic that companies like Sony are looking to make the generation of energy more environmentally friendly.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace U.K.
