Our language destroyed...
All of these are Korean words used on the Internet. Have you ever used or seen this interesting language on the internet? These are examples of how the Korean language has been destroyed.
 In Korea, we have the fastest online network, but there are some problems that are now attacking our language. 
Most of you use Twitter or Facebook. Think again about whether or not you shortened Korean words like ㅇ or ㅋ. Most of you can see this type of language on online games or websites. Also we use this shortened language on our phones with text messages.
 One advantage of this internet language is that we can use it comfortably in messages or chatting, but it can also destroy our Korean language. We have to protect our language because the language is our identity. We can all try to do something to prevent the destruction of our language. 
First, we should use our original language online and chatting. It’s hard to type, and conversations can be longer but we have to work hard to protect our own language. 
Second, we have to speak using our original language. Many of these internet languages have bad meanings like ㄲㅈ or ㄷㅊ, and we use these words to curse on internet sites or online games. Many students today curse using these types of words. We should prevent these occurrences. 
If we are careful about this type of language use, we can keep our language safe. Most importantly we have to protect our language for Korea’s future and also for our children in the future.
