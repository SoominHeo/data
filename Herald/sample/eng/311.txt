Russia criticizes U.S. for its human rights record
Russia’s Foreign Ministry has recently published a report on human rights abuses around the world, wherein it criticizes the U.S. for its human rights record. The report offers such examples as the Guantanamo Bay prison and wrongful death row convictions “to paint the U.S. as hypocritical for lecturing other nations on the subject of rights,” AP reports. 
The report, which was published on Dec. 28, states that “The situation in the United States is a far cry from the ideals that Washington proclaims.”
 This 90-page Russian report comes as a reaction to the accusations by the U.S. State Department of human rights breaches in Russia. According to AP, the report “slams EU nations, Canada and Georgia, but reserves its longest section of 20 pages for what it says are violations by the United States.”
