New measure on school violence
The National Police Agency has issued guidelines for school bullying amid rampant violence at schools across the nation. 
 Commissioner General Cho Hyun-oh said the National Police Agency adopted new measures to eradicate school bullying. Under the new guidelines, local police stations are expected to receive direct briefings from the school violence task force that will be set up at police stations nationwide. 
When school bullying is reported, it is local police chiefsâ€™ obligation to send investigators to schools where bullying cases break out and provide anti-bullying lectures to students. 
 The guidelines also advise police to use the time most convenient for victims when questioning them, and secure qualified staff to come up with professional counseling programs for victims.
