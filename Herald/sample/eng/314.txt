U.S. cautious about North Korea’s new leader
The U.S. government expressed a caution about North Korea’s future leadership, Yonhap News reported. 
 Still, the U.S. government is said to be hopeful for continued dialogue with the reclusive regime under the new leadership. The U.S. is considering providing the North with large-scale food aid this year, which Washington calls “nutritional assistance.”
 State Department spokesman Mark Toner opined that North Korea has a “pretty opaque system,” and is “waiting for some signals from the North Koreans.” “ I think we will wait and see in coming days and weeks what else emerges,” he said.
 The North’s state media were quick to announce Kim Jong-un, late dear leader Kim Jong-il’s third son, known to be in his late 20s, as Pyongyang’s next leader.
