Wrapping up Hollywood 2011
The only industry that is seemingly untouched by the global financial crisis is entertainment. Despite the struggle by most -- individuals and countries alike - to keep afloat in today’s worldwide economic recession, entertainers such as singer Lady Gaga earned a reported $90 million in 2011 alone. In fact, Forbes listed Gaga as the highest-earning woman in music thanks to strong album sales, endorsement deals and “an extremely lucrative world tour.” Next in line were Taylor Swift and Katy Perry with $45 million and $44 million, respectively.
