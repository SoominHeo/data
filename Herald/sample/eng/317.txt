Alaska seals to test for radiation
Scientists are investigating whether seals in Alaska were made sick by radiation from Japan’s crippled Fukushima nuclear plant, according to Reuters.
 Ring seals have been found washed up on Alaska’s Arctic coastline since the summer of 2011. “They seem to suffer from a mysterious disease marked by bleeding lesions on the hind flippers, irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the fur,” the report stated.
 Biologists predicted early on that the seals were suffering from a virus, but unable to identify one; they began an experiment whether radiation from Japan might have played the part.
 “We recently received samples of seal tissue from diseased animals captured near St. Lawrence Island with a request to examine the material for radioactivity,” remarked John Kelley, Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
 Local communities have speculated that the seals’ abrupt sickness has something to do with the damage from Fukushima nuclear reactors. 
“There is concern expressed by some members of the local communities,” Kelley stated.
 In search of the cause of the diseased seals, water tests to find any evidence of elevated radiation in U.S. Pacific waters have been carried out by Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Japan’s March earthquake and tsunami caused multiple fuel meltdowns at the Fukushima plant.
