Pohang International Fireworks Festival
The Pohang International Fireworks Festival lasted for four days from July 28 to 31 at Bukbu Beach. 900,000 people went to Bukbu Beach, and the beach welcomed them by presenting them with splendid fireworks. 85,000 fireworks were used during the festival.
 China’s Sunny got the 1st place during the festival by earning 155 points from citizens of Pohang and 461 points from the fireworks specialists. China’s theme was “Jasmine Flower in summer.” 
Portugal’s Macedos took second place with a total of 529 points. Australia, which showed its fireworks first, had to settle for third place. The Korean team ended the festival with an appealing show. 
The festival didn’t only show fireworks. It also had singing and dancing contests and light parades. Additionally, there was a musical about fire and light.
 I live in Pohang. I thought that Pohang was not a well-known, big city. Also, I thought there was nothing to be proud of about Pohang. After watching this festival, I knew that Pohang was a well known city. Also, my cousin came from Canada to watch this festival. I did not expect this festival to be so popular.
