Marie Curie, pioneer on radioactivity
Marie Skłodowska-Curie was a physicist and chemist well known for her pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first person and first woman to be honored with two Nobel Prizes -- for physics and chemistry. 
 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, “in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena.” She also won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.
 Marie Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland in Nov. 7, 1867. She studied at Warsaw‘s clandestine Floating University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, at the age of 24, she followed her older sister to study in Paris. She later became the first female professor at the University of Paris.
 Her achievements include isolating radioactive isotopes and the discovery of two new elements: polonium and radium. The first chemical element she isolated in 1898 was “polonium.” She named in honor of her native country, Poland. She and her husband announced the existence of another element on Dec. 26, 1898, which together they named “radium,” in reference to its intense radioactivity.
 The discovery of radium provided people with a source of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. Through her pioneering discovery, for the first time in the history of science, the nuclear atom was postulated. The radioactivity of radium provided a means to successfully attack cancer. The treatment of neoplasms also became possible by using radioactive isotopes. Her contribution to science reshaped people’s lives.
 In 1932, Curie founded Radium Institutes in Paris and in her home town, Warsaw, which today remain major centers of medical research. She died on July 4, 1934 of aplastic anemia due to her years of exposure to radiation.
