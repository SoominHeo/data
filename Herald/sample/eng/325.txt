‘Diplomatic Academy’ to be launched next year
The implementation of the new system will bring an end to the decades-old government exam starting 2013. The current exam has been criticized for failing to discover talented government employees.
 “The Diplomatic Academy is aimed at recruiting and training talented diplomats from diverse backgrounds,” a senior official at the Foreign Ministry explained. The academy will select candidates “through simplified written tests, and multi-stage and multi-layer verification.” 
 The establishment of the national diplomatic academy is set for March, 2013 and successful candidates will go through one year of training. In the end, 50 out of 60 candidates will be hired as foreign service officials.
