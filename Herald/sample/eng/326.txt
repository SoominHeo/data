Revision of high school textbooks
The Education Ministry approved a set of new guidelines for nation’s high school history textbooks. The updated textbooks will touch on Korea’s sad historical subjects, such as the　"comfort women" who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.
 The new textbooks will describe how Japan “intensely drafted [Korean] workers, soldiers and comfort women for the Japanese military during the Pacific War,” the ministry stated. 
 The guidelines also say textbooks must cover major democratic movements in modern Korea, such as the May 18 Democratic Movement and a popular uprising by Gwangju citizens against President Chun Doo-hwan’s dictatorship in 1980.
Last month, the ministry was criticized by liberal historians for failing to include the nation’s major historical events in middle school textbooks.
 　 The new textbooks will be available from 2014.
