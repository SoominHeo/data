Adolescent immigrants having a hard time adapting in Korea
Adolescent immigrants living in Korea are reported to have difficulty adjusting to the society, with nearly 80 percent of them doing without proper schooling.
 The report by the Seoul Foundation of Women and Family was more than depressing. Only 21.7 percent of 875 immigrants living in the metropolitan area aged 7 to 18 were enrolled in elementary or secondary schools as of July. The percentage of middle- and high-school-aged children attending schools fell to 18.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while more than 50 percent of primary school-age students were enrolled during the same period. 
 Yet the report showed that most of these immigrants came to the country in their mid teens. 
 Jang Myung-sun from the Seoul Foundation of Women and Family points out that current Korean government’s support system for multicultural families falls short of providing effective and comprehensive assistance to those in need. It fails to cover adolescent immigrants. Jang says that most of the administration’s assistance programs for children of immigrant families are only relevant to much younger kids, such as kindergarteners and preschoolers. 
 “The chances are that those adolescent immigrants have difficulty in adopting themselves to society, as they have less opportunity to learn the Korean language prior to joining a school here and their complicated family relations often make circumstances unstable for them,” Jang said in an interview with Yonhap News. “The city government needs to make diverse measures such as providing them with language-learning programs, counseling services and work opportunities.” 
 According to the data from the Justice Ministry, a total of 5,726 youths under the age of 20 applied for naturalization in Korea by 2010, with 34 percent of them residing in Seoul. More than 90 percent of them came from China, followed by Mongolia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
