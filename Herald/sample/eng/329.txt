Japanese businessman to restore ancient Roman pyramid
An Italian daily newspaper, La Repubblica, recently reported that a Japanese businessman has agreed to help restore a 2,000-year-old pyramid in Rome, Italy. 
Yuzo Yagi is the fashion business owner from Osaka who has agreed to invest 1 million euros ($1.3 million) in the restoration of the pyramid. Officials say that the pyramid was built in 18-12 B.C. as a tomb for Gaius Cestius, a wealthy Roman at the time. 
According to La Repubblica, Yagiâ€™s only request for his contribution is to have a plaque with his name on it near the monument once it is restored.
