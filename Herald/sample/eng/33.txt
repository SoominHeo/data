Man U for sale
Asian Manchester United fans may soon have the chance to show their support for the football club through partial ownership. 
BBC News reported on Aug. 18 that the owners of the internationally famous football club, Manchester United, are planning on selling off a significant stake in the club in Singapore to help pay off its gross debts of ￡515 million ($848.3 million). 
The U.S. based Glazer family currently has 100 percent ownership of the club, through a takeover bid that was widely criticized by fans, in 2005. According to BBC News, the purported sale of 25 to 30 percent of company ownership would ensure that “no outside person could take control of the club.” 
The money generated from the sale will help pay off the debt that was incurred by the Glazer family to finance their 2005 takeover of the club.
