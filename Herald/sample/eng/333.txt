Active children get higher marks
How well children perform in schools could be linked to how physically active they are, a review of previous studies suggests. 
Dutch Researchers reported in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine that they found strong evidence of a “significant positive relationship” between exercise and academic performance of school-age children.
 The report explains that exercise may help students develop sharper cognition by increasing blood and oxygen flow to the brain. As a consequence the report notes that “physically active students tend to show strong academic performance.”　
 The review looked at 14 studies, 10 observational and four interventional, which involved a total of more than 12,000 children between the ages of 6 and 18. Twelve of the studies were conducted in the United States, one in Canada and one in South Africa. Children and their parents were asked to note down how much exercise they were doing to create more objective result during the research.
 The review also argued that physical activity could even help children reduce stress by improving their mood and make them more likely to behave in the classroom.
 Dr. Singh said, “Children who learn to participate in sport also learn to obey rules. This may mean they are more disciplined and able to concentrate better during lessons.” 
“Children should be active for at least one hour a day, for health reasons. But we also need to look at other things, like what kind of activities they should do, when they should do them and for how long,” he added. 
 Dr. Singh revealed that people keep asking him "How much exercise do they need to do to get an A," which he doesn’t know yet.
 Authors of the previous study, from VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, put emphasis on the need for more accurate measurement instruments to firm up the relationship between physical activity and academic performance.
