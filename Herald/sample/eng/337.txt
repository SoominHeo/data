 Chico & Rita is a music-filled animated movie first set in Cuba in the year 1948. It is about a young piano player with big dreams, Chico, and a beautiful singer with an extraordinary voice, Rita. The two pursue dreams of uniting romance with music, from the anonymity of performing at random bars in Havana, to being thrust in the limelight by performing in concert halls all across the world. Chico and Rita’s story of love, heartbreak and success is set in the tradition of the Latin ballad, the bolero.
