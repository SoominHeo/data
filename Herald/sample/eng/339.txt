“Godfather” of South Korean democracy: Kim Geun-tae
Kim Geun-tae, a prominent liberal South Korean politician and famous democracy activist died at the age of 64 from a brain disease on Dec. 30. 
“Kim fought to achieve the country’s democracy under military governments with unflinching courage,” said a local report. 
When he was a student of Seoul National University, he protested against the military dictatorship and during the 1970s, he was repeatedly jailed and tortured. While in prison, Kim received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1987, together with his wife In Jae-keun, and was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. He was later released in 1988.
 Kim Geun-tae transformed himself into a lawmaker in 1996 and was re-elected twice. He served as head of South Korea’s former ruling Uri Party and became health minister in 2004 under the left-leaning government of President Roh Moo-hyun. He had long played a pivotal role in South Korea’s liberal bloc.
 Kim was once considered a potential candidate for president to succeed then president Roh, but he decided not to run in the 2007 presidential race. He had since served as a standing advisor for the main opposition Democratic Unity Party.
According to the report, Kim Geun-tae had battled Parkinson’s disease for the past five years -- thought to have been brought on by the aftereffects of torture he received during his imprisonment -- and had hospitalized in Seoul with symptoms of cerebral vein thrombosis for nearly a month.
 About 100 liberal politicians and activists attended his funeral to bid farewell and pay their respects to the democracy and labor rights’ activist.
 The ceremony was held at Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul on Jan. 3, presided over by Father Ham Se-woong. 
 He was laid to rest in a cemetery in northern Gyeonggi Province. Kim Geun-tae is survived by a son and a daughter.
