U.S. to offer humanitarian aid to N. Korea
The United States announced on Aug. 18 that it would provide $900,000 worth of emergency aid to help out flood-stricken North Korea.
 "In response to humanitarian needs arising from recent flooding in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the United States will provide emergency humanitarian assistance to DPRK,“ the State Department said in a press release. 
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will channel emergency relief supplies worth of $900,000 to the regions in the North, such as Gangwon and Hwanghae provinces, the areas that suffered the worst flood damages.
 “The U.S. is simply concerned about the well-being of the North Korean people,” Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Department spokeswoman said. She said the supplies would not include food, but housing equipment like plastic sheeting and tents.
 The South Korean government assured that the aid from the U.S. was “a pure humanitarian move” and prospect of the resumption of six-party talks, which have been stalled since December 2008 was bleak. 
On Aug. 22, U.S. and North Korea concluded their first nuclear talks in 19 months.
 North Korea experts predicted that Pyongyang wants to begin the denuclearization talks because of its wretched economic situation.
