Korea retakes status as world‘s top shipbuilder
Korea recovered the title of world’s No. 1 shipbuilder last year after defeating its archrival China, Jan. 10 data showed. 
 According to London-based market researcher Clarkson Research Services, Korean shipbuilding giants won 13.55 million compensated gross tons in new orders in 2011 while runner-up China snatched a disappointing 9.2 million CGTs.
 The report notes that garnering deals for large, value-added vessels made such feat possible.
 South Korea became the world’s top shipbuilding nation in 2003, but China, armed with cheap prices, outpaced Korea in the number of new orders in 2009 and 2010. Yet, Korean shipyards didn’t throw in the towel and sought a new solution on high-priced vessels and so far the measure has paid off, the report explained.
