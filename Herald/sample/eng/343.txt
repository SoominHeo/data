High school students’ favorite career path: teaching 　
Becoming a teacher is what South Korean high school students favor the most as their future job as Koreans put job security their top priority, a survey conducted by the Education Ministry showed. 
In a survey of 2,165 high school students, 11 percent picked teaching as their most preferred job, followed by civil service at 4.2 percent and joining the police at 4.1 percent.
 “As unemployment has become a nagging social problem, not only a growing number of job seekers but also high school students are looking to the public sector. It is deemed to guarantee greater job security,” said Kim Na-rah, an official at the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training.
 The country’s jobless rate among those aged 15 to 29 in November last year was 6.8 percent, government data showed.
