Tensions rising between Iran and West
Recent developments have caused more tensions in the already strained relationship between Iran and the West. 
Factors for the recent surge of tensions include an American sentenced to death in Tehran for spying, an apparent breakthrough in Iran’s nuclear program and Iran accusing Israel and the U.S. of being responsible for blowing up an Iranian nuclear scientist in his car. 
Despite the sanctions imposed on Iran by the international community, many experts still fear that Iran will begin “acquiring nuclear weapons and thereby foreclose either a regional war or a cascade of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East,” according to a letter written by several U.S. Senators.
