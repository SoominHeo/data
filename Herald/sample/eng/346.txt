Unapproved fungicide found in orange juice
Coca-Cola Co. alerted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it found that an unapproved fungicide was being used by some Brazilian growers who supply the ingredients used for its orange juice products. 
The fungicide appears to have been detected in not only Coca-Cola Co.’s products, but its competitors’ as well. 
The FDA has said it is now testing orange juice sold in supermarkets for the potentially harmful fungicide, carbendazim. FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey told the New York Times that as of Jan. 11, preliminary test results for three shipments of orange juice tested by the FDA have come back negative for the fungicide.
