Ancient elephants
Believe it or not, thousands of years ago some elephants wore heavy fur coats.
 Actually, the mammoth was an ancestor of the modern elephant. And mastodons were distant relatives of the mammoth. Neither animal is around today. But at one time they roamed the Earth in great numbers. 
We know a lot about these ancient creatures because scientists have found many frozen mammoth bodies, especially in the icy area of Russia known as Siberia. 
Both beasts largely died out at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. Mastodons and mammoths were a lot alike, but the mastodons were on the planet first. They appeared about 20 million years ago. They were smaller than mammoths and had thick legs like pillars. Mastodons were covered with long reddish brown hair. 
The mammoth didn’t show up until about 1.5 million years ago. Mammoths were the size of modern elephants. The woolly mammoth had a thick furry yellowish brown undercoat with longer bristly hair over it. 
Like the mastodon, the mammoth had small ears and very long tusks. Despite these dangerous tusks, both animals ate only grass and other plants. The tusks may have been for shoveling snow and ice to uncover food. 
Mastodons and mammoths were around at the same time as early humans. The people of the day hunted the animals, but hunting didn’t wipe them out. Scientists think that the mastodon and the mammoth vanished because the glaciers of the Ice Age destroyed much of the vegetation they relied on for food.
