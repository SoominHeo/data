The U.S. emphasizes again the importance of KORUS FTA
A high-ranking American official has stressed again how the free trade agreements between Korea and the U.S. would bolster the two respective economies, adding to their already strong political relationship.
 Tami Overby, Vice President of the American Chamber of Commerce, said that the bilateral trade pact would take the economic relationship between the two allies to the next level in an interview with the Korea Herald on Jan. 9.
 Pro-FTA experts predict that the trade deal would promote job growth of the U.S. and Korea at the same time and also expand market access to companies by eliminating bilateral tariffs. Overby said she disagrees with the ongoing argument that many jobs will be lost when the Korea-U.S. FTA goes effect soon.
 “This agreement will create jobs in both countries because it’s going to open up trade opportunities,” she said.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Korean Embassy in Washington are about to start their second phase in promoting the accord by visiting small and medium-sized companies in the United States to explain the advantages the deal. The Korean Embassy is currently headed by the Ambassador Han Duk-soo.
 “We will travel the U.S. helping companies take advantage of the new deal, making sure they understand what are the opportunities, how to use the FTA, what does it mean and highlighting success stories,” Overby said.
 During her one-day visit to Seoul, the biggest concern Overby has heard from her Korean counterparts has to do with the continued global economic difficulties and the challenges being posted in the European Union, the Korea Herald said. 
“The good news is in the U.S., we are seeing some positive signs, unemployment numbers of falling. This trade agreement will further help boost our economic growth, but about the FTA, I’m talking to [Korean] business people, a few [Korean] government officials, everyone is very excited,” she said.
