Samsung dominates European flat panel TV market
Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest TV maker kept its lead in the European TV market in the January-June period, an international market researcher reported on Aug. 18.
 Germany-based GfK Group said that Samsung accounted for 30.7 percent of the European flat-panel TV market, whereas its arch rival LG Electronics Inc., the world’s No. 2 TV maker, once again remained in the runner-up slot with a market share of 15.7 percent. The two Korean conglomerates were followed by Japan’s Sony Corp. and the Netherlands’ Philips Electronics in the European TV market. 
The flat panel TV market includes liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma display panel sets and in the LCD market alone, Samsung enjoyed an unequaled 31.0 percent whereas Sony and LG held a belittling 15.3 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively.
 Samsung also kept its lead in the premium light emitting diode and 3-D TV set markets with its shares reaching 34.9 percent and 46.3 percent each GfK said.
 The latest findings reaffirmed Samsung’s unparalleled status in the world’s high value-added TV market, the company claimed.
