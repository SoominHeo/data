Bamseom Island in Han River may make Ramsar list
Recognized for its phenomenal ecological and environmental value, Seoul’s Bamseom Island in the Han River, is poised to put up its name on the Ramsar Convention’s protection list, the Environment Ministry announced. 
 The ministry registered the island with the Ramsar Convention and the secretariat of the Ramsar Convention will decide whether to take the island a part of list after reviewing the island’s biodiversity and preservation values as early as April. 
 This rare urban habitat for migratory birds is located between the river’s largest island of Yeouido and the north shore of Mapo. The total area of the island comes to near 241,000 square meters.
 The naturally-formed alluvial island was split in two for a government construction project and the two parts have continued to collect sediment. This unique ecological feature helped scientists make a prediction of a natural succession of river wetlands. 
 The research by the Seoul Metropolitan Government concluded some 580 endangered and protected species including mandarin ducks, kestrels, brown hawk-owls, hawks, and bean geese inhabit in the Island.
 Signed in 1971, the Ramsar Convention is an inter-governmental treaty that calls on member countries to maintain the ecological value of their wetlands. South Korea joined the convention in 1997 and has 16 wetlands on the list.
 “Bamseom has served as a bridge between the mouth of the Han River and Seoul’s ecological system,” one ministry official said. “If designated, the island will help protect the biodiversity of the capital city.”
