Kim Jong-un “fully prepared” to lead
A senior North Korean party official, Yang Hyong-sop, has dismissed concerns over Kim Jong-un’s abilities as a leader. 
“We suffered the greatest loss in the history of our nation as a result of the sudden, unexpected and tragic loss of the Great Leader Kim Jong-il,” Yang said.
 “But still, we are not worried a bit because we know that we are being led by Comrade Kim Jong-un, who is fully prepared to carry on the heritage created by the Great General Kim Jong-il.”　
 Kim Jong-un’s quick ascension to power has raised questions amongst many about how ready he is to “inherit the rule over this nation of 24 million with a nuclear program as well as chronic trouble feeding … its people,” AP reports.
