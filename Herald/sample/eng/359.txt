Deadly Italian cruise ship disaster
An Italian cruise liner crashed into a rock and capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio on Jan. 13. 
According to news reports, the Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,200 people when it hit a rock off the coast of Giglio while making an unauthorized change from its programmed course. The change in course was apparently a favor to the chief waiter of the cruise liner, who is from the island. 
As of Jan. 17, 14 people are still reported missing since the accident and the shipâ€™s captain, Capt. Francesco Schettino, is facing charges of manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a shipwreck.
