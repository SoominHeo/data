Homeless World Cup
A South Korean team of eight homeless men will be joining other teams in Paris for the 2011 Homeless World Cup. An international competition that aims to empower and inspire the homeless, the Homeless World Cup this year will be held Aug. 21 to 28 at the Champs de Mars, Paris.
 The eight members of the South Korean team have been training hard since being selected during preliminary contests in May and July.
 The Homeless World Cup matches are played with four players per team on the court - three outfield players and one goalkeeper - and four substitute players. As an inclusive tournament, teams are expected to give each player an opportunity to play a reasonable amount of time each day. Each half is 7 minutes long, with a 1-minute interval between each half. 
According to the official Homeless World Cup website, a total of 64 national football teams will “unite for seven days of gritty, fast paced street soccer.” The goal of this tournament is to provide the homeless and socially marginalized participants the opportunity to change the course of their lives. It is to give them hope. 
According to the Homeless World Cup foundation, at least 70 percent of participants changed their lives by beating addictions, repairing broken relationships from the past and getting jobs, homes, training, and an education. Some have even gone on to become social entrepreneurs.
