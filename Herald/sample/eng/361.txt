 Korea to launch 2nd Antarctic research base
The Korean government announced that it would build a second research station in the Antarctic to get a better grasp of the polar region’s wildlife and resources.
 The new center called the Jang Bo-go base, named after a ninth-century admiral, will be located in Terra Nova Bay, the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs said. It is set for completion on March 2014.
 The King Sejong base, Seoul’s first research station, is located on King George Island and has been operating since 1988.
 But the “limited research capacity due to its geographical location” led the government to launch its second research base, Vice Minister Joo Sung-ho was quoted as saying. He insisted that the government will lead more active research following the completion of the Jang Bo-go base.
