Seoul to offer business-friendly environment to foreigners
Seoul seeks to provide a better business environment for foreign enterprises by reflecting their opinions in policymaking process, the Finance Minister said on Jan. 9.
 “We will actively reflect the opinions of the EU Chamber of Commerce, and make redoubled efforts to improve areas such as investor protection and property rights registration,” Bahk Jae-wan told at a meeting with European business people.
 To achieve its goal, the government will lower prices of rent and help foreign companies do business in better management and living conditions.
 Transforming South Korea to a “hub” in East Asia will require brisk participation of advanced EU service industries in the domestic market, Bahk commented.
