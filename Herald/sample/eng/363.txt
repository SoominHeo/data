Paralympic Games
The Paralympic Games is a major international multi-sport event for athletes with a physical disability. Sportsmen with physical disabilities, such as dwarfism, amputations, blindness and cerebral palsy, come together to compete in sports much like the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. In fact, there are Summer and Winter Paralympic Games, held immediately after their respective Olympic Games. 
Athletes that compete in the Paralympics should not be confused with those athletes who compete in the Special Olympics World Games, where athletes with intellectual disabilities can compete, or the Deaflympics, where deaf athletes come together to compete. 
The 1988 Summer Olympic Games held in Seoul was the first time the term “Paralympic” came into official use.
