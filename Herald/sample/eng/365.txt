Samsung to hire 26,000 people in 2012
Samsung Group said on Jan. 17 to hire 26,000 new employees and invest a record 47.8 trillion won in 2012.
 The announcement is noteworthy as it came amid the sluggish global economy with European countries suffering from unprecedented sovereign debt crisis.
 “The group decided to carry out record investments and hiring this year to secure new growth engines and contribute to the nation’s economic development in spite of the global economic downturn and uncertainty,” Samsung officials said.
 Samsung group’s chairman Lee Kun-hee stressed many times recently that his group will make greater investments, employ more people and nurture new growth engines. The firm also plans to gear efforts toward expanding exports.
 Samsung will reportedly recruit 9,000 college graduates, 5,000 experienced workers and 12,000 skilled workers that include 9,000 high school graduates.
 Samsung’s affiliated businesses include Samsung Electronics, Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Engineering, Samsung Life Insurance and many more. Samsung produces around a fifth of Korea’s total exports and the company’s revenues are larger than many countries’ GDP.
 Of the total investment (47.8 trillion won) in 2012, 31 trillion will be put into investing in facilities, while 13.6 trillion will be earmarked for research and development, Samsung officials said. The remaining 3.2 trillion won will be injected in capital investment.
 Meanwhile, Korea’s 30 largest business group promised on Jan. 13 to spend a combined 151.4 trillion won this year and hire 123,000 new workers, according to news reports.
 President Lee Myung-bak who finishes his tenure in February 2013 prioritizes job creation and the fight against inflation. Lee’s administration downgraded the nation’s economic growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012 due to the eurozone crisis and the slowdown in developed nations, AFP explained.
 Korea’s Finance Ministry expected Asia’s fourth-largest Korean economy to grow 3.8 per cent in 2011 and 3.7 per cent in 2012.
