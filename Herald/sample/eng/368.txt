Messi named FIFA World player of the Year for third straight time
“I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentine football and his name is Lionel Messi. Messi is a genius and he can become an even better player…I think he’s got everything it takes to become Argentina’s greatest player.” – Diego Maradona
 Lionel Messi, the brilliant Argentina and FC Barcelona forward, became the first player to win FIFA player of the year three times in a row. He received the FIFA Ballon d’Or award for 2011, beating his Barcelona teammate Xavi Hernandez and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo to garner football’s most prestigious individual honor. The only other three-time winners are Ronaldo of Brazil (1996-97, 2002) and Zinedine Zidane of France (1998, 2000, 2003). At 24, Lionel Messi is already considered one of the sport’s all-time greats, alongside football legends Pele, Diego Maradona and Alfredo di Stefano.
 Lionel Messi (born 24 June 1987) began playing football at a young age for Club Atlético Newell’s Old Boys -- a sports club based in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. His skill and potential soon caught the attention of La Liga powerhouse FC Barcelona. At age 13, he and his family moved to Europe where FC Barcelona offered treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. He played in Barcelona’s junior Infantil B and Cadete B & A teams from 2000 to 2003. Messi made his Spanish league debut for Barcelona in the 2004–05 season and broke the team record for the youngest footballer to score a league goal. He helped the team win the La Liga and the Champions League titles in his debut season. 
 Messi’s fast-paced, dynamic playing style, and his small stature (169cm) have drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona. He is a superb play-maker who can cut through defenses with deft dribbling and pinpoint passing. He is also a prolific scorer with an uncanny killer instinct and the ability to finish. Messi had a breakthrough season in the 2006–07 season, scoring 14 goals in 26 league games as a first team regular. He scored 38 goals in the 2008-2009 season and was instrumental in Barcelona’s treble-winning campaign (Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey). He scored 47 goals in the 2009-2010 season, and followed up with a record-breaking 55 goals in the 2010-2011 season. 
 Messi’s international career started in 2004 when he debuted for Argentina in an under-20 match against Paraguay. He was part of the team that won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in the Netherlands. At the 2006 World Cup, Messi became the youngest player to represent Argentina when he appeared as a substitute in the match against Serbia and Montenegro. He recorded a goal and an assist in his debut. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Messi scored in Argentina’s victories over Ivory Coast and the Netherlands. In the gold medal match, Messi assisted Di María for the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Nigeria. At the 2010 World Cup, Messi helped Argentina reach the quarterfinals before the team suffered a shocking 4-0 defeat against Germany. 
 Lionel Messi is one of the highest paid athletes in the world with annual income from salaries, bonuses and commercial endorsements exceeding $30 million. He established the Leo Messi Foundation -- a charity supporting access to education and health care for vulnerable children. In 2010, he was named a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. His activities, supported by FC Barcelona, are centered on supporting children’s rights all over the world.
