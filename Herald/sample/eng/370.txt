Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
SAD is described by the U.S. National Library of Medicine as “episodes of depression that occur at certain times of the year, usually during winter.” A lack of exposure to sunlight is considered a major cause for this change in mood, which is why people generally experience SAD during the winter rather than the summer.
