Two independent professionals promote Korea
Singer Kim Jang-hoon and Sungshin Women’s University professor Seo Kyoung-duk used ad space in the Wall Street Journal to request compensation from the Japanese government for former sex slaves, according to the Korea Herald.
Kim and Seo ran the ad headlined “Do You Hear?” in late December. It includes a photo of elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during World War II and a message asking for the Japanese government’s official apology for the abuses.
 The ad said that the elderly women had been holding weekly meetings in Seoul since 1992 and that the number of the attendants had grown to almost 1,000. 
 Kim, known as the “Dokdo guardian” and a generous giver in the nation supplied the fee for the ad, while Seo took charge of the details.
 Seo, who passes for a Korea PR expert, also bought a full page advertisement in the New York Times(NYT) in May 2009, requesting people around the world to stop referring to the East Sea as the Sea of Japan.
 In 2008, Seo spent a lot of money on full-page advertisements about Dokdo and the East Sea in the NYT and the Washington Post. In the ads, Seo stressed the historical aspect of the name of the sea lying between Korea and Japan by saying “The sea between Korea and Japan has been called the ‘East Sea’ by numerous countries for 2000 years.” The ads added that a set of islets called “Dokdo” in the East Sea, had also long been recognized as a Korean territory.
