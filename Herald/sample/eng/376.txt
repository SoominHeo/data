Political asylum granted to former intelligence agent
A U.S. court has granted political asylum to a former South Korean intelligence agent. 
 Former intelligence agent Kim Ki-sam allegedly applied for asylum in the U.S. in 2003, asking them not to send him back to the Koreas, where he might face either persecution or prosecution.
 Kim was the whistleblower who revealed that President Kim Dae-jungâ€™s government secretly paid money to North Korea in order to hold a historic inter-Korean summit.
 His grant was made by an appellate court in Philadelphia last month. Kim, 49, is now reported to live in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
