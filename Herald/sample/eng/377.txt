Customers’ phone numbers accidentally exposed
A glitch introduced during a routine maintenance operation on Jan. 10 has caused O2 smart phone users in the U.K. to unintentionally broadcast their personal cell phone numbers while browsing the Internet, AP reported. 
O2, a British telecommunications service provider, told reporters that the bug had been fixed by Jan. 25. However, Matt Bath, technology editor for the British consumer watchdog, “Which?”, has said that the damage had already been done. 
“This genie is completely out of the bottle,” Bath told AP. “Some unruly website may be rubbing their hands with glee at the data bounty that‘s landed on their laps.”
 Britain’s data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, is reported to be looking to the potential breach.
