The celebration of the Lunar New Year by thousands of Chinese citizens has caused 194 fires in Beijing, according to the state media. 
Traditionally, fireworks are set off during celebrations to ward off evil spirits, and such practice has led to injuries and fires every year. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that this year, 388 people were injured and 194 fires broke out during the first six days of the holiday. 
Xinhua also reported that this year, a force of 840,000 police and civilians was mobilized to help prevent firework-related disasters.
