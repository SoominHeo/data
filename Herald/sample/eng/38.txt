Korean economy’s light-speed development since liberation
The land of the morning calm celebrated its 66th anniversary of national liberation on Aug. 15, and its economy has grown at an unrivaled speed over the last 50 years.
 Korea was one of the poorest nations in the world when it was liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, but it has strengthened itself to become the world’s 13th largest economy.
 Right after the liberation, Korea had no industrial facilities left after the 1950-53 Korean War wrought havoc on its land.
 Korea’s per capita income in 1961 stood only at $82, making the country the 14th poorest nation in the world.
 However, following the national 5-year economic development plan from 1962, the national economy started to pick up; per capita income rose to $1,000 (1977), $5,000 (1989), $10,000 (1995) and $20,000 (2007)
 As for trade volume, Korea’s exports were tallied only at $3.5 million while its imports were around $50 million. But in 2011, the country’s aggregate trade volume was ranked the world’s 9th following the U.S., China, Germany, Japan, France, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Italy. Korea’s annual exports marked $466 billion, the highest amount so far.
 In particular, Korea has high industrial competitiveness in shipbuilding (world’s largest market share), semiconductors (second-largest), automobiles (fifth), steel-making (sixth) and other areas of parts and resources manufacturing.
 In terms of trade items in the 1940s, Korea’s exports were limited to cuttlefish and tungsten to Japan and China. Even by the 1960s, the exports were mainly iron ore, anthracite, cuttlefish and graphite.
 Running up to the 1970s, the exports widened to include textiles, plywood and shoes. In the 1980s, clothes, steel, vessels and TV sets were also included. And now, the country’s semiconductors, ships, cars and mobile phones are sweeping the global market with their reputation for quality.
