Giants of the past
The word “dinosaur” means “terrible lizard.” It is a name given to lizard-like animals that lived long, long ago. Many of the dinosaurs were the largest and scariest creatures that ever walked on land. All of them, large and small, were part of the animal group known as “reptiles.” 
The dinosaurs were the ancient cousins of today’s crocodiles, snakes, and lizards.
 You may be familiar with the brontosaur, or “thunder lizard.” What you may not know is that this dinosaur is now called apatosaur, meaning “dishonest lizard.” A mix-up in fossil bones gave scientists the wrong idea of what it looked like. The apatosaur was still pretty impressive: it was as much as 70 feet long. No matter what you call it, this creature certainly must have sounded like thunder when it walked.
 The apatosaur was a plant-eating dinosaur. Others, including the tyrannosaur, were carnivores, or meat-eaters. Tyrannosaurus rex was the “king of the lizards” and was as long as a fire engine. For many years the tyrannosaur was thought to be the largest carnivore ever to have walked on Earth. But the giganotosaur was an even larger carnivore!
 The anatosaur is called the “duck lizard” because it had a bill like a duck—though there were hundreds of un-duck-like teeth in its cheeks! The triceratops was the “three-horned lizard.” Many of these dinosaurs once lived in the western United States.
 There were many other kinds of dinosaurs—more than 1,000 different species. And they once lived almost everywhere in the world.
