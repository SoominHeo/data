Aurora paints night sky green
An aurora is a natural light display in the sky that appears in the high latitude regions, such as Arctic and Antarctic. It happens when a magnetic solar wind enters the Earth’s magnetic field and excites the electrons in oxygen and nitrogen molecules.
 Aurora can be classified into two different kinds: diffuse or discrete aurora. The diffuse aurora is a featureless glow in the sky which is invisible to the naked eye. On the contrary, the discrete aurora is only visible in the dark night sky.
 In particular, the phenomenon witnessed in northern latitudes is called the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The name came from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. Commonly seen in the Norwegian sky, the aurora borealis illuminates the northern horizon with a greenish or a faint red glow. 
 When aurora is witnessed in the southern sky - such as in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand and Australia - it gets a different name: aurora australis or the southern lights. 
 This wonder of nature, referred to as “Dance of the Spirits” in Europe and regarded as a sign of God during the Middle Ages, was very strongly seen on Jan. 24 in Scandinavia. The northern lights, created by a storm from the broiling sun dyed the northern Norway sky with phenomenal green color. It was also visible from northeast England and Ireland, which is very rare.
 Yet, scientists cautioned that these storms might cause trouble such as surges in power lines, and interference in radio and TV broadcasts and telephone signals.
