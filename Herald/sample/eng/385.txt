Kim Byung-hyun to pitch for Nexen Heroes
Former Major League Baseball (MLB) closer Kim Byung-hyun was recently introduced as the newest member of the Nexen Heroes in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO). Kim, a 2002 MLB All-Star, said he was looking forward to writing a new chapter in his career in his native land. Although he has previously represented Korea in international competitions, this will be his first stint in the KBO. Kim signed a one-year deal worth 500 million won ($436,870), with a club option for 100 million won. The team also gave him 1 billion won as a signing bonus. He will be wearing No. 49, the same number he wore when he was with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
 Kim Byung-hyun was a prominent player on the powerful Gwangju-Jeil High School baseball team that also included future stars Choi Hee-seop and Jae Seo. Kim was named both the most valuable player and the most valuable pitcher for the National High School Championships in 1996. He was selected to the Korean National Team in both 1997 and 1998. He demonstrated his skills in a pre-Olympic encounter against the U.S. Olympic squad in 1998 by striking out 15 batters in 6 2/3 innings. He also helped Korea claim the gold medal in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand. Kim briefly attended Sungkyunkwan University’s Faculty of Law until he was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 1999.
 Kim Byung-Hyun moved up through the Diamondbacks’ minor league system in quick and overpowering fashion. At the Double-A El Paso, he went 2–0 with 32 strikeouts in 21.1 innings. He was quickly promoted to the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinder, where he posted a 2-0 record with 21 strikeouts in 17.1 innings. His ability to strike out batters caught the attention of Diamondbacks coaching staff. At age 20, Kim made his Major League debut on May 29, 1999. In his first MLB outing, he was called on to pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning to preserve an 8-7 lead over the New York Mets. He responded by striking out star catcher Mike Piazza to earn his first save. 
 The 2001 season was a memorable one for Kim Byung-hyun. He made 78 appearances, recorded 19 saves, registered a 2.94 ERA, and fanned 113 batters in 98 innings. He made his first career postseason appearance in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 and got the save. In the National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves, Kim was spectacular: He earned two-inning saves on back-to-back days that clinched the Diamondbacks’ ticket to the World Series. However, Kim’s first trip to the World Series was disastrous. He gave up crucial late-inning homeruns in Game 4 and Game 5 that resulted in improbable come-back victories for the New York Yankees. Fortunately, the Diamondbacks went on to win the World Series in seven games, and Kim became the first Korean player to earn a World Series ring. 
 Kim Byung-hyun enjoyed his finest season as a Major League pitcher in 2002. He set a single-season franchise record for saves (36), breaking the old mark of 30 set in 1998. He made a team-high 72 appearances and finished the season with an 8-3 record, 92 strikeouts, and a career-best 2.04 ERA. He was selected for the 2002 All-Star Game. Kim was traded to the Boston Red Sox in 2003 where he served as part-time starter and closer. He was a member of Boston’s 2004 World Series-winning team but was absent from active roster due to injuries and ineffectiveness. He finished his MLB career in 2007 with the Florida Marlins.
