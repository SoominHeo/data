Girls’ Generation appears on popular U.S. talk shows
The popular K-Pop group, Girls’ Generation, has not only set records in Korea and Japan, but are now setting records on the other side of the world as well. According to SM Entertainment, the nine-member group will be the first Korean artists to appear on two of the most popular talk shows in the U.S. It is clear that success in Asia is not enough for these girls. 
Shortly after releasing their English album, “The Boys: Special Album," on iTunes and Amazon, the group was booked to appear on two of the highest rated talk show programs in the U.S. - “The Late Show with David Letterman” and “Live! With Kelly.” According to Interscope Records, the group’s label in the U.S., their latest English album includes remixes by Teddy Riley and Clinton Sparks as well as a feature performance by world-famous rapper, Snoop Dog. 
The popular group appeared on the popular late-night talk show, "The Late Show with David Letterman," as a musical guest to promote their latest album. They performed the English version of their latest hit, “The Boys,” in front of a live studio audience, which aired on Jan. 31. Following this performance, the nine-member group also appeared on the Feb. 1 morning talk show, “Live! With Kelly”, alongside Jennifer Lopez and guest co-host Howie Mandel. 
According to SM Entertainment, the group’s “global popularity and influence” is the reason for their appearances despite any prior promotions in the U.S. market. This suggests a rather favorable outcome if the group decides to enter the U.S. market in the future. 
It seems there is no stopping the Korean Wave.
