Stripped of knighthood
Former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland Fred Goodwin has had his knighthood stripped by Queen Elizabeth II recently over his role in the near collapse of the bank in 2008, AFP reported.
 “The Knighthood conferred upon Fred Goodwin as a Knight Bachelor has been canceled and annulled” read a statement by the Cabinet Office, saying that Goodwin brought the system into “disrepute.” 
Goodwin earned the nickname “Fred the Shred” and became the symbol of the financial crisis in Britain when he managed a “disastrous multi-billion-pound deal” at the height of the crisis in 2007. It cost thousands of jobs when RBS had to be bailed out by the government.
