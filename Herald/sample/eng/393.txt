Violence between football fans kills 74
A fight between supporters at an Egyptian football match led to the deaths of 74 people. 
The incident has caused fans and politicians to blame the ruling army for “failing to prevent the deadliest incident since Hosni Mubarak was ousted.” Reuters reported.
 At least 1,000 people were injured when supporters of the local team, al-Masry, staged a pitch invasion against fans of Egypt’s most successful club Al Ahli after winning the game on Feb. 1. 
Albadry Farghali, a member of parliament for Port Said, was quoted by Reuters as screaming in a telephone call during a live television broadcast, “The security forces did this or allowed it to happen. The men of Mubarak are still ruling. The head of the regime has fallen but all his men are still in their positions.”
