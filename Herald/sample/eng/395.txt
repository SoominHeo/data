Korean-language institute opens for Indonesian tribe
The first Korean-language institute was opened in an Indonesian tribe on Jan. 30, the Culture Ministry announced.　
 The Cia-Cia, a tribe of some 80,000 people in the city of Bau-Bau, in southeast Sulawesi, has adopted the Korean alphabet as its official writing system to preserve its fading spoken language. 
 South Korea’s Kyungpook National University in Daegu and Indonesia’s Muhammadiyah Buton University cooperated for the establishment.
 “We expect the local university’s operation of the King Sejong Institute in Bau-Bau with support from the South Korean government will help rejuvenate activities to promote Korean language in the country,” Bang Sun-gyu, director of culture policy division of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, said.
 Due to the increased popularity of Korean pop culture, 59 such institutes were already opened across the world with 30 more scheduled to be set up in 2012. The ministry said four will open in China and one in Taiwan, Thailand, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Algeria, Germany, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Peru and the United States.
