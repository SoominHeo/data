Anti-government protests in Syria
The massive protest in the country originally came as a response of uprisings in the neighboring countries of Tunisia and Egypt.
 Protesters have been asking for political reforms, the reinstatement of civil rights, and an end to the state of emergency which has been ongoing since 1963.
 Syria was under an Emergency Law from 1960 to 2011, and the law suspended constitutional protections for the citizens. Its government justified the state of emergency by pointing out that Syria was in a state of war with Israel.
 Syria has been controlled by the Baath Party, which blew severe attacks on the town of Hama to quell an uprising y the Sunni Muslim community. Tens of thousands of people were killed in the Hama massacre.
 Current Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded power from his father Hafez al-Assad, has been seeking a free market economy, which has led to reduction of state support for the poor, the erosion of support for basic goods and agriculture and unemployment rate among young people.
 Human rights in Syria under the Baath Party are largely criticized by global organizations. The Emergency Law has remained in effect since 1963, and gives security forces extensive powers of arrest and detention.
 The forces imprison human rights activists and other critics of the government.
 Rights of expression and association are strictly controlled by the authorities, and women and ethnic minorities face discrimination.
 According to Human Rights Watch in 2010, the Syrian President had failed to improve the country’s human rights record in the 10 years since he came to power. The group said Syria’s human rights conditions are among the worst in the world.
