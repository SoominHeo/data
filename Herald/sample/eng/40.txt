Daegu 2011
Official song: Let’s go together by Insooni and Huh Gak
 Official slogan: Sprint together for tomorrow
 Official mascot: Sarbi - the mascot’s name is derived from the sapsal gae, a dog breed indigenous to Daegu and its surrounding area. This breed is recognized as “Natural Monument No. 368” in Korea. The mascot symbolizes good fortune, while its warm and happy appearance represents a warm welcome from the host city.
 After about a year of deliberating, the IAAF Council announced on March 27, 2007 that the 13th World Athletics Championships would be held in Daegu. More than 3,500 athletes from 206 different nations have arrived in Daegu for what is considered the third biggest sporting event in the world. Scheduled to take place from Aug. 27 to Sept. 4, the athletes participating in the 2011 World Championships will compete for the gold in 47 different events (24 for men and 23 for women). 
On Aug. 26, a Welcome Night was scheduled to celebrate Daegu’s success in hosting the 2011 IAAF World Championships. It began at 7:30 p.m. at Duryu Park, and featured several traditional, classical and modern musical performances. Performances by K-pop artists, including Super Junior, Kara, BOA, Lena Park and others helped to fuel the excitement of the games. The event culminated in a fireworks display outside of Duryu Tower. 
Though the games started with a marathon in downtown Daegu at 9:00 a.m. on August 27, the opening ceremony did not take place until later in the evening at 6:30 p.m. It began with a performance by the official mascot “Sarbi” and ended with another fireworks display at Daegu Stadium. Musical performances included the official song by Insooni and Huh as well as a Dadeumi performance to show the contrast between the modern and traditional aspects of Korean culture.
