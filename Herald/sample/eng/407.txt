Continued violence in Syria
As the violence in Syria continues, the Arab League abandoned its peacekeeping mission to Syria on Feb. 12. It is now calling on the U.N. Security Council to send a joint U.N.-Arab team to help diffuse the situation as Syrian armed forces resume their attack on the city of Homs. 
The assault on Homs by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government has drawn criticism from the beginning by neighboring Arab nations. Reuters reports that the uprising in Syria has become one of the “bloodiest of the Arab Spring revolts sweeping the region since the end of 2010.” 
As of Feb. 13, the U.N. estimates that more than 5,400 people have been killed since the Syrian uprising began in March last year.
