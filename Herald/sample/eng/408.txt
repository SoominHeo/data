Europe: A frozen continent
As temperatures drop to nearly minus 40°C in parts of Europe, rivers, lakes and even seas have frozen over, causing disruptions in travel as well as rising death tolls. 
This winter, the continent of Europe has seen some of the lowest temperatures in decades. As of Feb. 15, news reports put the death toll at more than 500, with no end to the bitter cold in sight. 
Italy, for instance, has experienced major problems due to the severe winter weather. Hit by the worst snowstorm since the 1980s on Feb. 3, the freezing temperatures has wrought havoc on many aspects of the nation’s economy, including agriculture, transportation and tourism.
