Penalties get tougher for illegal sports betting
The government announced its plan to intensify penalties on illegal sports match-fixing, after yet another sports scandal emerged in nation’s volleyball league, following a similar outrage in Korea’s professional soccer league last year.
 The Daegu District Prosecutors’ Office stated on Feb. 8 that five former and current pro league volleyball players were arrested for illegal match rigging to make unfair profit. 
 A 30-year-old former player surnamed Yum was his team’s libero until he retired from his team KEPCO45 in July last year. He has been under close scrutiny for making intentional errors and led his team’s defeat in a Feb. 2010 match, according to a previous plan with a gambling broker surnamed Kang. The other two players also allegedly took part in at least four cases of volleyball match-rigging, prosecutors said. 
The revised sports promotion law will punish those who take part in match-fixing schemes or operate illegal betting websites. They will be subjected to up to seven years in jail or get a maximum fine of 70 million won ($62,570). At the moment, the law only allows for a maximum fine of 20 million won. Whistle-blowers of illegal activities, on the other hand, will be rewarded, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said.
 The rigorous penalties show the government’s firm determination to root out illegal sports gambling, Ministry officials.
 Controversy over illegal sports betting first surfaced last year, as some former and current K-League players were reported to have been deeply involved in a massive match-fixing scandal. Players implicated in the nation’s first ever sports scandal received prison terms and fines. They were also permanently banned from playing their sports. 
 Last year, the V-League, with seven men’s teams and six women’s clubs, enjoyed unprecedented popularity in Korea.
