Language institute leaks TOEIC, TEPS questions
A local English education institution famous for its knowhow of various English tests, has been charged with a violation of copyright law. 
 Prosecutors said the Hackers Group had leaked questions from the TOEIC (the Test of English for International Communication) and TEPS (the Test of English Proficiency developed by Seoul National University) for the institute’s own profit. 
 The notorious institution recorded and videotaped written and spoken questions using specially-manufactured tiny audio and video recorders at least 106 times.
 Prosecutors confirmed the stolen questions were immediately forwarded and uploaded to the company’s website, along with the answers, drawing throngs of exam takers.
 The company’s profit was reported to have reached more than 100 billion won ($89.1 million) in 2010.
