N.K. restaurant opens in Netherlands
A North Korean restaurant has opened in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam as the country seeks to raise money and build bridges with Europe.
 The “Pyongyang Restaurant” was launched in January in a joint venture between North Korea and two Dutch businessmen, according to South Korean reports. It is the first North Korean restaurant opened in Europe.
 “North Korea has sought to normalize relations with Europe since 2000,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korea Studies in Seoul. “The opening of North Korea’s first restaurant in Europe can be seen as the North’s attempt to improve ties with the West.”
 The restaurant is staffed by nine North Koreans, seats 24 people and has walls covered with pictures of North Korean scenery. The main item on the menu is a nine-course meal priced at 79 euros ($104).
