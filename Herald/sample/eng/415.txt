Eco-friendly gadget ready for buses in Seoul
All Seoul city buses will get anti-pollution device as part of an effort to cut emissions and fuel costs, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government
 The energy saving device makes a beeping sound when drivers make a quick start or sudden push on the brakes. It also automatically cuts off the engine of idling vehicles in order to save energy.
 The municipal government pointed out that there were a total of 8,900 buses in Seoul and the device would be attached to all buses by 2014. So far around 30 percent or 2,708 buses have the gadget under the government’s pilot project that was launched in 2009. 
 Under the new program, fuel costs are forecast to be reduced by 10 percent, saving nearly 26 billion won ($23.2 million) per year.
 “Our pilot project showed that an average of 13 percent of fuel costs per vehicle was saved thanks to the gadget,” said Jeong Heung-soon, the director of the city’s eco-friendly transportation department. 
 “Attaching the gadget to buses aims to save energy and reduce greenhouse gases, which will ultimately boost public safety.”
 The program also comes with education on environmentally-friendly driving and incentives for bus drivers if they meet their energy reduction targets.
