A mystery disappearance
Many of the dinosaurs that once roamed the Earth were so big and strong that they didn’t need to be afraid of any living thing. So why aren’t there dinosaurs today?
 Some scientists think that when new kinds of plants began to grow on Earth, dinosaurs couldn’t eat them. New kinds of animals smaller than dinosaurs also appeared during this time. They may have been able to survive better than the dinosaurs.
 It’s also possible that a disease killed dinosaurs by the millions. Not all scientists think that all dinosaurs died at once. Another explanation is that a changing climate killed them. We know that when they were living, the weather began to change. Summers grew shorter and winters grew colder. In some places heat waves dried up rivers and swamps. Elsewhere, new lakes and rivers appeared, and many places were flooded. Some dinosaurs may have died because it gradually became too cold or too hot for them. 
 Many scientists believe that dinosaurs died because an asteroid struck the Earth about 65 million years ago. The dust raised by the impact would have blocked out sunlight for months, so that plants stopped growing and the temperature dropped. When plant-eating dinosaurs died from lack of food, so would the meat eaters that hunted them. 
 Some scientists think that many dinosaurs evolved into birds. So the next time you see a robin, consider that you may be looking at a dinosaur’s relative.
