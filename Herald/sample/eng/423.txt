Deadly prison fire in Honduras kills 359
A deadly fire started in an overcrowded prison in Honduras by an inmate on Feb. 14 led to the deaths of 358 inmates and one female overnight visitor, Reuters reported. 
“We couldn‘t get them [the prisoners] out because we didn’t have the keys and couldn‘t find the guards who had them,” Comayagua fire department spokesman Josue Garcia said. It is alleged that willful negligence contributed to the high death toll. 
“We see that there was negligence in not opening the [cell] gates. There needs to be an exhaustive investigation undertaken,” Andrés Pavón, president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) said according to Honduras Weekly. “The keys [to the cells] are nowhere to be found.”
