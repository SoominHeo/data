Next Chinese leader returns to Muscatine, Iowa
Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping arrived in the U.S. on Feb. 15 as part of his transition into presidency and in an effort to ease tensions between two of the world’s most powerful nations.
 Xi, expected to become China’s president next year, kicked off his U.S. tour in the small Midwestern town of Muscatine, Iowa; a town he had visited more than two decades ago. 
i visited Muscatine as a lowly provincial official in 1985 as part of a tour to observe American agricultural practices. 
U.S. officials expressed their hopes that in light of his recent visit and familiarity with U.S. culture, “Xi’s ascension might result at least in a more candid and productive rapport,” the Washington Post reported.
