Korean movies about social issues fly high
Korean movies reflecting social issues have been attracting record numbers of viewers at the box office, heralding a boom in Korean movies for the year. 
 The latest local hit movie is “Dancing Queen,” a Korean comedy about a middle-aged married couple. In the film, the couple searches for their lost dreams. The main male character, starred by Hwang Jung-min runs for Mayor of Seoul. Until then he has led a mundane life. His wife, played by actress Um Jung-wha, also follows her childhood dream of becoming a pop singer.
 The movie touches upon major social issues, such as free school meals, which was a major political issue at the Seoul Metropolitan Government last year and the government’s measures to boost the country’s plunging birth rate. 
 Data by the Korean Film Council showed that more than 3.35 million movie-goers watched it over the past month. 
 Another South Korean film, “Unbowed,” a low-budget courtroom drama based on a true story has also exceeded 3 million viewers in less than a month of its release. 
 The film, whose Korean name translates directly as “Broken Arrows,” reveals a true story of a college mathematics professor Kim Myeong-ho, who got expelled from the school after he raised problems with the school’s entrance exam.
 Kim fought against the college but was unable to acquire reinstatement and had to serve four years in prison until early last year. He was accused of attacking the judge with his crossbow, demanding a fair sentence, while undergoing a series of court ordeals. 
 The reality based film prompted intense public attention to the case; similar to the effect “Dogani” had over the sexual abuse of disabled children last September. 
 Thanks to the success of “Unbowed,” Korea’s biased judicial system has resurfaced as a major social issue.
