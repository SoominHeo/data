Seoul proposes family reunions to NK
South Korea made a proposal to North Korea for a Red Cross meeting to resume reunions of members of separated families in both Koreas. 
 South Koreaâ€˜s Red Cross chief Yu Jung-keun sent a message to her North Korean counterpart on Feb.14 at the border village of Panmunjeom, according to the South Korean government.
 Two Koreas have held more than a dozen reunions so far since a landmark Inter-Korean summit in 2000. This brought together more than 21,700 family members from the both sides of the peninsula. 
 Reunions have been halted since October 2010 when the North carried out two attacks on South Korea.
