World Athletics Championships
Organized by the IAAF, the first World Athletics Championships took place in 1983 at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. 
The IAAF set out to hold a regular world championship event in the late 1960s, when its membersâ€™ desire to have their own world championship for athletics events began to grow. Prior to this, the IAAF had been content with allowing the Olympic Games to be the main avenue for competition in organized athletics. In 1976, a World Athletics Championships separate from the Olympic Games was approved by the IAAF during a council meeting in Puerto Rico. 
Much like the Olympic Games, the World Championships was to be held once every four years, but it was changed in 1991 to be a biennial event.
 In 1983 an estimated 1,300 athletes from 154 countries participated, and by 2003 it had grown to 1,907 athletes from 203 countries. For the 2011 World Championships, an estimated 3,500 athletes from 206 countries will be participating.
