Major conglomerates see profits decline in 2011
Major Korean conglomerates are known to have fought with bad economic conditions in 2011 and LG Group suffered the most in terms of combined earnings, according to statistics released on Feb. 19.
 Based on the data of the Financial Supervisory Service and others, LG Group’s nine subsidiaries posted a combined net profit of 2.7 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in 2011, down 64.2 percent from a year earlier. Their operating profit also fell 40.1 percent to 4.5 trillion won. 
LG’s flagship unit, LG Electronics, posted a net loss of 432 billion in 2011. Other affiliates such as LG Display and LG Innotek struggled with net losses. Only LG Household & Healthcare bucked the trend with increased profit of 271 billion won.
 LG is largely expected to stage a recovery in 2012, due to improving market position in key product categories, according to experts.
 Hanjin Group, which runs Korean Air and Hanjin Shipping, posted a net loss of 922.1 billion won last year, compared with a profit of 771.1 billion won in 2010. 
Hyundai Motor Group, which has eight listed units, posted a net profit of 16.9 trillion won last year, up 9.5 percent from 2010, a solid performance that brought it closer to Samsung Group. 
Samsung’s 12 affiliates saw their 2011 net profit decline 17.8 percent to 17.3 trillion won. The net income gap between Samsung and Hyundai shrank dramatically to 384.6 billion won last year, down from 5.6 trillion won in 2010, 
As far as operating profit was concerned, Hyundai’s income grew 3.8 percent to 17.5 trillion won in 2011, while Samsung’s went down 9.9 percent to 20.5 trillion won. 
Fueled by the higher earnings, Hyundai Motor Group’s market capitalization sprinted 16 percent to 127 trillion won, marking the highest growth among the top 10 conglomerates. Analysts said Hyundai benefited from strong overseas demand last year as the earthquake badly affected the manufacturing and distribution channels of Japanese carmakers already hit by the rising value of the yen against the greenback. 
While POSCO Group saw its operating profit and net income down 1.7 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, SK Group managed to post 14 trillion won in operating profit, up 45.5 percent from a year earlier. 
Stronger sales in the automotive, chemical and refinery fields helped Hyundai and SK groups, while other conglomerates rushed to handle a slew of negative developments such as greater concerns about the global economic slowdown and the eurozone debt woes.
