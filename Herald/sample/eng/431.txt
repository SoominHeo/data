Swiss ready launch first space cleaner
Swiss scientists announced on Feb.15 that they plan to develop a machine that acts almost like a vacuum cleaner in the outer space, scooping up thousands of abandoned satellite and rocket parts.
 The announcement of the launch of CleanSpace as the first satellite designed to clean up space debris, came from the Swiss Space Center at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), a top science university, reported AP News.
 “It has become essential to be aware of the existence of this debris and the risks that are run by its proliferation,” said Claude Nicollier, an astronaut and EPFL professor.
 According to EPFL, there are “16,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in diameter and hundreds of millions of smaller particles,” and they are “ripping around the earth at speeds of several kilometers per second.”
 The report explains that CleanSpace One satellite chases its target (debris), unfolds its bio-inspired gripping mechanism just before reaching its target, and firmly attached to the debris, powers on its engines in order to pushing it to the Earth atmosphere, where debris will be burnt up during the descent. 
 The center spokesman Jerome Grosse points out that there are two ways to get the debris out of outer space. One is used by CleanSpace One satellite, which scoops up debris and then burns it up in Earth’s atmosphere and the other one is a satellite that collects debris and ejects them into the atmosphere while it remains in space.
 The Swiss Space Centre director Volker Gass stated that the goal is to provide sustainably designed, ready-made systems for clearing up space debris, with added hopes that his team would becoming “pioneers in this area.”
 According to a 2011 study by Swiss Re insurance company, every year there is almost a one in 10,000 chance that an orbiting satellite measuring 10 square meters will bump into a piece of space debris larger than one centimeter.
