Violence in Syria escalates; two Western journalists are killed
As the violence in Syria continues to escalate under President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, journalists from the U.S. and France have been included in the ever-growing list of victims. 
The deaths of Marie Colvin, an American journalist for the British Sunday Times, and Remi Ochlik, a freelance photographer who recently won a 2012 World Press Photo prize for a photo taken during the Libyan revolution, were confirmed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Feb. 22. 
Fellow journalists expressed grief over the incident. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was quoted by CBS News as saying: “This tragic incident is another example of the shameless brutality of the Assad regime.” 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed a more emotional reaction, stating, “That’s enough now, the regime must go.”
