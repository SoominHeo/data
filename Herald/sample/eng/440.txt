Somber mood as Tibetans celebrate Losar
The Tibetan community all over the world gathered to celebrate Losar, the Tibetan New Year, on Feb. 22. Celebrations were subdued, however, in light of the recent string of self-immolations and protests against Chinese control.
 Traditionally, Losar is a combined celebration of Buddhist rituals and family celebrations usually observed across the currently-occupied Tibetan highlands of western China. This year’s celebrations have been overshadowed by the growing protest against the Chinese occupation. 
The exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, has blamed the recent protests and self-immolations on "cultural genocide" by the Chinese, denying “Chinese accusations that he incites violence and wants full-fledged independence,” according to Reuters.
