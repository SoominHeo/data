S. Korea calls on China to free N. Korean Defectors
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry urged China on Feb. 21 to abide by “international norms” regarding North Korean defectors. 
 “Unless they [the North Korean defectors] have committed a crime, it is right for the Chinese government to handle them in line with international norms,” President Lee Myung-bak remarked. It came a day after the administration’s announcement that it would raise the issue with the U.N.
 Recent media reports said that nine North Korean escapees had been forcibly transferred to the border city of Tumen. Chinese authorities confirmed that they had arrested 30 North Koreans and that they were in the process of repatriation. China’s stance on the matter has been consistent over the years, calling North Korean defectors “illegal economic migrants who must be returned home.” With no exception, China has sent back those arrested within its borders.
 The public’s attention on the issue has seen a surprising surge as throngs of local human rights groups and celebrities such as Cha In-pyo participated in protests appealing for humanitarian release of the refugees. According to Yonhap News, an opposition lawmaker went on a hunger strike outside the Chinese Embassy in Seoul and one activist group launched a global movement through social network services and e-mail to stop China’s merciless and inhumane treatment of North Korean defectors. 
 The North’s new leadership has toughened punishment of the country’s fugitives as Kim Jung-un, the North’s new leader, seeks to assert his control over the fragile regime. North Korean defectors residing in the South verified that should the defectors return home, they would face severe punishment across three generations of their families, including imprisonment in re-education camps where they face forced labor, corporal punishment and other human rights abuses. 
 More than 20,000 North Koreans have fled to the South since the 1950s; most of them escaped via China.
