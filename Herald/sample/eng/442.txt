Scientists find anti-cancer agent
Korean scientists have discovered a new anti-cancer agent that might open a new road to a safer cancer treatment, the Science Ministry said.
 A team led by professor Kim Sung-hoon of Seoul National University found that an injection of refined and amplified dose of GRS gradually killed cancer cells in mice.
 Kim stated the discovery suggests “a new discovery of the immune system which may possibly treat cancer free of adverse reactions from drugs.”
 The ministry noted that the anti-cancer agent, Glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is an enzyme that exists in human bodies.
