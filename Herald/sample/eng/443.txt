Watch out for illegal SNS campaign activity
As the South Koreaâ€™s general elections near, the police are poised to gear up their crackdowns on illegal political activities using social networking services, says Yonhap News.
 The report noted that organizations or individuals wanting to conduct polls through SNS are obliged to notify the National Election Commission two days in advance. Polls that have not been verified or registered with the National Election Commission are considered illegal and will be subjected to punishment. 
 The report added that distribution of false information, provision of cyber money, and illegal campaign activities will also be punished.
