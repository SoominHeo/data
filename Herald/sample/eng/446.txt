300 million-year-old-forest found in China
Researchers have unearthed a forest in northern China which has been preserved under a layer of ash for 300 million years, AP said.
 Located west of the Inner Mongolian district of Wuda, the forest has remained so intact that it was likened by the scientists to the “Italian city of Pompeii.”
 “It’s marvelously preserved,” study co-author Hermann Pfefferkorn of the University of Pennsylvania said. “It’s like Pompeii.”
 “Pompeii gives us deep insight into Roman culture, but it doesn’t say anything about Roman history,” he added. “On the other hand, it elucidates the time before and the time after. This finding is similar. It’s a time capsule and therefore it allows us now to interpret what happened before or after the incident much better.”
 The excavation of nearly 1,000 square meters of the area showed that the ash fell on trees and plants in just a few days during the explosion, making the plants’ pristine preservation possible.
 Scientists also discovered six groups of trees, ranging from low-lying tree ferns to now-extinct trees, such as Sigillaria, Cordaites and Noeggerathiales. Based on the findings, AP said, the team worked with a painter to depict the forest’s original appearance.
