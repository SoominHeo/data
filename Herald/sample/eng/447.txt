The Tyrant King
It was longer than a bus, weighed more than four tons, and had teeth up to a foot long. The tyrannosaur may have died out 65 million years ago, but it is still one of the largest meat-eating land animals that ever lived. It’s no wonder that the first scientist who discovered this frightening creature’s bones called it Tyrannosaurus rex: “tyrant lizard king.” 
 Dinosaurs were not true lizards. When scientists first discovered tyrannosaur fossils, however, they did believe that such a dangerous-looking animal would have been a powerful and mean bully among the dinosaurs. The tyrannosaur’s jagged teeth and huge jaws make it clear that the tyrannosaur was a powerful carnivore, or meat eater.
 Tyrannosaurs lived mainly in what is now North America and Asia. The creature was about 40 feet long from its head to its thick and heavy tail. The tyrannosaur probably stooped forward, with the big tail balancing its weight when it walked. The tyrannosaur had large, powerful rear legs but small front arms.
 These forearms wouldn’t even have been able to reach its mouth. So the tyrannosaur probably planted its clawed rear feet on a dead animal, bit hard, and ripped the flesh away from the carcass. The tyrannosaur is one of the most popular of all dinosaurs, thanks to movies and books. But scientists still don’t know a lot about the beast. Did it hunt by sight or by smell? Was tyrannosaur a hunter at all, or did it just eat dead animals it found? Was it a fast runner? With so many questions, we’re still getting to know the tyrannosaur- but from a safe distance!
