 Interpol arrests suspected members of Anonymous
The international police agency Interpol said in a statement released on Feb. 28 that 25 suspected members of the hacker group Anonymous had been arrested. 
Acting Interpol executive director of police services Bernd Rossbach said in a statement, “This operation shows that crime in the virtual world does have real consequences for those involved, and that the Internet cannot be seen as a safe haven for criminal activity, no matter where it originates or where it is targeted.”
 The suspects, aged between 17 and 40, were arrested in a global sweep of suspected Anonymous hackers. Specifically, they are suspected of planning coordinated cyber-attacks against government and business websites around the world.
