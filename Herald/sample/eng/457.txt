Greece approves more austerity measures
Greeceâ€™s Parliament approved new cuts in public sector pensions and government spending on Feb. 28, in an effort to secure their second bailout in less than two years, AP reported. 
The most recent cuts will help save the government a total of 3.2 billion euros ($4.31 billion) and is necessary for receiving a new 130 billion euro rescue package from other eurozone countries and the IMF. 
Unfortunately, more than two years of harsh austerity measures since the collapse of its economy has taken a heavy toll on the recession-bound nation. Greece has seen thousands of businesses close, and unemployment has climbed to a record high of 21 percent.
