Nuclear security summit to be held next month
World leaders from 53 nations will meet in South Korea from March 26 to 27 to seek a safer world without nuclear terrorism and lay the “building blocks” of a global governance to carry out that agenda. 
 Attendees of the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit include U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
 “When we develop a working institution to deal with the nuclear security issue, then, we will make another very important achievement which is the development of building blocks for global governance,” First Vice Foreign Minister Ahn Ho-young said.
 The key topics at the summit would be how to protect the world from the threat of nuclear terrorism and ensure the safety of atomic energy.
 Since last year’s nuclear disaster in Japan, the safety of atomic energy has been a main focus of the global community.
