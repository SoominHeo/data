Universities slash fees by 4.5 percent
The tuition fees of domestic Universities have been cut by 4.5 percent on average this year, the Education Ministry said.
 The ministry stated that average tuition fees at the 186 universities in South Korea are 6.7 million won, down 4.48 percent compared to last year. Students have repeatedly called for tuition costs to be slashed. 
 It is the first tuition reduction since 1948.
 Around 80 percent of higher education institutions in South Korea are operated by private foundations, which rely heavily on tuition fees for revenue.
 According to Yonhap News, the government set aside 1.75 trillion won for this year’s tuition support to lighten students’ financial burdens.
