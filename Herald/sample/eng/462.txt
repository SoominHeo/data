KORUS FTA goes into effect
The free trade agreement between Korea and the U.S. takes effect tomorrow (Mar. 15), five years and nine months after the first negotiation between the two parties started in 2006.
 The Korean government says the bilateral deal means the country now has free trade deals with more than 60 percent of the world economy.
 The so-called KORUS FTA is also expected to foster other bilateral relationships between the two nations including that in the field of security, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Feb. 22.
 Korean businesses hailed the launch of the new trade deal, saying that lower tariffs and transaction costs would make it much easier to penetrate into the U.S. market.
 In particular, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “The introduction of the KORUS FTA will eliminate the U.S. tariffs levied on Korean automobiles within four years, and will help the Korean industry dominate the U.S. automobile market, which is 10 times as large as that of Korea.”
 Meanwhile, Korean retailers said they planned to import more food products upon the launch of the KORUS FTA, according to a poll of 250 local retailers, conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
 The poll revealed that about 30 percent of respondents plan to import more processed foods and that as many respondents are considering importing more fresh farm produce.
 The poll also showed that 18.6 percent of domestic retailers wanted to import more cosmetics, medicine and liquor.
 The results of the poll suggested that 59.8 percent of the retailers expected the full impact of the KORUS FTA to be felt a year after it is implemented.
 Local retailers, meanwhile, called on the government to provide more detailed FTA customs rules, overseas market conditions and training to better utilize the open trade arrangement with the world’s largest economy.
