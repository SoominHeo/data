Bird flu outbreak blocks poultry imports from Taiwan
South Korea banned imports of all poultry products from Taiwan, following the island nationâ€™s announcement of an avian influenza (AI) outbreak in early March.
 Poultry products made since Dec. 7 have all been banned, said the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as the kind of flu strain (H5N2) reported is believed to have a maximum incubation period of three weeks. Fortunately, the ministry added, humans are not vulnerable to the virus.
