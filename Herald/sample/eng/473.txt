Composer of 'Supercalifragilisticexplialidocious' dies at 86
The songwriter behind many memorable childhood songs, Robert Sherman, died in London at age 86 on March 5, AP reported. 
Sherman’s legacy of work can be described as “both complex and instantly memorable,” including the “Supercalifragilisticexplialidocious” song sung by the magical nanny Mary Poppins from Disney’s 1964 film adaptation of the series of children’s books by the same name. 
Robert Sherman and his brother Richard composed scores for films including, “The Jungle Book,” “The Aristocrats,” “Mary Poppins,” “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” and the famous theme park song, “It’s a Small World (After All)”.
 Sherman is survived by his brother and four children: Laurie, Jeffrey, Andrea and Robert.
