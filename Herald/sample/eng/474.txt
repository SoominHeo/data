 Iraqi women demand changes in “honor killings’ laws
The practice of “honor killings” was brought to light once again when a father from the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk drenched his three teenage daughters with boiling water and shot them because he suspected they were dishonoring him, Reuters reported. 
Though two of the three daughters died, the father was handed a light sentence of only two years. Although murder carries a death sentence in Iraq, certain laws allow for lenient sentences for such “honor killings.” 
Paradoxically, a 12-year-old Iraqi girl who killed her father after catching him committing adultery was sentenced to 15 years in jail. 
Women activists, led by the only woman in Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki’s cabinet, Minister of State for Women’s Affairs Ibtihal al-Zaidi, have called for a change in the controversial law.
