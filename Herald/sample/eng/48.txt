Hedgehogs, attractive animals
When we think of hedgehogs, we usually only think of their thorns. People are scared of them. Nobody really knows their lovable side. However, hedgehogs are really attractive animals. I can tell because I have 3 hedgehogs at home.
 I have had them for about 4 years. At first, I didn‘t actually want them. I wanted a dog. But after a while with the hedgehogs, I started to like them. They are part of my family and I really care for them. 
First, a hedgehog follows only one person. They are not like dogs. They are not kind to all people. When somebody gets close to them, they think that the person is dangerous. But a hedgehog is very kind to one person. The person who gives them food is very kind to them. They remember their master’s scent. They don‘t try to attack their masters. So only the master can touch his hedgehog easily.
 Second, hedgehogs don’t need much space to feed. Hedgehogs are small, so they only need a cage. Some people make a hedgehogs’ room, but they don’t need that much space to live. Because they live in a cage, they can’t make a mess. Also, it is easy to clean their cage and it doesn’t take much time. The hard part is it is finding them when they escape! 
Third, it is fun to play with hedgehogs after getting close with them. When a person keeps training them, hedgehogs don’t think of that person as an enemy. So they relax when they are with that person. They sometimes sleep on the person’s lap, and sometimes chase him. Most people think that we can‘t play with hedgehogs. But actually it is very fun playing with them. When we think of hedgehogs as our friends, they think so and when we think them as our enemies, they think so.
 Hedgehogs are not scary animals at all. They are very cute and friendly pets. Nowadays, hedgehogs are not rare pets. A lot people keep them. you can even buy hedgehogs’ food or shampoo. And I think that’s good. I want many people to know about hedgehogs and like them and care about them.
