Prince Harry lashes out at war-zone critics
In a recent interview with CBS News, Prince Harry denounced critics who claim he will never return to the front line, despite having recently qualified as an Apache helicopter pilot. 
“These people live in a ridiculous world to even think that,” the 27-year-old prince said of the critics. “For me personally, as I said, I want to serve my country. I‘ve done it once, and I’m still in the Army, I feel as though I should get the opportunity to do it again.“
 Harry served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2008, but his tour was cut short when the media blackout on reporting about his services was violated by foreign websites.
