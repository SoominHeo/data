Obama expected to visit DMZ
The U.S. President Barack Obama will visit the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), when he travels to South Korea for the second Nuclear Security Summit on March 26-27, the White House said.
 “A visit to the DMZ would be reflective of the president‘s commitment to both security on the Korean Peninsula and the need for North Korea to live up to its international obligations, give up its nuclear weapons program and return to the community of nations,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney mentioned.
 It will be Obama’s third visit to South Korea since his rise to power in 2009. Previous U.S. presidents who visited the DMZ, the border area between the two Koreas, include Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush
