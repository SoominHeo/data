Korea to first clone extinct mammoth
A private bioengineering laboratory led by disgraced stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-suk announced on March 13 that it had decided to work with a Russian university in cloning an extinct mammoth.
 The project would be the first to clone extinct animal, and thus would open new possibilities for the preservation of extinct species, the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation noted.
 According to the foundation, tissue samples of a mammoth that dates back as far as 4,500 years are to be implanted to an elephantâ€™s womb for 22 months.
 Hwang, a former veterinary professor of Seoul National University, is reportedly taking part in the experiment. Last year, he succeeded in cloning several endangered dogs.
