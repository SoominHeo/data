E-learning industry poised to expand
Korea’s online-learning market witnessed robust growth, with sales increasing 9.2 percent from the previous year to 2.4 trillion won ($2.2 billion), according to the Ministry of Knowledge Economy.
 The ministry revealed the results of its “E-learning Status Survey for 2011,” and explained that more than half of the total population aged over 3 had experienced e-learning in 2011.
 Specifically, 52.8 percent of the population is said to have experienced e-learning. The figure stood at 48.3 percent in 2009, growing to 49 percent in 2010.
 By age group, teenagers’ use of e-learning was the highest (74.5 percent), while those in their 50s also rose sharply by 3.8 percentage points from the previous year. E-learning use of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s tallied at 67.9 percent, 44.9 percent and 41.6 percent in that order.
 The number of e-learning service providers rose 6.9 percent in 2011 on-year to 1,656, and employment by the service providers grew 7.3 percent to 25,182 in 2011. Online service management staff accounted for 27 percent of the total workforce, followed by content developers (23 percent) and system operators (20 percent).
 Asked their reasons for using e-learning, 39.5 percent said they use it to study foreign languages, followed by extended schooling (33.1 percent), preparation for qualifying exams (20.7 percent), and deepening knowledge on work duties (18.1 percent).
 Of the respondents with experience in e-learning, 18 percent said they studied with mobile gadgets such as smartphones and tablet PCs. Experts say that the trend will accelerate smart learning further when supported by relevant content development and government support.
 The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said it would build a smart-learning support center to promote e-learning content and develop relevant new technologies.
