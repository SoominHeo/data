U.N. unites against Syria
As the violence continues and begins to spill across borders, all 15 members of the U.N. Security Council came together on Mar. 21 to support efforts by Kofi Annan to end the violent conflict in Syria. 
According to Reuters, the statement from the U.N. Security Council “threatened Syria with unspecified ‘further steps’ if it failed to comply with Annan’s peace plan, which calls for a cease-fire and demands swift access for aid agencies.” It was a rare moment of global unity that “dealt a serious diplomatic blow” to the Syrian President. 
The popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began more than a year ago, causing thousands of deaths with no end in sight.
