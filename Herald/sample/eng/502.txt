Philippines acquires U.S. smart bomb technology
Senior security officials in the Philippines recently confirmed to AFP the use of high-tech weaponry in the continued fight against the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. 
The technology of satellite-guided bombs and drone surveillance has been supplied by the U.S. since shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. The U.S. has been assisting the Philippines by providing advice, training and intelligence in the fight to keep the terrorists at bay. According to AFP, however, “the smart bombs are the first major high-tech hardware supplied to the Philippines.” 
The goal of adapting such high-tech techniques comes from the “change in recent years from massive offensives to surgical, intelligence-driven strikes that target holdouts of the battered Abu Sayyaf,” AFP reported.
