Seoul turns waste into fuel worth 185 bln won
The Seoul city government produced 185 billion won ($165 million) worth of energy using household waste, reports Yonhap News.
 According to the report, about 730,000 tons of combustible household waste was recycled last year and produced fuel energy well enough to heat 190,000 households in the city area.
 “In order to save energy and the environment through heat produced from waste, we need citizens to actively cooperate in separating recyclable waste,” a city official urged.
 South Korea is the world’s fifth-largest crude oil buyer and depends entirely on imports for its oil use.
