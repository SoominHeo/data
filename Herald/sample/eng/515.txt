Antique Japanese maps show Dokdo as Korea’s
A South Korean institute revealed three ancient Japanese maps which showed Dokdo as Korean territory, giving more strength to Korea’s claim over the islets, Yonhap News reported.
 During the press conference by the Northeast Asian History Foundation, one 1892 map differentiated Japan from Dokdo by color, and another map from 1895 did not include the islets within the boundaries of Shimane Prefecture, the Japanese region. 
 Another map from 1904 painted Dokdo in lavender, the same color as Korea’s Gangwon Province, the institute stated.
 Dokdo has been a diplomatic hot potato between the two countries. Currently, South Korea keeps a small police detachment on the islets.
