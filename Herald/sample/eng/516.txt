More gold medals for Korean speed skaters
Korean speed skaters and Olympic champions Mo Tae-bum and Lee Sang-hwa each won gold medals in 500-meter events at the ISU Essent World Single Distance Championships, according to Yonhap News.
 In the four-day Championships held in Heerenveen, the Netherlands, Mo beat the Netherlands’ Michel Mulder by just .01 of a second with 69.64 seconds in his two try outs.
 Lee Sang-hwa also won a gold medal, the first female Korean to do so, in the tournament by defeating China’s Yu Jing, with a combined score of 75.69. 
 It was a revenge win for Lee after losing to her Chinese rival in the 500 meters at the ISU Speed Skating World Cup in Berlin last month.
