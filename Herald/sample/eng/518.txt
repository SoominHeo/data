Famous acid victim commits suicide
Fakhra Younus, a famous Pakistani acid attack victim who endured more than three dozen surgeries over more than a decade, committed suicide on March 17. 
The 33-year-old former dancer girl was attacked with acid by her then-husband, Bilal Khar, while she was sleeping in May 2000. Khar was a prominent ex-lawmaker and son of a former governor of Pakistan’s largest province, Punjab. The attack on Younus brought international attention to the plight of women in Pakistan, where “more than 8,500 acid attacks, forced marriages and other forms of violence against women were reported in 2011,” AP reported. 
Younus’ suicide comes less than a month after a Pakistani filmmaker won the country’s first Oscar for a documentary about acid attack victims.
