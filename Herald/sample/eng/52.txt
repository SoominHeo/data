Fun English program at Hallym University
An English education program between the Korean government and Canada’s public education offices proved its worth at the program’s end.
 The special program driven by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Canada’s educational organizations, including the Peel International Education Alliance, was held from July 25 to Aug. 12 at Hallym University in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province.
 “At the program’s beginning, I was not very good at making myself understood in English, but as the program proceeded, I could see much improvement in my language command, helped by foreign teachers, who were very friendly and professional,” Choi Ye-in, first grader of Dongmyeong Middle School said during an interview.
 The program also strives to bridge the educational gap between the poor and rich by inviting students from the underprivileged class, such as low-income or multiethnic families, before others.
 Domenico Grande, a Canadian faculty member, said he got to know the program through Korean English teachers who had visited Canada for their English education training. Domenico himself taught at an English language institute in Korea from 2001 to 2004. He recalled his old memories of playing gonggi, a Korean traditional game, with Korean students back then.
 Before the program started, the Korean and Canadian teachers had gone thorough an intensive workshop session to boost inter-cultural understanding and to prepare the most efficient and effective curriculum of all.
 The three-week education included not only in-class study but other activities including athletics and English musical performances. On Thursday, a day before the program’s closing, all participating students divided into nine groups staged such musicals as “Cats,” “Mama Mia,” “The Sound of Music,” and many others.
