Study finds certain vegetables can improve cancer survival
A U.S. study found that women who ate cabbage, broccoli and other leafy greens saw better survival rates after breast cancer than women who did not, AFP reported. 
The findings are part of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival study, which collected data on 4,886 Chinese breast cancer survivors between the ages of 20 and 75, who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2006. According to the data collected, women who ate more cruciferous vegetables lowered their risk of dying of breast cancer by 22 to 62 percent, and the chances of breast cancer coming back dropped by 21 to 35 percent as well. 
The study was presented at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Chicago on April 3.
