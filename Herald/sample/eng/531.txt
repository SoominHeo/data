Building set to be Europe’s tallest skyscraper catches fire
The top portion of a partially-built skyscraper in Moscow that was set to become Europe’s tallest building caught fire on April 2, pushing back its completion date. 
The building’s owner, Sergei Polonsky, assured that there were no casualties and no threat of collapse in an interview with the Russia 24 television channel. Polonsky went on further to explain that the fire spread quickly across the top floor of the building due to strong winds. 
The tower, along with its twin Zapad, or West tower, makes up the Federation complex, “under plans to turn the Russian capital into a global financial center,” Reuters reported.
