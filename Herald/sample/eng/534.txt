Outlook for Korean economy gloomy, says Finance Minister
The stubborn global economic downturn is posing challenges to the South Korean economy, as it stymies growth momentum, the country’s top economic policymaker has said. 
 “The Korean economy faces difficulties from eurozone problems, the standoff over Iran’s nuclear ambitions and possible U.S. economic downturn,” Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan said at a weekly meeting of economic ministers.
 According to Bahk, Korea “relies heavily on autos and semiconductor exports.” 
He pointed out that the country needs to fend off the global economic slump by establishing strong fundamentals, allowing more flexibility in business, and enhancing corporate transparency and accountability.
