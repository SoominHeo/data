Celebration held for world’s oldest person
The world’s oldest person, who lives in Georgia, the United States, celebrated her 115th birthday.
 Beese Cooper, the Guinness Book record holder in age, became the oldest after Maria Gomes Valentin of Brazil died on June 21.
 Within the U.S., Cooper became the oldest resident of Georgia in January 2009, and she is also the second oldest person ever from Tennessee.
 The oldest lady enjoyed two slivers of her birthday cake and nodded with approval as a musician sang Tennessee Waltz in her 115th birthday party, said AP.
 According to other news reports, she spends 80 percent of her day sleeping, but thinks clearly and remembers things well.
 For the secrets to her longevity, she said she minds her own business and does not east junk food, said the news reports.
