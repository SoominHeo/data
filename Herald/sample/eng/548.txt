Study shows not enough sleep can lead to health complications
A new U.S. study has found that insufficient or disrupted sleep leads to an increased risk of diabetes and obesity. 
Orfeu Buxton, a neuroscientist and sleep researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, conducted a lab experiment with 21 test subjects who were only allowed to sleep 5.6 hours in a 24-hour period for three weeks. 
The results showed a slowdown in the subjects’ metabolism and reduction in insulin production; changes which can lead to weight gain and increased blood sugar. The study was published April 11 in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
