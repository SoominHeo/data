Earthquake rocks Indonesia
Two earthquakes off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia rocked the nation, knocking out the electricity and triggering a tsunami warning on April 12. 
A reported five people in the Aceh province have died as a result of the two earthquakes with magnitudes registered at 8.6 and 8.2, respectively. For many residents, it brought back terrifying memories of the 2004 tsunami that left over 200,000 dead in the region. 
The earthquake triggered tsunami warnings for countries ranging from Indonesia to Thailand, India, Australia, Oman and South Africa. They were lifted just hours later.
