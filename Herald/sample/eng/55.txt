Education Ministry steps up efforts for e-class
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said all Korean classrooms will be equipped with digital textbooks by 2015, freeing students from carrying heavy books around on their backs.
 Digital textbooks will include not only reference books and workbooks but also dictionaries and notebooks in them, according to the ministry officials.
 “The planned digitalization of all classrooms by 2015 will be made possible largely due to Korean students’ high e-literacy rate,” said the officials.
 In a digital reading assessment test held by the OECD in 2009, Korean students topped the list, followed by those from New Zealand and Australia. The test named PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) was held for students from 15 OECD member nations.
