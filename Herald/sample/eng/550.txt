Summary of April 11 election
South Korea’s ruling Saenuri Party clung on to its majority party in the nation’s National Assembly by winning 152 out of the 300 seats on April 11 general election. At stake in this year’s elections were 246 directly voted members of the National Assembly as well as 54 seats that were chosen through proportional representation. 
 The ruling party gained 25 more seats than the main opposition Democratic United Party (DUP), which won 127 seats in total. Taking 21 seats through proportional representation, the DUP put up an impressive fight against the Saenuri Party. Compared to the previous general election four years ago, the party garnered nearly 50 more seats in this election.
 Other minor opposition parties however, didn’t fare well. The Liberty Forward Party captured only five seats, down 13 seats from the 18th general election and The Unified Progressive Party (UPP) grabbed 13 seats. Three independent candidates also managed to win seats on April 11. 
 The ruling Saenuri party won all seats in Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province and Gangwon Province but their total number of seats was 13 short from that of the 18th general elections. A local news agency said this was likely due to “troubling domestic economic issues such as a growing income gap and inflation putting a heavy burden on the majority of voters.” 
 The turnout for the 19th general elections was 54.3 percent. Out of the 42 million eligible voters in the country, about 23 million voters cast their ballots. Compared to the 2010 local elections, the turnout was 0.2 percent lower, Yonhap News said.
 The highest voter turnout was reported in Seoul’s Sejong City with 59.2 percent, whereas Incheon City posted the lowest figure at 51.4 percent.
 The election has been regarded as a critical judgment for potential presidential candidates, as the nation is about to face the presidential election this December. It is the first time in 20 years that the general and presidential elections have fallen in the same year. 
 Analysts forecast the harsh public sentiment toward the incumbent administration’s economic policies would give opposition parties the upper hand in the elections, but the parties have botched their chances by making disappointing candidate choices. 
 After the votes were revealed, the DUP conceded its defeat. “We will deeply reflect upon the meaning of the election and try ceaselessly to be reborn as a party that the people can rely on,” said DUP spokeswoman Park Sun-sook.
 Meanwhile, a win for the ruling party might have given a big boost to presumed presidential candidate Park Geun-hye, the current chairwoman of the ruling Saenuri party. Pundits largely credited Park for saving the conservative party against the liberal opposition coalition of the DUP and UPP.
 The ruling party firmly stated that it would fulfill its pledges. Lee Hye-hoon, the chief campaigner for the Saenuri Party said, “We will keep the promises we made to the people without fail.” Hearing the news of election victory, the Blue House also issued a statement that it was grateful to the people for their “wise choices.”
