Top shipbuilders tap into offshore development
Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo are some of the most well-known brand names at home and abroad in shipbuilding, and the three are now focusing on winning orders for global offshore plants and related manufacturing projects, The Korea Herald reported.
 Industry sources said the offshore plant business appeared to be a new growth engine for Hyundai Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and Samsung Heavy Industries.
 Backed by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy and the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, the offshore plant business is expected to further serve as a stepping stone for the three to become total engineering, procurement and construction companies in the sector, according to industrial sources.
 Korea’s shipbuilders are best-known for procurement and construction of offshore production facilities, drill ships, floating production storage and offloading units.
 Korean companies’ increasing interest in offshore projects comes as the global slowdown in the shipping industry stemming from Europe’s financial crisis is reducing orders for cargo vessels, The Korea Herald said referring to industrial sources. Also, this is in line with Korea’s aims to tap offshore oil and gas, it added.
 Global orders to build offshore and related projects won by the big three reached $9.6 billion as of the end of the first quarter of 2012, and Korean companies are grabbing nearly 80 percent of global orders, thanks to their price competitiveness and shipbuilding know-how.
