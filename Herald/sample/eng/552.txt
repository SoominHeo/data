Animal testing on mice
A cooler lab environment for lab mice leads to more reliable lab results, said a report by BBC Science. 
According to scientists who studied the traits of lab mice, the animals relish temperatures of a little over 30 degrees Celsius. 
However, most laboratories do not keep this temperature, and instead are usually 5 or 10 degrees below this level. Scientists argue that this is because when mice are exposed to a warmer environment, they tend to become unmanageably aggressive. 
Another downside to a slightly higher lab temperature, the scientists claim, is that mice eat more than they usually do in a cooler environment to keep their body temperatures. This brings about physiological changes in mice and alters the way these animals metabolize drugs during trials. As a result, less accurate and possibly unreliable lab results may be obtained, the report noted. 
In this study, Dr. Joseph Garner of Stanford University and his research team let dozens of mice roam freely between two cages that were connected by a narrow tube. One cage was kept warm at up to 35 Celsius. The other cage was kept at 20 Celsius, including ten grams of finely shredded paper. The pieces of paper were added to allow the mice to make a nest. 
In the report, published in the journal Public Library of Science, Garner said that the mice showed no preference between the warmer and cooler cages. Thus, he suggested that labs should maintain cooler temperatures instead of keeping them warm and force mice to cope with the low temperatures as if they were in their natural habitat. 
He concluded that even though mice may be happier in warm temperatures, the risk of compromising lab results by exposing them to such an environment is too high. ã€€
