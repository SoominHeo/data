Elite Asian swimmers vie for Olympic glory
When swimming competitions for men begin at the 2012 London Olympic Games, the eyes of the world will once again focus on star swimmers such as Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte of the United States, James Magnussen of Australia, Paul Biedermann of Germany, César Cielo Filho of Brazil, Dániel Gyurta of Hungary, Alexander Dale Oen of Norway, and Liam John Tancock of Great Britain. However, the burden of defending Asia’s honor in the Olympic swimming pool will fall on the shoulders of a trio of elite athletes – a national sensation from Korea, a living legend from Japan, and an emerging star from China.
 Park Tae-hwan is by far the most accomplished member of the Korean national swimming team. After taking up swimming to combat asthma at the age of 5, Park progressed rapidly through junior ranks and became a member of the national team at age 14. He specialized in distance events (400m and 1,500m) initially and was noted for great pace and stamina. At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, Canada, Park won two gold medals (in the 1500 meter freestyle and the 400 meter freestyle) and one silver medal (in the 200 meter freestyle). Park’s greatest triumph came at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games when he became the first Korean swimmer to win an Olympic medal. He won a gold medal in the 400 meter freestyle event and a silver medal (finishing second to Michael Phelps) in the 200 meter freestyle event. Park is considered a medal favorite in the 200m and 400m freestyle at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
 Kosuke Kitajima of Japan is one of the most decorated swimmers in the world with multiple gold medals in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, Asian Games, and the Pan Pacific Championships; and he doesn’t even look like a swimmer. Standing at only 1.78 meters, Kitajima does not have the tall, tapered physique and large reach of a prototype champion swimmer. What he possesses instead is impeccable breaststroke technique featuring powerful kicks, long glides, and streamlined strokes. Kitajima won gold medals in the 200m and 400m breaststroke events at the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, he became a double gold medalist by winning the 200m and 400m breaststroke events. He successfully defended both titles at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games while setting a new world record at the 100m distance. At age 29, Kitajima once again qualified for both events at the London Games and will be looking for a historic “three-peat.”
 Sun Yang is a 21-year-old distance-swimming prodigy from China. A physical marvel standing at 198cm tall and weighing 81kg, he has eclipsed fellow countryman and Olympic champion Zhang Lin and emerged as one of the best long-distance freestyle swimmers in the world. Sun burst onto the scene by winning the 1,500m at the Chinese National Championships in 2007 and qualified for the 400m and 1,500m events at the Beijing Olympic Games. At the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, Sun won the gold medal in the 1,500m freestyle and was the runner-up to Park Tae-hwan in both the 200m and 400m events. At the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai, Sun confirmed his status as the best long distance swimmer in the world by winning gold in both the 800m and the 1,500m freestyle events. He also broke the world record in the 1,500m freestyle, long-held by Australian swimming legend Grant Hackett. It was the longest-held world record in swimming, and the only men’s swimming record not to have been beaten during the “techsuit” era. At the 2012 London Olympic Games, Sun is aiming to capture gold in the 1,500m and 400m freestyle events.
