India successfully tests missile
India successfully launched a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead on April 19, BBC News reported. 
An Indian-developed Agni-V missile was tested, whose range reaches more than 5,000 km and is reported to be the “cornerstone of India’s missile-based nuclear deterrent.” 
The test launch was a “deterrent to avoid wars and ... is not country-specific,” Ravi Gupta, spokesman for the Defense Research and Development Organization, was quoted as saying by AFP.
 India is one of a few nations with such long-range missile capabilities, joining the ranks of China, Russia, France, the U.S. and the U.K.
