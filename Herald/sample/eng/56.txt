Singapore elects 7th President
Former Singapore Prime Minister Tony Tan was elected the 7th President of the country on Aug. 27.
 Mr. Tan, 71, won 35 percent of the votes in a close race against Tan Cheng Bok, former member of Singaporean Parliament.
 The votes held on Saturday were recounted as those between the top two candidates were too close.
 According to AP, Tan pledged to work his utmost for Singaporeans “whatever be their political affiliation.” He added that the presidency was above politics.
 In the election, Tan was supported by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and other ministers and trade unions even though he ran as an independent candidate.
 Prime Minister Lee’s father is the well-known leader Lee Kuan Yew, who led the country to independence in 1965.
