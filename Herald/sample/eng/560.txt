Angelina Jolie promoted to special U.N. refugee envoy
The United Nations refugee agency has recently promoted Hollywood star Angelina Jolie from goodwill ambassador to special envoy after more than a decade of supporting refugee causes around the world, AP reported. 
Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency has said that this is the first time that a special envoy has been named. Such posts are usually reserved for career diplomats or retired politicians. 
According to AP, the new position will focus on the “complex crises that result in the mass displacement of people.” On special occasions, the recently-engaged Jolie will also represent the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres.
