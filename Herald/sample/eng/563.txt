Rabies alert in South Korea
A rabies alert was made across the country after a dog tested positive in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province. 
The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ordered that all domestic animals in the vicinity of the farm be inoculated against the disease.
 In South Korea, there has been no report of rabies since 1993 in Gangwon Province, except for one case in the DMZ area in 2011.
