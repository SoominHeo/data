Google unveils new online storage service, Drive
On April 24, Google launched its Drive service, adding to a growing list of available online storage services.
 Similar to existing online storage services such as Apple’s iCloud and Microsoft’s SkyDrive, Google Drive provides users with 5 GB of free storage space, or more if users are willing to pay a monthly fee of up to $50 a month. 
The good news is that since Google’s Drive service is already integrated with the existing Docs service, sharing and editing documents will be easier and more straightforward. On the flip side, Google has been plagued with a poor reputation for user privacy, which makes it “hard to imagine a company that would trust Google to keep their information safe,” Rob Enderle, an analyst at the Enderle Group, was quoted as saying in Computerworld.
