After the storm
Most of the worst effects of Hurricane Irene came from the rains that fell inland, rather than the storm surge along the coast as it had forecasted. Pennsylvania and New Jersey residents are keeping an eye on water levels as an hours’ worth of rain begins to drain into nearby rivers and creeks.
 Vermont is also on the lookout, as normally small streams turned into raging torrents overnight. In fact, a video posted on Facebook showed a 141-year old covered bridge in Rockingham being swept away by the overflowing Williams River. 
In New York, water levels in the Hudson River are running high as well, but residents have a more pressing problem to deal with; getting to work. Though limited services are being restored in the city’s transit system, commuters are told to expect long lines and waits. Not all subway stops will be open due to flooding. 
Those bound for airports in New York and the Northeast are also dealing with the backlog of hundreds of thousands of passengers whose flights were cancelled over the weekend. 
Officials on the ground all over the East Coast are working on repairing hundreds of damaged roads while power companies have to cut through uprooted trees in order to reconnect the power lines. 
Though the storm may be over, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has asked residents to be on the lookout during the next two days for rising waters. In fact, inland flooding is equally as dangerous as coastal flooding due to flashfloods and rivers rising quickly from the continual rainfall. 
President Barack Obama addressed the nation on Aug. 28, saying that “It’s going to take time to recover from a storm of this magnitude.” He added that even though the storm has passed, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to assist in the recovery and rebuilding of those affected by the storm.
