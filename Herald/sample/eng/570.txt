Mad cow disease discovered in U.S.
For the first time since 2006, mad cow disease was discovered by chance at the heart of Californiaâ€™s dairy country, AP reported.
 The results of a random sample of dead animals tested by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) showed that the cow in question had an atypical form of mad cow disease. John Clifford, chief veterinary officer of the USDA, explained that this meant the cow did not get the disease from infected cattle feed. Rather, it is a random mutation that can happen every once in a while.
 In response, two major South Korean retailers have suspended sales of U.S. beef while Japan has said that there is no reason to restrict imports.
