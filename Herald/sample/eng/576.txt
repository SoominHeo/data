Battle against measles falls short of WHO target
Global efforts to root out measles deaths have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) target, a BBC Health and Science report said.
 An analysis published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, showed deaths from measles had fallen by 74 percent between 2000 and 2010, shy of the WHO target of 90 percent.
 In 2000, deaths from measles stood at 535,300 and the number fell to 139,300 in 2010. Africa and India accounted for 79 percent of the combined total of measles deaths from 2000 to 2010, the Measles and Rubella Initiative, a collaboration of international organizations including the WHO stated.
 The organization said the decline in measles deaths was strong up to 2007, but between 2008 and 2009 the figure was disappointing due to outbreaks in Africa, Asia and even in Europe. Researchers added outbreaks in Africa and delayed vaccination in India have played a big role in thwarting the progress. 
 Anthony Lake, the executive director of the United Nations children’s organization UNICEF, which is a part of the Measles and Rubella Initiative, said that there have been 382 deaths from measles every day. “Every one of them could have been saved by a vaccine.” However, Lake noted the 74 percent drop in deaths reflected vaccine campaigns’ success in the global fight against the disease “even in the poorest countries and the remotest regions.” 
 The next target is a 95 percent drop in deaths from their 2000 levels set by 2015.
 Dr Okwo-Bele, director of immunization, vaccines and biologicals at the WHO, said: “We have reason to be optimistic that the 95 percent goal will be achieved by 2015.”
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that causes a fever, coughing and distinctive red-brown spots on the skin. The disease is contracted from an infected person’s coughs or sneezes. Complications of measles include pneumonia, ear and eye infections and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), which can be fatal.
