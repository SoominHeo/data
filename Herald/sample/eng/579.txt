Who do you think is the richest fictional character?
Batman and Iron Man are two fictional superheroes whose special powers are being super rich. But what would their actual net worth be if they were real? And who would be richer?
 Every year, Forbes Magazine crunches the numbers to figure out the 15 richest characters in the world of fiction. According to Forbes’ calculations, Tony Stark (“Iron Man”) ranks fifth on the list of the Fictional 15 with $9.3 billion, while Bruce Wayne (“Batman”) stands at number eight with $6.9 billion.
 To put things into perspective, Forbes estimated that Steve Jobs was worth $7 billion at the time of his death. 
Number one on the list is Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit,” due to make his big screen debut in December. Described as possessing “countless piles of precious things,” Smaug’s net worth is calculated by Forbes as standing at $62 billion. That’s $3 billion more than Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, and just $7 billion less than the richest non-fictional person in the world according to Forbes, Carlos Slim Helu of Mexico. 
Unlike the current financial troubles of the real world, the fictional world seems to be booming. This year, the aggregate net worth of the Fictional 15 stands at $209.5 billion, “up a stunning 59 percent from last year,” Forbes reported. It’s also enough money to give $30 to every real person on the planet.
