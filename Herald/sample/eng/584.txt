Harvard, MIT to offer free online courses
The prestigious Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have partnered up recently to offer free online courses in an initiative called edX, Reuters reported. 
Harvard and MIT each committed $30 million to the project, which will allow students from all over to earn certificates for completing course work online. 
“EdX gives Harvard and MIT an unprecedented opportunity to dramatically extend our collective reach by conducting groundbreaking research into effective education and by extending online access to quality higher education,” Harvard President Drew Faust said.
 Although certificates may be acquired once the student completes the course work, diplomas are reserved for only those admitted by the schools and attending classes in person.
