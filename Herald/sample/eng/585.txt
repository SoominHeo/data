World’s oldest blood sample discovered
Scientists were able to recover the world’s oldest sample of blood recently from the 5,300-year-old “Iceman” mummy, discovered in an Alpine glacier on the Austrian-Italian border in 1991, National Geographic News reported.
 Although an extensive postmortem study on Ötzi the Iceman had been conducted since its discovery, no blood residue was previously detected until a pioneering nano-sized probe was used. 
“We got very typical samples for blood, like the [blood protein] hemoglobin,” Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy was quoted as saying.
 Zink said the recent discovery “really is the oldest clear evidence for red blood cells.”
