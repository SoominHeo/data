Korea-China FTA on its way
The South Korean government announced on May 2 that it would begin free trade negotiations with China to tear down trade barriers between Asia’s two big economies.
 Park Tae-ho, South Korean Trade Minister said during a press briefing in Beijing that the first round of talks on the Korea-China FTA will begin as early as later this month. 
 The handling of sensitive items - in Korea’s case, agricultural and fisheries goods, and for China’s part, automobiles, machinery and petroleum products - will be discussed at the talks. Whether to apply preferential tariffs on products manufactured in Gaeseong industrial complex in North Korea will also be a sensitive topic. 
 China is South Korea’s largest trading partner; the bilateral trade is expected to reach $300 billion by 2015, Yonhap News said.
