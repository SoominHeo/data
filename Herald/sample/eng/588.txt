Suicide is leading cause of death among young Koreans
Suicide was the single largest cause of death in young Koreans for the third straight year in 2010. According to Statistics Korea, it is a clear reflection of the heavy burden that the younger generation of Korea feels today.
 Statistics Korea revealed that 13 out of every 100,000 people aged between 15 and 24 committed suicide in the cited year and the majority of respondents said they had borne suicidal thoughts before due to education-related competition, dismal economic conditions and worries about the future.
