Australian koala under threat
Some parts of Australia have listed the koala as a threatened species, a reflection of the dwindling population of the country’s iconic animal, according to Australian government officials.
 Australian Environment Minister Tony Burke pointed out that in areas of Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, the koala is considered a “vulnerable” animal species. He cited habitat loss, urban expansion, vehicle strikes, dog attacks and disease as the main causes of the striking population decline.
 The decision to put koala on the endangered list was made through “a rigorous scientific assessment” by a committee which deals with threatened species, says Burke.
 “We’re talking about a species that is not only iconic in Australia, but is known worldwide, a species that has taken a massive hit over the last 20 years and we can’t wait any longer before we turn the corner when the scientists are telling us the evidence is in,” he said.
 But there is a slight silver lining; a BBC report claims the current size of the koala population is unclear, with estimates varying from several hundred thousand to as few as 43,000. This means not all parts of Australia are at risk of losing the cherished animal.
 The koala number has fallen by as much as 40 percent since 1990 in New South Wales and Queensland but in states like Victoria and South Australia, it has rather been thriving, the report added. 
 Noting the animal’s varying number across the country, Mr. Burke stated, “While koala populations are clearly declining in some areas, there are large, stable or even increasing populations in other areas.” 
 “The koala is such an important tourist icon and such an important symbol to Australia,” Deborah Tabart of the Australian Koala Foundation said. She urged the necessity of blanket protection for koalas living in Australia.
