Rivers of ice
In high mountains there are places that are packed full of ice. These ice packs are called “glaciers” and look like giant frozen rivers. And like rivers, glaciers flow - but usually so slowly you can’t see them move.
 It takes a long time to make a glacier. First, snow falls on the mountains. It collects year after year, until there is a thick layer called a “snowfield.”
 In summer the surface of the snowfield melts and sinks into the snow below it. There it freezes and forms a layer of ice. This too happens year after year, until most of the snowfield has been changed into ice. The snowfield is now a glacier.
 The snow and ice in a glacier can become very thick and heavy. The glacier then begins to actually move under its own weight and creeps down the mountain valley. It has now become a valley glacier.
 The valley glacier moves slowly but with enormous force. As it moves, it scrapes the sides of the mountain and tears off pieces of it. Sometimes it tears off chunks as big as a house. As the glacier moves down the mountain into warmer regions, the ice begins to melt. The icy water fills rivers and streams.
 Many thousands of years ago, much of the Earth’s surface was covered with moving glaciers. This period is sometimes called the Ice Age. As the world warmed, most of the ice melted away and formed many of the rivers, lakes, and seas around us today — including the Great Lakes in North America, which have an area greater than the entire Korean Peninsula.
