Google’s driverless car approved for road test
Nevada has approved a license for Google to test a driverless Toyota Prius on its roads recently, much to the delight of technology fans everywhere. 
In a statement regarding the license approval, Bruce Breslow, director of Nevada’s Department of Motor Vehicles called autonomous vehicles the “car of the future,” adding that plans to eventually make autonomous vehicle licenses available to the public were under way. 
According to The Guardian, the autonomous cars still need a human to sit in the driver’s seat, but it “will be able to operate, steer and navigate itself” using the driverless technology developed by Stanford professor and Google vice-president, Sebastian Thrun.
