Regional currency swap in Asia to be doubled
Three Asian nations, South Korea, China and Japan, have decided to double the size of a regional currency swap agreement so that they could better prepare for the possible liquidity crunch, Yonhap News reported. 
 The three agreed in the ASEAN Plus Three ministerial and central bankersâ€™ meeting held in Manila in May to extend the size of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) fund from $120 billion to $240 billion. The fund was launched in 2010 to guard regional nations against global economic challenges and to help financially challenged countries in the region. 
South Korea will contribute $38.4 billion (16 percent) of the total amount. China and Japan will provide 32 percent each and the rest will be shared among ASEAN member countries.
