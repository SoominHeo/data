More than 100 kids are rich stock holders
The number of kids in South Korea with stock holdings of more than 100 million won reached 100 for the first time this April, data by Chaebol.com showed. 
 The firm, which provides information about large domestic conglomerates, said that many company owners had retired this year and handed down their wealth to their children. 
 This is because, according to the firm, the tax for handing down parentsâ€™ stocks to their kids was reduced this year. As of April 2012, there are 102 children in Korea who hold sizable shares in listed companies, up from 87 kids the same period last year.
 The practice will help these children take in charge of these companies later on in their life, says Yonhap News.
