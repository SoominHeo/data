The leaders of South Korea, China and Japan agreed to start official negotiations on a trilateral free trade agreement this year during their annual meeting in Beijing on May 13.
 President Lee Myung-bak, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda discussed their cooperation in business, trade, security and other pending issues during the talks.
 During the summit, the three countries also signed an agreement aimed at setting legal, institutional grounds to protect their investors operating in each other’s territories.
 The first economic deal between the three Asian nations features a fair treatment of foreign investors, strengthened protection of intellectual property and a ban on toughening investment-related regulations.
 At the South Korea-Japan-China Business Summit held after the leaders’ talks, Lee said that the trilateral FTA would contribute to prosperity in Northeast Asia and the resolution of the economic crisis facing the world.
 “To overcome today’s economic crisis, I believe expanding free trade and international cooperation are important,” he said during his keynote speech at the Business Summit.
 “Korea signed free trade deals with 45 nations including the U.S. and the E.U., and has become a free trade hub that links the world’s market, and accounts for 61 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.”
 Later in the day, Lee and the Chinese premier held bilateral talks where they agreed to expand security and military cooperation, and improve collaboration in future growth engines such as energy and green growth.
 They also agreed to deepen their friendship through cultural and people-to-people exchanges as the two countries marked the 20th anniversary of their diplomatic ties.
