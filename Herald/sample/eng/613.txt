Nepal takes first step towards unified government
A unified Nepalese national government was sworn in on May 16, with Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai welcoming seven new ministers from various parties into a 20-member cabinet. 
The formation of the new government is expected to pave the way for a new constitution, the drafting process for which has been “held up for years due to bickering over the electoral system, system of governance and division of provinces,” the New York Daily News reported. 
The drafting of a new constitution has been delayed since a peace pact was agreed upon in 2006, ending a decade-long civil war between Maoists and the government.
