Group warns against use of unsafe sunscreens
According to the 2012 Sunscreen Guide released by the Environmental Working Group, only 25 percent of 800 sunscreens tested were found to be effective in protecting against harmful UV radiation without the use of potentially toxic ingredients.
 “The results are slightly better than previous years, but it continues to surprise us that we can recommend such few products,” Nneka Leiba, an Environmental Working Group senior analyst, was quoted as saying by CNN.
 When choosing sunscreens, the watchdog group suggests lotions over sprays with a minimum of SPF 15 and maximum of SPF 50. They also advise making sure that it does not contain the ingredients oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate, and that it offers both UVA and UVB protection (broad spectrum protection).
