Virtual orchestra revolutionizes orchestra experience
A museum in London is providing visitors a chance to experience an orchestra in a whole new light through the use of sophisticated technologies. 
The “Universe of Sound” exhibit uses specially shot footage, immersive sound and 360 degree projections provides an unusually close-up view of the impressive Philharmonia Orchestra, while a virtual conductor program uses three-dimensional motion sensors to allow visitors the chance to understand what it means to be in the conductor’s stand.
 “At the end of the whole installation you become part of the entirety,” David Whelton, the museum‘s managing director, was quoted as saying by AP. “You become part of the Philharmonia.”
 “Universe of Sound” opened on May 23 at the Science Museum in London.
