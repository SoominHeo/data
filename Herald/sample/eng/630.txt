Seoul to send humanitarian aid to Yemen
South Korea will provide Yemen with $500,000 in humanitarian aid to help the Arab nation fight its daunting food crisis, the Foreign Ministry has said.
A year of fighting between government forces and militants linked to al-Qaida has paralyzed Yemen’s economy and aggravated its food crisis, said Cho Byung-jae, spokesman for South Korean Foreign Ministry. 
 “Our government will actively participate in discussions on the support and development of the Yemeni economy as a responsible member of international society,” he said.
