Cutting nation’s fuel consumption top priority
The South Korean government unveiled a package of measures to reduce Korea’s fuel use to head off high prices.
 Among the measures included are extending tax breaks to people driving or buying smaller hybrid cars and offering tax deductions of up to 1 million won to those who take public transport when they pay fares by credit card.
 With the help of the package, the government aims to drop the country’s energy-dependence to 33 percent and cut the use of oil by 26 million barrels by 2015, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said.
 Oil made up 40 percent of the overall energy consumption in South Korea in 2010 and the number is expected to fall to 37.5 percent this year.
 The price of gasoline has passed 2,000 won a liter and there is no sign of a fall anytime soon, according to industry experts. Given the steady rise of price of gasoline and diesel fuel, an immediate adoption of the measures is advised for countries like Korea that import all of their crude oil.
 In the first quarter of this year, Korea imported $26.9 billion worth of crude, a slight increase from last year’s $22.6 billion, said the ministry, which is in charge of the government’s energy policy.
 In line with government’s efforts to slash the country’s energy consumption, domestic automakers will also be advised to elevate the fuel efficiency of their vehicles to up to 17 kilometers per liter by 2015, in tandem with rival European and Japanese car makers. The former targets its fuel efficiency to 22.8 kilometers per liter and the latter plans to raise it to 20.3 kilometers per liter by 2020. Today, Korean cars boast of their average fuel efficiency of 15.5 kilometers per liter. 
The industrial sector makes up 57.3 percent of Korea’s overall oil consumption and the government promised that industries which switch to greener energy sources, such as nuclear power, will also be eligible to earn larger government subsidies, the ministry said.
