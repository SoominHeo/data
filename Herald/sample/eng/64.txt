Fouls change athletes’ destiny
Unintended fouls have changed the fate of some runners in 2011 Daegu World Championships.
 The world’s fastest man Usain Bolt was disqualified on Aug. 28 after he started too early in the 100 meters final.
 He told AFP that he needed time to digest his disqualification.
 Running in lane five, the Jamaican superstar immediately realized his mistake and tore off his shirt showing disbelief at what he did.
 Athletics governing body, the IAAF, said that Bolt’s false start was disappointing but that a sport’s rules had to be applied consistently and fairly.
 Meanwhile, another Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake won the race securing his season’s best time of 9.92 seconds.
 “I can’t find words to explain it. Usain Bolt has been there for me. I feel like I want to cry,” Blake told AFP.
 And there was another unfortunate event in the men’s 110 meters hurdles on Aug. 29.
 Dayron Robles, world record holder in the event, seemed to have outrun all others in the race, but he was disqualified for obstructing Liu Xiang of China. The Cuban team had lodged an appeal but it was rejected.
 Robles chased after China’s favorite Liu Xiang for most of the race, but when his competitor wavered, the Cuban flew past in a dogfight with the U.S.’s Jason Richardson.
 Cheered on by a large visiting crowd from China, Liu had the lead till the last hurdle, but lost focus when he glanced at his competitors and was unable to regain his composure by the finish.
 Richardson has no national titles but ran the best time in the semifinals by 0.2 seconds, coming out of left field in the semifinal and final, and finished just two hundredths of a second after Robles.
 The disqualification meant that Richardson took gold, Liu silver and Britain’s Andrew Turner bronze.
 Largely seen as a favorite to win, Richardson’s compatriot David Oliver showed a disappointing performance with a 13.44 finish, half a second behind his season record, placing fifth.
