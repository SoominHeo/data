Obama awards top civilian honor to 13 people
President Barack Obama awarded the United States’ top civilian honor to musician Bob Dylan, novelist Toni Morrison and 11 other luminaries in a packed ceremony at the White House on May 29.
 “What sets these men and women apart is the incredible impact they have had on so many people - not in short, blinding bursts, but steadily, over the course of a lifetime,” Obama said of the Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.
 “They have enriched our lives and they have changed our lives for the better.”
 Recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom come from a variety of different fields. 
Musician Bob Dylan, who has had a recording career spanning five decades, won 11 Grammys and was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2009, was described by the White House as being one of “the most influential American musicians of the 20th century.”
 Another honoree, Dolores Huerta, is a labor activist who was influential in advocating for the civil rights of agricultural workers and women. John Doar, a senior official at the Justice Department during the 1960s, was commended for laying the groundwork for racial equality and voting rights in the U.S. 
Epidemiologist William Foege was praised for his work in successfully eradicating the smallpox disease in the 1970s, while Gordon Hirabayashi was honored for fighting against the Japanese-American internment during World War II.
 Obama also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to two people who have died. Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low and Polish Underground officer Jan Karski.
 Other honorees include novelist Toni Morrison, retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, astronaut and former Senator John Glenn, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli President Shimon Peres and Pat Summit, a retired women’s basketball coach at the University of Tennessee.
