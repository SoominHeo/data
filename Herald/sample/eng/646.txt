Chinese bloggers face crackdown on censorship
Sina Weibo, one of China’s largest micro-blogs, imposed new “user contracts” on May 28 to track and punish users posting comments deemed inappropriate by its editors and government censors.
 The new “user contracts” are designed to use a point-based system to stem the growing number of Chinese bloggers who circumvent the censors with puns and homonyms. Each of the 300 million Sina Weibo users are awarded a starting score of 80 points, which can be deducted for comments judged to be offensive. Once a blogger reaches zero, the user’s account will be canceled. 
The new rules were announced earlier in May and took effect on May 28.
