Data shows children‘s addiction to Internet
A government study showed on May 30 that almost 4 percent of Korean teenagers are highly likely to be addicted to the Internet.
 The survey of 1.7 million youths by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Education Ministry revealed that 3.9 percent of the participants, or 68,044, were grouped as “high-risk” or “at-risk” Internet users.
 A government official involved in the study explained that the rate had gone down from the previous year’s 4.94 percent but that it was still high.
 “The ratio of students at risk of addiction has been on the decline in recent years, helped by increased public awareness, governmental measures and campaigns,” he said.
 The study was conducted on fourth graders in elementary schools, first graders in middle schools and first year students in high schools nationwide.
 About 0.9 percent of the participants, or 16,714, belonged to the high-risk group. They feel the need to be online and experience withdrawal symptoms when they do not use the Internet for significant periods of time. For elementary school fourth-graders in this group, the average daily Internet use exceeds 3 hours.
 The at-risk group accounted for 2.6 percent of the participants. This group feels insecure when they are offline for long periods of time. The average level of Internet use for elementary fourth-graders in this group is two hours a day.
 Teen Internet or online game addiction has been a social problem in Korea, one of the world’s most wired nations.
 In November 2011, the government started an online game curfew, blocking those under age 16 from logging onto online game sites from midnight to 6 a.m.
