Korea to make world’s first geostationary environmental satellite
The Korean government is scheduled to develop an artificial satellite by 2015 to help the country better brace for the damage from climate change.
 The geostationary environmental satellite, the world’s first of its kind, will monitor climate change in Northeast Asia from geostationary orbit. 
 American and European countries have already placed their own satellites for the same purpose, but only into non-geostationary orbit, the Ministry of Environment noted.
 The satellite will keep in check the changes in the level of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and other toxic materials in the atmosphere during the daytime to help minimize damage from climate change in Northeast Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea.
 According to the ministry, the device will be used for at least 10 years.
 Satellite history
 The world‘s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Since then a few space probes have been placed into orbit and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun.　
 Satellites serve various purposes. They are used for military, civilian Earth observation, communications, navigation, weather-monitoring, and research purposes. Depending on its purpose, they take different types of orbit: low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.
 A geostationary orbit, also called as Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), refers to a circular orbit above the Earth’s equator. It follows the Earth‘s rotating path so it orbits the Earth in time with its rotation. Thus it appears motionless up in the air remaining in the same spot above the ground. Communications and weather satellites often take geostationary orbits.
