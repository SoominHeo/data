Korean women’s volleyball team qualifies for London Olympics
The Korean women’s volleyball team is headed for the 2012 London Olympic Games after finishing second at the recently concluded 2012 FIVB Women‘s World Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tokyo, Japan.  Korea finished with a win-loss record of 5-2 at the eight-nation tournament and will return to the Olympics for the first time since the 2000 Sydney Games.  Star player Kim Yeon-Koung was dominant as usual, garnering three individual honors, including best scorer, best spiker and best receiver. 
 Eight nations participated in the qualification tournament to compete for the four remaining spots for volleyball at the 2012 London Games – host nation Japan, Korea, Thailand, Chinese Taipei, Russia, Serbia, Cuba, and Peru. The tournament employs the single round-robin competition system with each team playing once against each of other 7 teams. The top four teams qualify for the Olympics. Total points won and lost in every game are accumulated during the entire tournament to act as the tie-breaker in case teams finish with identical win-loss records.
 Korea got off to a good start on the first day by scoring a comprehensive 3-0 victory (25-19, 25-23, 25-20) over the once-mighty Cuba at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium. Kim Yeon-Koung and Hwang Youn-Joo led a balanced attack by scoring 16 points each. There were no upsets in the opening round of the tournament as co-favorites Russia, Serbia and Japan each scored 3-0 wins over their respective opponents. 
On day 2, Korea faced powerhouse Russia and suffered a not-unexpected 0-3 defeat (16-25, 23-25, 23-25) at the hands of one of the best teams in the world. Korea committed 20 errors during the match (compared to only 11 by Russia) and had great difficulty penetrating Russia’s superior blocking schemes. On the next day, Korea lost again, this time to Serbia in a four-set encounter (25-16, 21-25, 13-25, 20-25). Kim Yeon-Koung led all players with 30 points; however, she received little help from teammates as no other Korean player scored in double digits. 
Things looked bleak for Korea on the fourth day of competition as the team, with a win-loss record of 1-2, took on host Japan - the third ranked team in the world. A loss would have put Korea’s Olympic aspirations in serious jeopardy. In front of 10,000 raucous partisan fans, Kim Yeon-Koung put on a spectacular show. She scored a tournament-high 34 points to help Korea secure a much-needed victory in four action-pack sets (25-18, 22-25, 25-17, 25-13). She scored 31 of her points on 51 spike attempts, many of them jaw-dropping, thunderous smashes. Unlike the previous game, Kim Yeon-koung received plenty of support from teammates as Kim Hee-Jin and Han Song-Yi each contributed 13 points.
 After compiling a win-loss record of 2-2 through the first four days, Korea was poised to make a move in the standings against weaker opponents in the remaining matches. Next up was Chinese Taipei, and it was a complete mismatch. Korea cruised to an easy 3-0 victory (25-8, 25-12, 25-18) in a little over an hour. Kim Yeon-Koung played sparingly in the lop-sided match and barely broke a sweat while scoring 10 points. Korea enjoyed an overwhelming advantage in height and scored 18 points off blocks. 
On the sixth day of competition, Korea took on Thailand - the surprise winner of the 2009 Asian Women’s Volleyball Championship. Kim Yeon-Koung was once again dominant with a match high 23 points as Korea gained a hard-fought, but straight sets victory (25-18, 25-22, 25-20). The vastly improved Thailand applied a great deal of pressure on the Korean side throughout the match, but their efforts were all for naught as they committed 21 errors. One the last day, Korea brushed aside Peru in three straight sets (25-11, 25-18, 25-21) to finish the qualification tournament at 5-2, good for second place, and a place in London Olympics.
