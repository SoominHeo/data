Son Yeon-jae, South Korea’s proud rhythmic gymnast
Son Yeon-jae, an 18-year-old South Korean gymnast, was recently ranked the world’s fifth greatest rhythmic gymnast, Yonhap News reported.
 The International Gymnastics Federation, an international governing body of competitive gymnastics, in Lausanne, Switzerland put South Korea’s Son on the fifth spot in the global tally in her discipline, behind Russia’s Daria Kondakova, Daria Dmitrieva and Evgeniya Kanaeva, and Israel’s Neta Rivkin. Last year, Son was ranked 19th.
 The federation’s annual ranking is based on athletes’ participation rate and results at World Cup series. Son participated in four world cup events this year and received a total of 57 points. 
 Son secured her spot at the 2012 London Olympic Games at last year’s World Championships in Montpellier, France by finishing 11th among 24 competitors. Only top 15 gymnasts of each discipline can compete in the London Olympic Games and she became the second South Korean rhythmic gymnast to ever compete in the Olympics. 
 Son Yeon-jae was born on May, 28, 1994 in Seoul. She is a member of the South Korean national gymnastics team and belongs to the IB Sports agency. 
 Son is the first Korean Rhythmic Gymnast to win a medal in the World Cup series. 
 She won the bronze medal in the hoop final in Penza, Russia and earned the bronze medal in the 2010 Asian Games. She received another bronze medal at the Grand Prix series in Moscow, Russia on February 2012. 
 She is expected to take part in the Minsk world cup in July and is currently training in Russia for the 2012 London Olympic Games.
