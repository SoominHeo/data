Watching TV while driving to be punishable by law
The Korean government announced on June 7 that it would punish drivers who watch a dashboard-mounted television while they are driving with fines of up to 70,000 won. In-car wireless signals for mobile devices will also be mandatorily blocked by law when the vehicle is in motion.
 President Lee Myung-bak and government officials firmly asserted during an economic policy meeting that they have sketched out the plan to penalize drivers who exhibit this ill-mannered and life-threatening habit.
 The current law has prohibited such practice on paper but did not spell out any substantial penalties.
 The law was introduced two months after an accident that killed three professional athletes. On May 1, on a road in Uiseong County, southeastern Korea, a cargo truck driver who was watching TV mounted on his car, crashed into three professional cyclists, killing all three of them.
 The news of the tragic incident raised public awareness of the danger of watching these devices while driving.
 Koreans ignorantly use digital devices, such as TV, cell phones and MP3 players, while driving and it leads to a huge distraction to driving and eventually to horrific and irrevocable accidents.
 “Disaster prevention is necessary to protect lives and people’s attention to the issue should be raised to the level of advanced nations,” Lee was quoted as saying by his spokesman Park Jeong-ha during the meeting. “To become an advanced nation, people’s perception (of disaster prevention) should be changed first before revising laws.”
 About 15,000 people end up involved in car accidents here in Korea each year, leaving a heavy toll on the national economy as well.
