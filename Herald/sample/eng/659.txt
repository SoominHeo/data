NASDAQ apologizes for Facebook IPO
Technical issues at the NASDAQ stock exchange on the day Facebook went public on May 18 are set to cost the exchange operator a reported $40 million, if not more. 
The computer glitches created chaos when Facebook’s initial public offering (IPO) was delayed for around two hours, followed by “widespread confusion over whether trades had gotten through,” The Los Angeles Times reported. 
In response, Nasdaq has proposed a $40 million fund to repay brokerages that lost money during the incident, which has been met with widespread criticism.
 In addition to coming under attack for the debacle, NASDAQ is facing inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over what went wrong. 
“We continue to review the matter and have drawn no conclusions,” SEC spokesman John Nester said, declining to elaborate.
