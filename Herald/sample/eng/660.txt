Stony Brook University to teach undergrads in Songdo
Stony Brook University plans to open an undergraduate program at its Songdo campus in Korea, the Incheon Free Economic Zone Authority said.
 The application to open an undergraduate course for management of technology has been submitted to the South Korean Ministry of Education in April.
 Once the ministry approves, it will launch the new program starting March 2013, KBS reported.
 The school has been operating a graduate program for computer science and the management of technology at Songdo since March this year.
