China says Great Wall longer than previously thought
The Great Wall of China has been declared longer than previously estimated, China’s state-run media Xinhua news agency reported. 
 The wall’s actual length has been named at 21,196.18 km, more than twice the previous number of 8,850 km revealed in a 2009 study. The earlier number was mainly based on historical records. The latest estimate, however, was made on the basis of an archaeological survey that the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) has been conducted since 2007, added Xinhua.
 The Great Wall of China, the world’s longest and one of the most significant man-made structures, was built during the Qin dynasty between B.C. 221–206 by the China’s first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The purpose of the wall was to protect China’s northern border from its enemies and also for trade.
 The report added that only 8.2 percent of the original wall remains intact, with the rest in poor condition. Some parts have even collapsed.
 “To prevent the architectural wonder from further damage, the central government rolled out a set of rules on the protection of the Great Wall in 2006, establishing funding for protection, restoration and maintenance for the Great Wall, and banning commercial activities on the wall,” reported Xinhua.
 But many see China’s new measurement as problematic, saying it is not academically based and has political motives. In fact, the Korean government said it would closely watch to see if China’s new survey has distorted historical facts to include parts of Korea within the Great Wall area.
 The Great Wall of China was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.
