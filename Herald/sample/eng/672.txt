First stem cell vein implant successful on young girl
Swedish doctors reported recently that a 10-year-old girl has become the first person to successfully have a major blood vessel replaced with one that was made from her own stem cells. 
 The young patient had a rare condition where a major vein linking the intestines and the liver was blocked, which could cause serious health problems. Doctors were able to replace the blocked vein with one that was made from her stem cells. 
 The procedure “resulted not only in good blood flow rates and normal laboratory test values but also, in strikingly improved quality of life for the patient,” said the study, published in the medical journal The Lancet.
