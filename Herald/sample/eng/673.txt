Esprit value nosedives as top management quits
The value of Esprit Holdings Ltd. dropped 22 percent in Hong Kong on June 13 when news broke that the companyâ€™s chief executive officer and chairman quit within 24 hours of each other. 
 The Hong Kong-based fashion company announced that six months after its chief financial officer resigned, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Van der Vis quit on June 12 and Chairman Hans-Joachim Koerber quit just a day later. Esprit cited personal reasons for both exits. 
 Once ranked 28th out of the 100 most recognized brands in the U.S., the loss of top management has done little to help the company recover from a three-year profit decline, Bloomberg reported.
