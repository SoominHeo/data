Bodies of Peru Chopper crash victims return home
The bodies of eight South Koreans who were killed in a tragic helicopter crash in southern Peru arrived at Incheon International Airport on June 18.
 A chartered Korean Air plane carried the bodies from an international airport in Lima, the capital of Peru.
 The accident took the lives of all 14 people on board. The deceased were eight South Koreans, three Peruvians, one Dutchman, one Swede and one Czech. 
 The South Koreans were employees of Samsung C Korea Water Resources Corp.; Korea Engineering Consultants Corp.; and Seoyeong Engineering.
 They were reportedly on their way returning to Cusco from a trip to a potential site for a hydropower plant near Mazuco.
 The victims’ bodies were recovered after the wreckage of the aircraft was found on June 9 on Mount Mamarosa at about 4,950 meters above sea level, reported Yonhap News.
 Park Hee-kwon, South Korean Ambassador to Lima, said he was distressed by the many deaths caused by the helicopter crash. He also thanked the Peruvian government for its sincere help. 
 “The enthusiasm shown by Peru to support us in the aftermath of the crash was greater than that of an ally,” Park said.
 As the damage was so severe, Peruvian police identified victims by going over their dental records. Autopsies for the bodies were exempted according to Peruvian law, officials from the South Korean Embassy to Lima explained. 
 The cause of the crash in the Andes, according to officials there, is believed to be bad weather.
