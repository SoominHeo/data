Hong Kong‘s City University promotes Korean literary classics
City University of Hong Kong has completed compiling the Korean literary classics, university officials announced.
 Collaborating with South Korea’s Jeju National University, Kyungin Publishing Company and the University of California, Berkeley, it created an index for the Korean Anthology in History in literary Chinese.
 A collection of 3,000 volumes covers topics ranging from philosophy, history, literature, politics, society to economics, the military, geography and astronomy, from the 7th century to the 20th century.
 These books will be used to help look up works from a particular period in Korean history, such as the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) and the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), the university said.
