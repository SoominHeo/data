Korea, Mexico resume FTA negotiations
President Lee Myung-bak and his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon met on June 17 in the G20 summit held in Mexico to reopen negotiations on the two countries’ bilateral talks.
 The two countries started free trade negotiations in 2007, but they hit a snag in 2008.
 Back then, Mexico expressed concerns that the agreement would raise Mexico’s trade deficit with Korea.
 In the meeting on June 17, the Mexican president agreed to Lee’s suggestion to restart trade talks.
 Calderon said in particular that Korea and Mexico have much to benefit from free trade, according to Lee’s spokesman Park Jeong-ha.
 At the meeting, Calderon also accepted Lee’s invitation to Korea and the Mexican president is scheduled to visit Seoul in the near future.
 Before the two presidents’ meeting, both countries foreign ministers met head to head and inked an agreement to boost the two countries’ cooperation in nuclear energy development.
 Lee and Calderon expressed satisfaction with their countries’ ties since they established diplomatic relations 50 years ago.
 Korea now has free trade agreements with 45 partners countries the United States and the members of the European Union.
 Lee has sought free trade agreements with other nations in a passionate manner with firm belief that such arrangements will enlarge Korea’s economic territory.
 Meanwhile, the Korean President will embark on a trip to Latin American nations following the G20 summit, said the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae.
 Lee was scheduled to visit Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, to attend the U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development -- also dubbed Rio+20 -- from June 20 to 21, and then make an official visit to Chile from June 21 to 23. Then he will tour Colombia from June 23 to 25 in the first ever visit by a Korean head of state to South American nation.
