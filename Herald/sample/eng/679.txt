‘Harmful’ on-line ads increase exponentially
The number of Internet news outlets that contained harmful advertisements on their portals and websites has tripled this year from a year before, a ministry report showed on June 11.
 Of a total of 3,216 news media websites that have registered with the government, 176 or 5.5 percent were found to display “harmful” ads, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family from March 7 to May 21stated.
 In a similar survey last year, 62 out of 2,438 registered sites were revealed to carry lewd advertisements.
 In this year’s survey, one news website was caught posting adult content ads on its site with no protective measures for children, which is a violation of the law, the ministry said.
 The legions of obnoxious ads ranged from dietary supplements to plastic surgery. The former made up 15.6 percent of the overall malign ads and the latter accounted for 6.8 percent. 
 The ministry has promised that it would push harsher measures on online news outlets by introducing a strict ad-reviewing system.
 South Korea boasts one of the highest Internet penetration rates in the world. Over 90 percent of the population has access to the Internet and since 2008 more than three-quarters of news has been transmitted online domestically.
