Park Chu-young embroiled in military duty controversy
Park Chu-young is a 27-year-old footballer who once played as the captain of the South Korea’s national soccer team. He scored 24 goals in 58 matches when playing for FC Seoul in Korea. Today, he plays for Arsenal, in the English Premier League. 
 Recently, Park held a rare press conference in Seoul’s Korea Football Association headquarters and apologized to his fans about the controversy regarding his military service.
 At the conference, he said he had never thought of evading his military duty and regretted that he had missed an opportunity to clarify his position.
 Insisting that he has no intention of immigrating to Monaco to dodge his military obligation, Park told reporters that his decision to take the residency card from Monaco was purely based on the understanding that it would benefit his career as a soccer player.
 “I am sorry that there has been lot of controversy regarding my military duty and I will surely complete my military service,” said Park.
 Park played for AS Monaco from 2008 to 2011 and received a 10-year residency status from Monaco. 
 The news of him postponing his military service until age 37 and that he will eventually earn permission to skip his military service, disappointed many local fans.
 Park will play for the Korean national soccer team in 2012 London Olympic this summer. Under the Korean conscription law, male athletes who get a medal in the Olympics can waive their military duty. 
 Still, Park claimed, “I am not thinking about a medal, but about playing harder with my teammates and performing well in the Olympics.”
