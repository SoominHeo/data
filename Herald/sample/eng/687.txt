Taxi drivers strike to demand more government support
Hundreds of thousands of taxi drivers staged a one-day rally at Seoul Plaza on June 20, demanding the government stabilize LPG prices, give more fuel subsidies and raise cab fares.
 According to Yonhap News, about 255,000 or 80 percent of taxi drivers from four taxi driver associations in the nation took part in the massive strike. Taxi services were halted for the day with only about 8,000 taxis -- or 16 percent of the total -- operating in the city area.
 To buffer the strike’s impact on commuters, the Seoul Metropolitan Government extended bus, subway and train services by one hour. Bus operations were scaled up to 998 round trips for the day and the number of subway services per line was increased to 255. Passengers were also encouraged to share rides in cabs and people at airports and train stations were also informed of the strike.
 The remaining taxi drivers who chose not to participate in the protest went on with their businesses, regardless of their set shifts. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs cautioned demonstrators that it would take harsh measures if they interfere with other drivers’ operations. 
 The majority of taxis in Korea use LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) as an alternative fuel and the taxi union argued that the retail price of LPG had jumped more than 50 percent over the past three years.
 They warned the government that if their demands were not met, they will hold another strike in October or December.
