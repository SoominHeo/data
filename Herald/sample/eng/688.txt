Disney pledges to stop junk-food ads on its channels
Media and entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. announced on June 6 that it would ban junk-food advertisements on its broadcasting channels, joining the nationwide fight against childhood obesity, Reuters reported.
 The ban will be broadly applied to the company’s television, radio and online programs for children under age 12, the company said. The latest move was welcomed by first lady Michelle Obama and other health advocates in the United States. 
 The emphasis of promoting healthy eating habits among children is nothing new. New York City has stopped sales of certain high-calorie, low-nutrition foods, such as jumbo-sized sugary drinks in the city. The U.S. government forecast the measure will help fight against childhood obesity in the nation.
 Nearly one-third of kids in the U.S. are reportedly overweight or obese and now there are more children with Type 2 diabetes, a disease thought to be that of adults.
 A 2006 Institute of Medicine report showed that junk food marketing has played a significant role in raising the obesity problem at early ages. Fast-food restaurants, such as McDonald’s Corp. have given out free toys to attract younger customers to buy its “Happy Meals.” 
 Disney also talked about putting “Mickey Check” labels on healthy foods in grocery stores across the nation to help children make wise food choices. 
 It is the first time “a major media company is admitting they have responsibility for children,” said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
 “The announcement is a game changer as it puts Disney ahead of the pack of media outlets.”
 Yet, the effects of its efforts to cure America’s malady of child obesity remain to be seen, said Reuters, amid criticism that it will do little to shift U.S. children’s eating habits.
