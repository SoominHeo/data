Tortoise returns home after short break
A 44-year-old tortoise which went missing was found a week later in the United States, the Chicago Tribune said.
 The tortoise, named Lance, was found on June 24 hanging out in a pool in St. Charles, III, but its home was actually in Chicago.
 During the missing period, Lance was taken care of by a 10-year-old girl who lives close to the pool.
 A neighbor of the girl contacted Lanceâ€™s owners after media reports about the missing tortoise.
