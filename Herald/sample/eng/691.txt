Egypt elects new President
Mohammed Morsi won the Presidential election on June 24 in Egypt.
 The election this time was the first-ever democratic presidential election in the country.
 Morsi supporters set off fireworks and released doves right after they heard the outcome.
 “I pledge to be a president who serves his people and works for them,” Morsi said on his official Web page.
 He also said he would not betray God in defending people’s rights and the rights of the nation.
