Closer look at Japan's economic decline
The British weekly of Economist said in April that Korea would surpass Japan in terms of national wealth, quoting a report by the International Monetary Fund.
 The Economist went on to say that Japan was losing much of its economic momentum, such as in purchasing power and GDP.
 For example, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan surpassed Japan in terms of per capita GDP, adjusting for the cost of living, in 1993, 1997 and 2010, respectively.
 Korea was forecast by the Economist to overtake Japan in annual per capita income by reaching $40,000. Korea’s per capita GDP was a quarter of Japan’s in the 1980s.
 The global economy in general is in a bad condition, but that of Japan is much more serious. International financial agencies are downgrading Japan’s credit ratings, and the country‘s trade balance is also nose-diving.
 Japan’s trade deficit in April, for example, was six times as large as that in March, and the country recorded trade deficit of 2.4 trillion yen in 2011.
 Japan had not recorded annual trade deficit 31 years before it did in 2011.
 Japan recorded economic growth of 4.1 percent in the first quarter this year, but experts warn that the recovery will be temporary.
 The country’s larger trade deficit than before is due to its weak exports. Japan’s exports in April rose 7.9 percent from the previous year, but they were far below the expected growth rate of 11.8 percent. However, Japan‘s imports have risen as much as 8 percent from the previous year.
 Experts point out that Japan’s biggest economic problems lie in poor financial stability. In 2011, Japan‘s debt ratio was the highest in the Group of Seven major economies.
 They warn the worsening economic conditions in Europe will continue to deal a heavy blow to Japan’s economy for years to come.
