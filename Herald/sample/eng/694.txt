Under sea shape - could it be a UFO?
Alien enthusiasts claim to have found an unidentified flying object found in an unusual place.
 The object, estimated to be 30 meters in diameter was spotted in mid June under the Baltic Sea off the coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula.
 When the discus-shaped object was first spotted, many thought it looked just like the Millennim Falcon, a spacecraft in the movie Star Wars.
 As to the assumption, a Swedish probe team explained that their initial conclusion was that it was a large rock or deep-sea cliff.
 Many believers in aliens think the object might be a crashed flying saucer, but others say it is just a strange anomaly.
 The investigation team said it had no intention to pursue further investigation after publicizing the finding, possibly due to a wide variety of arguments on what the subject really is and whether it is worth further study.
 More on UFOs
 The term UFO technically refers to any unidentified flying object. Proponents of alien life argue that they appear to be technological and not natural phenomena and that they must not be from Earth. UFO sightings have occurred throughout history, but modern interest in them dates from World War II. In the 1940s, the term “flying saucer” was coined, since when governments worldwide have investigated reports of UFOs.
 Meanwhile, most investigators so far have acknowledged that between 5 percent and 20 percent of reported UFO sightings remain unexplained, and therefore can be classified as “unidentified.”
 While UFOs have been the subject of extensive investigation by various governments and organizations, few scientific journals have been published on UFOs. There has also been debate in the scientific community about whether any scientific investigation into UFOs is really valuable.
