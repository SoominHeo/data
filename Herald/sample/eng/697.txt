The world of K-pop from the eyes of its stars
On June 23, SM Entertainment released a documentary tracing the history of its K-pop stars from their auditions to the wildly successful concert at Madison Square Garden in October 2011. “I AM” features never-before-seen behind-the-scenes footage of the SM Town stars. 
The documentary film shows the hardships endured by the K-pop stars leading up to their highly successful “SM Town Live ’10 World Tour.” It focuses on the landmark finale concert, held at the world-class Madison Square Garden concert hall on Oct. 23 last year. 
The story looks back on the struggles and sacrifice faced by the 32 SM Town artists that performed at the Madison Square Garden. In particular, the intense pressures under which they -- once very young trainees -- spent years in studios practicing dance moves and polishing their vocal skills so that they could one day become what they are now; global superstars. 
A major theme throughout “I AM” was the loss of childhood for the sake of achieving their dreams. Taeyeon of Girls’ Generation, for example, openly discussed her struggles with identity during her trainee days, which was made more difficult by the sudden jump from awkward teen to instant superstar. 
This film features a variety of moments wherein fans are able to catch a rare glimpse of their superstar idols as fellow people, humanizing them. It is a great film to watch, especially for those interested in what it is like to be a K-pop superstar. Though their lives may seem glamorous and carefree, this documentary shows that the road of achieving your dreams is filled with hardships and compromise. 
“I AM” is available for viewing in select theaters across Korea. For more information, visit http://www.iam2012.co.kr
