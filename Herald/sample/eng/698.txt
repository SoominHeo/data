Egypt’s Mubarak in critical condition
Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is close to dying, Egypt’s state news agency MENA reported. 
 The report said that Mubarak suffered from a stroke in prison and was transferred to the Maadi military hospital in Cairo; he has since been put on life support.
 A small group of people -- supporters and opponents alike -- were gathered outside the building, fretting over the development of his condition.
 The 84-year-old former Egyptian president ruled the country for nearly three decades until the Egyptian revolution broke out in 2011. Frustrated over his dictatorship and longing for a transition into democracy, people of Egypt protested for 18 days during the revolution. By the power of the people, Mubarak was ousted about 16 months ago. 
 However, after resigning as president, allegations of corruption and abuse of power surfaced for the former leader, including the killing of innocent protestors. He stood trial on Aug. 3, 2011. In June this year, Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison by an Egyptian court. 
 The recent presidential election in Egypt has put the country in chaos. Tens and thousands of people rallied in Cairo’s Tahrir Square claiming the election result was rigged by its military forces. In the end, Mohammed Morsi from the Muslim Brotherhood was named the new leader of the country. Morsi called for national unity. 
 Hosni Mubarak was born on May 4, 1928 and he served as the fourth president of Egypt from 1981 to 2011. He was one of Egypt’s longest-serving rulers. He has a wife, Suzanne Mubarak and two children, Alaa and Gamal Mubarak.
