Jeju Island, ‘The Hawaii of Korea’
Jeju Island, a pride and joy of Koreans everywhere, has been chosen as the number one preferred summer holiday hotspot in Korea by Chinese tourists, the Korea Tourism Organization reported on June 12. 
The poll was conduced on Weibo, a Chinese equivalent to Twitter. 1,148 people participated in the poll, which lasted from May 10 to 24. 374 people picked Jeju Island as the place they would most like to vacation, putting it at No. 1. Seoul and Busan came in second and third, respectively. 
It is unsurprising that Jeju Island would be a popular destination for tourists during the summer. Not only has the volcanic island been recently named one of the “New 7 Wonders of Nature,” it is also home to some exciting tourist destinations that appeal to both Koreans and foreigners alike. 
Glass Castle 
The Glass Castle in Jeju Island is perhaps one of the most interesting theme parks you could possibly visit. Not only can you experience the beauty and wonder of glass sculptures in both the indoor and outdoor sections, but you can also try your hand at making your own glass product as well. 
Gimnyeong Maze Park
 There are several maze parks found in Jeju Island. The Gimnyeong Maze Park is a great option for both children and adults looking to experience the adventure of finding your way through an outdoor maze. The Gimnyeong Maze Park is unique in that it contains foliage from all over Asia. Located between the Manjanggul Cave and Gimnyeongsagul Cave, it is a perfect spot to pop in with family or friends. 
Samyang Beach
 Even with the abundance of beautiful beaches available in Jeju Island, the distinctive Samyang Beach is worth checking out. Despite being one of the less explored beaches on the island, it features crystal clear waters and unique sparkling black sand.
