Places designated for near-extinct marine mammals
Marine mammals such as sea otters and blue whales, which are often featured in various animation pictures, are beloved by children and adults alike.
 South American researchers recently named 20 important sites where they think such mammals’ protection is crucial, according to AP news.
 Ocean mammals are widely distributed, but 11 of the conservation sites are home to creatures that are found nowhere else, AP quoted Sandra Pompa, a researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, as saying.
 Those sites are the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos Islands, Amazon River, San Felix and Juan Fernandez Islands, Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal in Russia, the Yangtze River, Indus River, Ganges River and the Kerguelen Island in the southern Indian Ocean.
 The research findings revealed that the 11 sites represent critical areas of conservation value at a global level and can serve as the first step for adopting global strategies with geographic conservation targets. 
Pompa explained that the nine other sites include 84 percent of all species of marine mammal.
 The nine regions are along the costs of Baja California, much of the eastern coast of the Americas, Peru, Argentina, Northwestern Africa, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
 The findings were published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Pompa expected the research results to become a valuable conservation tool for organizations and governments that seek to protect endangered species, AP said.
 The researchers at the university explained that the Caribbean monk seal, Atlantic gray whale and Steller’s sea cow became extinct owing to hunting for fur, blubber and meat.
 Most recently, the baiji, a type of porpoise from the Yangtze River, was declared extinct, they added.
