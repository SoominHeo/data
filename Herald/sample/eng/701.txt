Korea to stop oil imports from Iran
Due to sanctions imposed by the European Union and United States, the Korean government has decided to end Iranian oil imports, says Yonhap News.
 The government said that imports of Iranian oil will be suspended from July 1 as a EU insurance ban will begin on vessels carrying Iranian oil. Officials from Korea’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy confirmed that with the latest insurance ban, Korea is not in a position to continue importing from Tehran.
 Korea is Asia’s fourth-largest economy and one of the biggest buyers of Iranian oil in the world. As the import ban will reduce Korea’s oil supply, the Korean government has been in continuous dialogue with other nations to secure alternative sources of oil. 
 It has already replaced most of its supply with oil from other producers, including Kuwait, Iraq and Qatar, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said. “Korea will continue its efforts to help minimize the impact on the country‘s economy and businesses.” 
 Korea is the first major Asian economy to join the global efforts to push Iran to give up its nuclear program. The global community sees the measure as a significant blow to the Middle Eastern nation, as oil is its major source of revenue.
Oil-carrying vessels are insured to prepare for possible accidents, such as environmental disasters. Most companies that sell this kind of insurance are in the EU. So when the insurance embargo came into place on July 1, shipping companies worldwide could not insure vessels carrying Iranian crude. 
 Following the announcement, other oil importing nations in Asia, such as India and China have asked Tehran to directly arrange shipments and insurance for its exports to their territories.
