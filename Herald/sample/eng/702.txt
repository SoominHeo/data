Seoul‘s city hall to turn into library
The old City Hall in Seoul will be reborn as a public library, the city government said on June 28. It is a part of the city’s cultural promotion projects.
 The building was built in 1926 during the Japanese colonial rule.
 The renovation of the building, tentatively named “Seoul Library,” began in 2009. The library is slated to open this September. 
The new library is a five-story building with four underground floors. It will carry 200,000 books, diverse audiovisual materials, digital data and Braille books. "We will try to expand the volumes in the library while actively promoting it for public service and convenience," said a city official.
