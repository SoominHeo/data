Fossilized dinosaur nest becomes natural monument
The fossilized nest of a theropod dinosaur found on Aphae Island off Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, has been named a natural monument, the Cultural Heritage Administration announced on June 27.
 The discovery of the three-ton nest was made in September 2009. It carried fossils of 19 dinosaur eggs, which belong to the primarily carnivorous suborder theropoda. 
 Scientists think the discovery will be valuable to the study of the carnivorous dinosaurs that existed 80 million to 90 million years ago on the Korean Peninsula.
