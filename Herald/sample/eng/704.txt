Big Ben gets new name: Elizabeth Tower
London’s Big Ben clock tower will be renamed “Elizabeth Tower” to honor the 60-year service of the country’s queen, Reuters reported on June 26.
 The announcement was made just a few days after the celebrations of 86-year-old Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee. The jubilee celebrations were embellished with star-studded concerts, a mark of the Queen’s increased popularity in recent years, said the report.
 The changing of the tower’s name was proposed by Conservative Party lawmaker Tobias Ellwood and was welcomed by a parliamentary commission.
 Prime Minister David Cameron also welcomed the idea. “The renaming of the Clock Tower to the Elizabeth Tower is a fitting recognition of the Queen’s 60 years of service. This is an exceptional tribute to an exceptional monarch,” he said. 
However, the change did not sit well with some; they argued the Big Ben is an iconic landmark of the city and people in the world will not be able to recognize the tower with its new name. A last month’s YouGov survey found almost half the population opposed the idea with just 30 percent supporting it. 
 Officially called the Clock Tower, it has been better known as Big Ben, after the name of the bell it contains. The 315-feet-high neo-Gothic tower was built in 1859 on the bank of the River Thames in the heart of London’s Whitehall government district. It is a part of Britain’s Houses of Parliament. There are 393 steps which lead to the top of the tower.
