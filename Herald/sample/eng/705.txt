World’s largest crocodile found
Guinness World Records said on July 1 that the largest crocodile currently in captivity is in the Philippines.
 The giant crocodile named “Lolong” was caught in Bunawan town, southern Philippines, in September 2011.
 It measures over 6 meters and weights more than a ton. People in Bunawan are both happy and worried with largest crocodiles in their town.
 Bunawan Mayor said in an AP interview that the villagers were proud of the region’s rich biodiversity. He added that they were also very much concerned that there would be many more crocodiles like Lolong in their town.
