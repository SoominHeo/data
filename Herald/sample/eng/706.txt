New Hong Kong leader takes office
Hong Kong’s new leader Leung Chun-ying was sworn in on July 1, backed by the Chinese government.
 The new leader took office in a ceremony overseen by Chinese President Hu Jintao.
 Leung became Hong Kong’s third chief executive since the United Kingdom ended its colonial rule and China regained control.
 Leung, a 57-year-old self-made millionaire, replaces career bureaucrat Donald Tsang who took office in 2005.
