Women to outnumber men in Korea by 2050
The number of women will be larger than that of men from 2015, a government report said on July 1.
 The report came a week after the news that Korean population surpassed the 50-million mark.
 The July 1 report by Statistics Korea explained that the increasing number of women was largely due to women’s higher life expectancy.
 The number of women in Korea in 2015 will mark 25.31 million while that of men will be 25.30 million, said the report.
 In the past, men have outnumbered women because of a preferences for boys.
 The statistics showed that the number of women in the country would continue to outnumber that of men and reach 26.2 million by 2031. It further showed that the number of men would decline after peaking at 25.9 million in 2029.
 In 2010, the average life expectancy of women was 84.1 years, while that of men was 77.2.
 Researches show that Korean women are one of the best educated in the world, but social scientists in the country argue that the women’s participation in economic activity lags behind those in advanced countries.
 According to the data, the proportion of Korean high school girls entering university jumped from 31.9 percent in 1990 to 80.5 percent in 2010, compared with 73 percent in the U.S., 70 percent in Sweden and 60 percent in the U.K.
 Over the same period, however, the ratio of Korean women engaged in economic activity increased by a mere 4.6 percent to 54.5 percent, far below 76 percent in Sweden, 70 percent in the U.K. and 69 percent in the U.S.
