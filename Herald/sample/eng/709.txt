Students practice surgery on screen
You might know about the mannequins that lie on operating tables for medical students to carry out mock surgery, but you may have never thought of them learning using a digital screen showing an anatomical chart that looks more real than the inside of a human body.
 The digital cadaver can be enlarged, reduced and turned upside down. You can control whether it has just bones or a full skeleton, muscles and intestines, with a few touches of the screen. It can even change gender -- from man to woman and vice versa
 This is possible at an operating room in Stanford University’s medical school. According to news reports, more than 70 percent of the students at the school said the digital cadaver was useful in their anatomy class.
 The digital body, embedded in the “Anatomage Table,” was created by Anatomage CEO Jack Choi. Anatomage is a U.S. firm specializing in 3-D medical technology, and Choi whose first name is Won-cheol is a Korean-American engineer.
 Choi, 44, graduate of mechanical engineering department of Seoul National University earned his master’s and doctor’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States. He studied computer-assisted design at the university.
 Choi’s father was the first director of Busan Paik Hospital and three brothers of Choi are also doctors in Korea and the United States.
 An official at Anatomage explains that an increasing number of medical schools worldwide are placing orders for digital corpses.
 Many of those orders are from the countries that forbid autopsies for religious reasons, such as those in the Middle East.
 An Anatomage table costs around $60,000, and Choi expressed hope in a medical conference held in Long Beach, California, early this year that the problems of “cadaver shortages” can be solved with his invention.
