 Moments when two became one
 After the Korean war and the division of a once united nation, the two countries that resulted, North and South, have never been on good terms. Tensions increase from time to time as one nation makes a dangerous or risky move, sometimes as a reminder of their existence. With opposing political views and beliefs, the two nations have grown wary and perhaps even a have bitter feelings of hatred toward one another. Despite all these bitter feelings, I decided to volunteer and help children refugees from North Korea experience a cultural and social environment in a water park at Ttukseom Resort through the CGL (Culture, Game Leisure) program that is part of a youth voluntary group called VOMY,.
 When I first met the children it was a bit awkward. I didn’t know them, and they obviously didn’t know me, either. But my job was to spend a memorable time with them, one that they can keep and remember. My partner was an 11-year-old boy named Yang Ja-oh.
 At first I thought communication with them was going to be a problem, but actually the problem proved to be a benefit. Since we couldn’t talk, we were able to communicate through feelings. Instead of pulling us apart it drew us closer together. As we ate, played, swam, joked, pushed, scared, surprised and talked with each other, I became very close to Ja-oh. I was astonished how quickly we got to know each other . Although our countries share the same bitterness for each other, at a smaller, individual scale, we can all be friends. The relationship that Ja-oh and I built up during that short period of time was a small representation of a united, unified Korea and united Koreans.
