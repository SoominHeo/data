Return of the Spice Girls
The Spice Girls have reunited to release "Viva Forever!" a new West End musical based on their hit songs, said BBC Entertainment News.
 Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Halliwell attended a press conference at a central London hotel on June 26 to announce the show. 
 “We’re going to be introducing a whole new generation to Girl Power,” said Victoria Beckham, now better known as the wife of English soccer legend David Beckham. 
 With their debut single “Wannabe,” the Spice Girls topped the charts in 31 countries in 1996 and sold more than 75 million albums worldwide. But the group disbanded in 2000. In 2007, the group was reformed for a reunion tour.
 The show, “Viva Forever!,” was written by Jennifer Saunders and produced by Judy Craymer from the Abba musical "Mamma Mia!" It will be directed by Paul Garrington, who has staged international productions of "Mamma Mia!" and "Dirty Dancing."
 The musical tries to unveil the little details of the “bitter reality of fame,” in the entertainment business. With that, the show depicts women’s anxieties, the fear of judgment from the public and how these things could ruin their personal relationships, the show’s producer Craymer explained. 
 “It is the story of a beautiful, talented girl and her best friends who get swept up in the obsession of today’s TV celebrity culture.”
 "Viva Forever!" is a jukebox musical -- one that uses previously released popular songs as its musical composition. Jukebox musicals often have plots based on the biography and music of the performers. Lately, this type of musicals have achieved great success, particularly "Mamma Mia!," through which the music of ABBA was appreciated by many from the world over. 
 The musical "Viva Forever!" hits London’s Piccadilly Theatre on Dec. 11.
