Discover the beauty of Persian culture in Iran
Known as Persia until 1935, Iran is best known for being the site of numerous battles with the West rather than being home to one of the world’s oldest civilizations. Instead of earning respect for its historical value, Iran has spent the past few decades in a power struggle with the West that has left it with a serious image problem. 
Beyond the stereotype of being labeled a terrorist nation, however, lie remnants of ancient civilizations, magnificent palaces and a culture of misunderstood people. Since the initial arrival of humans to the area, Iran has become home to its own unique melting pot of ethnically diverse people. 
To get a better understanding of Iranian culture, you must venture outside the capital city of Tehran. Isfahan, for example, features stunning architecture, tree-lined boulevards and exciting bazaars that one would expect from the former capital city. 
Tabriz on the other hand, is the provincial capital of Western Iran with a long history that has been shrouded in mystery and legend. Some believe that the city is the site of the Biblical “Garden of Eden.” Just beyond Tabriz sits the tourist village of Kandovan. It is a village known for its scenic beauty and popularized due to its fascinating troglodyte dwellings. 
Another place worth a visit is Persepolis, near the modern City of Shiraz. Another former capital of Iran, it holds a treasure trove of Persian culture. The ruins found around Persepolis show a vast city-like complex that was built more than 2,500 years ago. Today, it acts as a symbol of Iranian nationality. 
 Humans have inhabited the area now known as Iran since the Stone Age. In fact, ancient Persians are thought to have arrived in about 1500 B.C.
