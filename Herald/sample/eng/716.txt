Japan moves to strengthen military
The Japanese government recently expressed its ambition to expand military operations, and the neighboring countries including Korea showed signs of discomfort.
 According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, the country’s Prime Ministerial Committee released a report on July 5 and said that Japan should be allowed to exercise rights of collective defense.
 The Korean government said in response that it was keeping a close eye on Japan’s move which is aimed at scrapping a ban on collective self-defense.
 In theory, Japan is not supposed to be involved in any military conflicts according to its constitution.
 The so-called “Peace Constitution” of Japan, which is also known as “Postwar Constitution,” stipulates that the country’s land, sea, and air forces will never be maintained. The constitution was enacted in 1947 after the end of the World War II.
 However, Japan has been trying to beef up its military forces slowly and steadily.
 In 2010, Japan revised self-defense regulations to give its Self-Defense Forces greater mobility. In 2011, the Japanese government eased regulations regarding exports of defense equipment. In June this year, Japan’s atomic laws were revised in a way that was considered by critics as opening the way for Japan to arm itself with nuclear weapons. 
The Japanese government report caused concerns in Korea as it raised the possibility of Japan deploying its troops in South Korea in the event of North Korean aggression against the South.
 Meanwhile, some Japanese politicians are also calling on its government to end any military ambitions amid intensifying territorial conflicts between Japan and China.
