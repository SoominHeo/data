Zoo wants orangutan to quit smoking
An Indonesian zoo’s orangutan may be moved to a small island to help her quit smoking, according to news reports.
 The Center for Orangutan Protection at Taru Jurug Zoo said getting the orangutan to quit smoking has been difficult due to zoo visitors throwing cigarettes into her cage.
 Zoo officials said they have tried to curb the orangutan’s habit, which she learned from watching zoo visitors.
 “Animal keepers have warned the visitors several times, but they keep on giving her cigarettes, as the animal keepers are not watching them all the time,” said the officials.
