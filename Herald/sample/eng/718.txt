Korean alphabet may have existed before Joseon
The Korean alphabet, Hangeul, was being used about 3,000 years ago, well before the 15th century when King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty created it, claims one Korean scholar.
 In his book titled “Money,” Lee Chan-gu, a Korean scholar who studies a Chinese classic book on divination, argues that two Korean letters were discovered on stone inscriptions of knife-shaped ancient Chinese metal money. The inscription appeared in the 19th century book of ancient Chinese currencies. 
 According to Lee, this knife-shaped money was made in the Liaoxi area, northeastern China, about 3,600 years ago. It was used during the middle or latter years of the Spring and Autumn Period (B.C. 770-476) in China. 
 One of the letters was “don,” meaning money in Korean, he explained. A 1446 Chinese language document also briefly dealt with the existence of a new Korean writing system.
 Taking into account a passage in the preface of Hunminjeongeum, where King Sejong mentioned that “Hangeul is an imitation of ancient Korean characters,” he raised a possibility that there had already been existed Korean letters used by King Sejong’s forefathers. 
 Mindful of public criticism, Lee made sure that he did not intend to discredit the king’s accomplishment of inventing of the Korean alphabet, Hangeul. Rather, he said he felt responsible “to prove that Hangeul derived from the restoration or imitation of ancient Korean letters,” for example, Mongolian.
