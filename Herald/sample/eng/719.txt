Facebook, Yahoo shake hands after dispute
Facebook and Yahoo agreed to settle a dispute to avoid further battles on July 6, according to AP.
 Finishing the dispute, the two companies agreed to license their patents to each other.
 They also agreed to an advertising alliance that expands their existing partnership. 
The advertising alliance could help Yahoo recover some of the revenue it has lost as people invested more money in Facebookâ€™s online social network.
