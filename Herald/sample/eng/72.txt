 We were not very much different
 It was my first time meeting children from North Korea, so I was really concerned about what could I do for them. When I met them, I realized that they are no different from us. They were just young and cute children.
 My partner was a boy called Hae-san. When I saw him, he had a sullen face. Even when I spoke to him it was hard to make him talk. Because he didn’t say anything, I had to get his name from other children. I was ashamed because I didn’t know what he wanted and so I could not do anything for him. While other children were playing with their partners (other volunteers), I was just sitting and waiting for him to play with me. Although he didn’t seem to want to play, but I didn’t give up and I continued to try to get him have fun with me in the pool.
 In the end, he smiled and I could hold his hand. Even though he didn’t say anything from beginning to end, I was really glad to see smile on his face. It was so touching. I want to thank Hae-san for showing me his smile and teaching me what real volunteering is. Thanks a lot, and that I’ll see him next time.
 Also, I want to tell people that many North Koreans flee for their freedom, but that the society is not really interested. They need much help from us because they have financial troubles and difficulty adapting to a new environment. We need to pay more attention to our North Korean brethren.
