Korean marathoners from 1948 Olympics revisit London
Two former marathoners from Korea who participated in the 1948 London Olympics will return to London this summer for this year’s Olympics, the Korean Olympic Committee said.
 To support their junior athletes, Choi Yun-chil, 83, and Ham Kee-yong, 82, will watch the marathon and visit the Korean athletes’ village in London. 
 In 1948, South Korea sent 52 athletes in seven sport categories. It was recently reported that only four of those athletes are still alive.
