Girls’ Generation stamps released
K-pop group Girls’ Generation will be featured on postage stamps, said S.M. Entertainment.
 Marking its 5th anniversary, the group will appear on postage stamps issued by Korea Post, becoming the first Korean entertainers to do so.
 The postage stamp set consists of 14 stamps, is priced at 20,000 won, and will go on sale in early August.
 “We expect the Girls’ Generation stamps will greatly contribute to developing the culture of postal stamps,” said Kim Tae-wan, an official at Korea Post.
