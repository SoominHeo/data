La belleza de Espana
Despite the looming threat of a full-scale bailout, Spain has long been known to be home to one of the world’s richest histories, beautiful cultures, passionate people, and not to mention, the winners of Euro 2012. Whether you are looking for great beaches, exciting adventures or historically significant cities, Spain makes a great destination for families and friends alike. 
The capital city of Madrid has an abundance of art and culture that is enough to inspire even the least creative. The architecture reflects the cultural motto of living in the moment. The people are warm and welcoming in a city that is full of life and high culture. There is more to explore in this great city than just being the home of Real Madrid football club.
 Just up the road from Madrid sits another well-known city with an equally famous football team: Barcelona. Unlike the relaxed lifestyle of Madrid, Barcelona can be described as the most cosmopolitan city of Spain. Housing one of the busiest ports on the Mediterranean Sea, there is a distinct multicultural feel to the area. In fact, Barcelona is the capital of the Catalonia region; a region with its own distinct language, character and history.
 The city of Granada, on the other hand, offers visitors a vastly different experience. Located in Southern Spain, Granada entrances visitors with its Alhambra and mysterious winding streets of the Albayzín. The Alhambra is a magnificent palace and fortress complex built in the 14th century; during the end of Muslim rule of Spain. The Albayzín refers to a district of Granada that has retained the narrow winding streets of its Medieval Moorish past. Both have been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
 Spain has the second-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the largest number of World Heritage Cities. 
 Many Catalans think of their home as a separate country.
