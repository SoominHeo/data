Super Junior releases sixth album
In about a year since their last album, “Mr. Simple,” boy band Super Junior released their sixth album, titled, “Sexy, Free & Single.” 
 “We have prepared a lot, as we did for the fifth album, to show as many things as possible,” said the group’s leader, Lee-teuk during a comeback news conference in Seoul. He said that the group tried to make a fruitful, fun and exciting comeback.
 “We have received plenty of love and help since debuting in 2005,” Lee stated. “We want to grow into an idol group that wins the hearts of all age groups ranging from teens to those in their 60s and 70s.”
 The latest album has 10 songs. The title song, “Sexy, Free & Single” is a dance song with a little bit of R&B vibe added to it. “The songs from the sixth album represent our own stories; about men who have succeeded through their hard work,” the group told reporters at the press conference.
 Super Junior debuted with their sixth album, “Sexy, Free & Single,” on cable music channel Mnet on July 5. 
 The 13 member pop idol group has enjoyed unprecedented fame, thanks to the success of their fifth album, “Mr. Simple.” 
 “Mr. Simple,” released last December, sold more than 500,000 copies in the domestic market. The group went on a world concert tour called “Super Show 4” and attracted 400,000 people in 10 cities across the world.
