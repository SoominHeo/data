Demonstration of anti-Korean wave in Japan
On Aug. 21, there was a big demonstration against the Korean wave in Tokyo. It was the second such protest following one on Aug. 7. More than 6,000 people participated in it, and they maintained that they were opposed to preponderance of Korean wave in Fuji TV programs.　
 This unfavorable impression, anti-Korean wave, has been around since the Fuji TV arranged Korean programs over 40 hours a week. Also, recently this ill feeling spreads widely as the dismissal of Takaoka Sousuke, a Japanese actor, from his agency because of his comments against the Korean Wave.
 According to the J-CAST, a Japanese internet medium, there were various people, from middle school students to a woman with her children carrying the national flag of Japan, taking part in the demonstration. This was not an illegal display, but a formal demonstration allowed by the National Public Safety Commission of Tokyo. And it was also streamed live on the Internet. About 100,000 people watched this demonstration through the sites such as ustream.
 Korean netizens who heard about this news respond to it in various ways. “I can understand those Japanese,” said one. “Japanese must be scared about the Korean wave,” another commented.
 One person related to the business of Korean wave said “As the spread of the Korean wave becomes stronger, even Japanese feel apprehensive. Both countries have to avoid sentimental antagonism.”
