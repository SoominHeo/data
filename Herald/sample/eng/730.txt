Swimming in the ocean is better than swimming in a public pool
Pro-
 Swimming in the ocean is better
 There’s no limit at the beach. I think swimming in the ocean is better than swimming in a public pool.
 The ocean has more space. Public pools have limited space that we can swim in. However, in the ocean, there is no limit when it comes to swimming.
 At the beach, we can play in the sand when we get tired. We can also enjoy sunbathing and making sand castles. Also, at the ocean, there are natural waves that make beautiful sounds and that we can touch. Unfortunately, we cannot have this in a swimming pool. There are no sounds of the sea and no waves.
 For these reasons, I think swimming in the ocean is better than swimming in a public pool.
 Con-
 Swimming in a public pool is better 
I think swimming in a public pool is better than swimming in an ocean. Public pools are more comfortable than the ocean. 
 First, the ocean can be dirty because many people leave garbage behind when they come. But a public pool is cleaned up by people every day. So if we go swimming in a public pool, there is a lower risk of getting sick. 
 Second, some fish in the ocean can be dangerous. Jellyfish live in the ocean and they sting people. Sometimes people can’t swim because of these things. 
Lastly, public pools offer a much more comfortable setting, with snack bars and shops.
 Swimming in the ocean can be a special experience, but swimming in a public pool is better because it is more comfortable and safe.
