Anti-government snipers join national shooting team
Shooters who fought against the Sri Lankan government were given new tasks by the government, a BBC report said on July 13.
 The snipers, who belonged to the anti-government fightersâ€™ group Tamil Tigers, were chosen to represent Sri Lanka in shooting sports at national level.
 They were picked at a talent-spotting camp held for ex-fighters in June, according to the report.
 The ex-fighters went through a series of rehabilitation programs, and the government officials hope that the shooters will qualify for the South Asian Games in Delhi in 2013.
