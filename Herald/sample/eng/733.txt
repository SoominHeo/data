Putin, Annan to meet on Syrian conflict
U.N. peace envoy to Syria Kofi Annan and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on July 17 to find solutions to the ongoing conflict in Syria, according to the Russian government.
 It said in a statement on July 15 that Putin would affirm Russia’s scheme to resolve the months-old uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
 Sources say the national conflict is serious enough to be called a civil war; The Red Cross reported that 16,000 seem to have lost their lives since the conflict began in March 2011.
 Meanwhile, the United Nations and the Arab League believe that Russia is in the strongest position to force Assad to resign and halt the massacres.
 On July 13, Syrian government troops killed more than 150 people in the central province of Hama, according to local human rights groups.
 They said the forces bombarded the village of Treimsa using tanks and helicopters.
 The village had a population of 7,000, but is now empty after the bombardment, according to residents there who had interviews with AFP.
 The Syrian government denies the attack was a massacre, saying that only a few of the victims killed were civilians.
 Syria’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said in a news conference in Damascus that his government used neither helicopters nor tanks. “What happened was not an attack by the army on innocent civilians,” he said.
 While Kofi Annan was scheduled to meet the Russian president on July 17, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met China’s foreign minister Yang Jiechi to help bring pressure on al-Assad to end the conflict.
