Korea to allow scientific whaling in its waters
The Korean government notified its plan to resume whaling to the International Whaling Commission (IWC), despite the mounting criticism from the international community. 
Throngs of environmentalists and anti-whaling countries around the world have shown their discomfort with the announcement. 
In response, the government assured that the resumption will only be strictly limited to scientific purposes and it will not allow circulation or consumption of the whale meat in the local market. 
“The country chooses to resume whaling to identify and study marine species, especially whales in Korean waters,” Kang Joon-seok, head of the ministry’s fishery policy bureau, asserted. Yet, he noted that if there is another way to do the needed research, alternatives will surely be considered.
 The government seemed to distance itself as far as possible from Japan, a neighbor that has been condemned for selling whale meat after it had promised to use whaling for its scientific research. 
In fact, scientific whaling does not require IWC approval but Seoul is willing to closely consult with the committee before it makes a final decision.
 “The bottom line is Korea will fully respect the recommendations of the IWC’s Scientific Committee regarding its decision to resume whaling,” an official from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries remarked.
 The government, feeling the pressure, said on July 17 that it will retract the previous announcement altogether. 
The IWC charter forbids whaling of 12 whale species but Korea has banned catching all types of whales since 1986, says Yonhap News.
 It is believed that around 80,000 whales in the nearby waters eat up 146,000 tons of fish annually, close to 12 percent of the nation’s annual fisheries production. 
“The country was trying to limit its numbers,” the ministry noted.
