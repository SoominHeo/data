Household pets help ensure babies’ good health
Good news for pet-loving parents: a recent study has found that kids are less likely to get sick if they live with pets as babies. A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics has found that rather than raising a baby in an overly clean environment, having pets may be better for babies’ health. 
The new study found that children who lived with dogs or cats during their first year of life were sick less frequently than kids raised in a pet-free environment. 
Past research supports this counterintuitive find. In fact, according to one study, children with cats or dogs were less likely to develop gastroenteritis. Other studies have suggested that the dirt and germs brought indoors by pets could help bolster a child’s immune system. 
The recent study tracked the health of 397 Finnish children born between September 2002 and May 2005. Once the children were 9 weeks old, parents were asked to keep a diary documenting their child’s health. When the children celebrated their first birthdays, parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire. 
In the end, researchers found that babies raised in households with cats and dogs got sick fewer times than those raised without pets. In fact, babies living with dogs were 31 percent more likely to be in good health compared to babies without pets. Likewise, babies living with cats were only 6 percent less likely to get sick compared to those without cats. 
“It’s more support in a growing body of evidence that exposure to pets early in life can stimulate the immune system to do a better job of fighting off infection,” Dr. Danelle Fisher, vice chair of pediatrics at St. John’s Health Center who wasn’t involved in the study, was quoted as saying in the Los Angeles Times.
