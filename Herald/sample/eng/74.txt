According to the Bank of Korea, Korea’s foreign exchange reserves rose to a new record high in August.

 In April 2010, the domestic market saw Korea’s foreign exchange reserves going over $300 billion for the first time due to robust flow of foreign investments.
 In July, the BOK bought gold for the first time in 13 years.
