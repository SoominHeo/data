Turn up the summer heat with ‘StreetDance 2!’
As a follow up to the 2010 U.K. hit “StreetDance 3-D,” “StreetDance 2” incorporates the rhythmic energy of Latin dance to the raw power of street dance into another must-see dance flick. 
Movies based on street dance have become popular since Hollywood’s “Step Up” achieved unprecedented success in 2006. The draw of such films is similar to action films. The thrill of watching people push their bodies to the limit and the potential of mind over body. It is a celebration of the never-ending possibilities of the human body. 
The dancers of “StreetDance 2” are no different. Directed by Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini, the film combines the rhythmic precision of Latin dance with the raw spontaneity of street dance. The film shows you a whole new flavor of dancing. In fact, the temptation to go dancing after you see this film will be hard to resist. 
The story centers on American street dancer Ash (Falk Hentschel), who suffers a humiliating defeat during a street dance competition against the dance crew Invincible. In an effort to regain his pride, Ash sets out to find the best street dancers in Europe. His quest brings him to an underground salsa club, where he finds the beautiful and talented Eva (Sofia Boutella), the club owner’s niece. With the dance crew finally assembled, there is only one thing left to do: a dance rematch with Invincible.
 Set against the beautiful backdrop of Europe and jaw-dropping dance moves, “StreetDance 2” is sure to get your head bobbing and your feet tapping.
