Choi Na-yeon wins U.S. Women‘s Open Golf Championship
Choi Na-yeon won the U.S. Women’s Open Golf Championship in Wisconsin, her first championship ever as a professional LPGA golfer. 
 Choi, ranked No. 5 in the women’s race, finished the four-round game on July 9 with 7-under-par. She beat her fierce competitor Amy Yang by 4 shots. 
 With winning the coveted title, Choi, 24, born on Oct. 28, 1987 in Seoul, became the sixth South Korean golfer to win the U.S. Women’s Open.
 Choi became a professional golfer after winning the LPGA of Korea Tour (KLPGA) against the World Golf Hall of Famer, Park Se-ri. She was only 17 years old.
 Her victory in the U.S. Women’s Open Golf Championship was played out at Blackwolf Run, the same venue where Park Se-ri won her title in 1998. They shared their moment of celebration after the game.
 Choi is among the young generation of South Korean LPGA players dubbed “Se-ri Kids” who grew up watching Park rise to become a global LPGA legend. 
 The U.S Women’s Open is one of the LPGA Tour’s four major championships, along with the LPGA Championship, the Women’s British Open and the Kraft Nabisco Championship. It is the oldest championship among the four majors. 
 Since its founding in 1950, the event has been recognized as the only major by the LPGA. The U.S. Women’s Open offers the highest prize money in women’s golf and this year it is reported that an estimated total of $3.25 million was at stake for the event.
