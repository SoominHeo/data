Gray hair a possible sign of health
Whereas graying hair is broadly thought of as an indicator of getting old, a new study has given a fresh look by saying it can also be a sign of great health, according to a report from Livescience.com. 
The July 23 report compared the fur colors of two wild boars - red and gray, and pointed out that the ones with gray fur were stronger against chemical stress and were healthier.
 The scientists in the study related the boar test to humans on the grounds that the two species belong to same group of “upper vertebrates.”
