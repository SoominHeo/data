Big bear runs through mall
A mall in the United States was evacuated after a bear was spotted around a Sears store, UPI reported on July 22.
 The female brown bear entered the mall around 9 p.m. and wildlife protection officers lured the bear toward the entrance doors, UPI quoted a local report as saying.
 The bear was trapped between the double doors and shot twice with a tranquilizer gun, according to UPI.
 Reportedly, there was no one hurt during the incident and the bear was taken away by the officers.
