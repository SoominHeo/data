Muslim athletes in London exempted from fast 
Muslims are supposed to stop eating or drinking during the daytime for 30 days during the Ramadan period, but those in London chose not to go by the rules for their athletic performance, according to AP news.
 The Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim year, during which Muslims do not eat between the rising and setting of the sun. It started on July 20 this year in most Muslim countries.
 With the London Olympics approaching, Muslim athletes are questioning whether they have to stick to the tradition of fasting, worrying that it will influence their performance in sports games.
 Egyptian Kayaker Mustafa Saied was quoted as saying in an AP interview: “I could not fast. I need to take in protein, carbs and minerals. ... I can do it after Ramadan and Allah will accept it because there was an important reason.”
 In fact, some Muslim athletes have looked for Islamic tenets which allowed exemptions from fasting such as for traveling, the AP news explained.
 It added that others decided to delay their fasting until after competitions or compensate for the lost days with charity work.
 Sports experts express concern that if athletes were to go through the fasting period, they would likely lose their competitive edge in the games.
 Another Muslim athlete Yasser Hefny also said during the AP interview that it would be impossible for Muslim athletes to fast during London Olympics, explaining that they still made a lot of effort to hold up their religious beliefs.
 The High Egyptian Islamic Council gave Olympic athletes an exemption this year by stating that they were not required to fast during coaching or competition in London.
