 Korea to groom ‘cyber diplomats’
As part of “digital diplomacy,” the Foreign Ministry plans to groom a pool of young students as cyber diplomats, raising the country’s awareness with the help of social networking services.
 After striking an agreement with VANK (Voluntary Agency Network of Korea), a non-governmental organization dedicated to raising the awareness of Korea, the ministry launched a pilot project to train 500 young students. 
 “The government aims to nurture civilian digital diplomats and facilitate the spread of digital hallyu,” a related official said.
