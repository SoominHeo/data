Korea looks to send PKO troops to S. Sudan
The government plans to dispatch some 300 peacekeeping troops to South Sudan. 
According to a government official, a motion will be submitted to the National Assembly by July. If it is passed quickly, troops could be sent as early as the end of this year.
 The government was reportedly received a request last August from the U.N. Secretariat to dispatch troops to the African nation.
 Following 50 years of civil war, South Sudan separated from the Republic of Sudan last July and became an independent country.
