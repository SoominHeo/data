Former finance minister becomes Indian President
Pranab Mukherjee, former finance minister of India, was elected President on July 22, boosting hopes that he would jump-start the country’s slowing economy.
 Mukherjee, who led the nation’s Finance Ministry in the 1980s, was also a senior leader of the Indian National Congress until he resigned from political office.
 Experts believe that Mukherjee will take a more active approach toward the national economy as the country faces a parliamentary deadlock and economic recession.
 Press Trust of India, a local news agency, announced Mukherjee, 76, as the winner after he garnered over half the votes. He easily beat his only rival P.A. Sangma, 64, a former lower house speaker who was backed by the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, explained AFP news.
 Under India’s political system, the prime minister (currently Manmohan Singh) has the greatest executive power, while the president plays a leading role in the process of forming governments.
 Sanjay Kumar, an analyst at India’s Center for the Study of Developing Societies, said Mukherjee would be able to steer the ship of the state well as a great troubleshooter.
 Mukherjee’s first stint as finance minister of India was during the Indira Gandhi government in 1982. His first term was noted for his work in improving the finances of the government.
 Although he was rated the best finance minister in the world according to a survey of Euromoney Magazine in 1984, Mukherjee was removed from the ministerial position the same year.
 He came back to the scene in 1991 as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission of India. Until his term expired in 1996, Mukherjee oversaw many economic reforms and helped open the Indian economy.
