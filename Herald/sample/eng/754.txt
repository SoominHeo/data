The dangers of a sedentary lifestyle
With the return of the Olympics, top athletes from around the world have gathered to compete for the gold. Such athleticism sits in stark contrast to the millions of viewers around the world sitting at home watching the Olympics on TV from the comfort of their couches. 
To coincide with the Olympics, a series of articles were published in the journal the Lancet, outlining the dangers of leading a sedentary lifestyle. One of the studies focused on the health risks caused by inactivity, rather than focusing on why exercise is important. 
Although everyone knows the importance of exercise, the study found that one in three adults worldwide does not exercise the recommended 150 minutes per week. Even children aged 13-15 were found to be very inactive; getting less than the recommended one hour of exercise a day. 
The study estimates that 3.5 million deaths a year are caused by a lack of exercise. This estimate is based on the impact of inactivity on coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer; in particular breast and bowel cancer, where lack of exercise is considered a major risk factor. 
Physical activity for young people aged 5-18
 According to the National Health Society, young people aged 5-18 need to exercise at least one hour a day to stay healthy. The exercise should be a mix of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Three days a week, muscle-strengthening activities and bone-strengthening activities should be included. Below are some examples of the different types of activities.
