‘The Dark Knight Rises’
“The Dark Knight Rises” is not just another hyper-anticipated superhero blockbuster film of the summer. It is the movie of the summer. Much like the last movie of the Harry Potter franchise, “The Dark Knight Rises” is the last of an epic series: a Batman trilogy as written and directed by Christopher Nolan. 
The story begins with a look at Gotham City eight years after the events of “The Dark Knight” (2008). Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a once-powerful and admired hero who has become a recluse following the events of “The Dark Knight.” With crime largely eradicated and his reputation virtually destroyed, Batman disappears from Gotham City as a broken man. Having taken the fall for the misdeeds of Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart in “The Dark Knight”), Batman (and of course, Bruce Wayne) spends his days locked up inside Wayne Manor, hiding from the world. 
As the people of Gotham City begin to relax and let their guard down, a new threat to the city arrives in the form Bane (Tom Hardy). Resentful and angry at the prosperous, generous and welcoming society of Gotham City, Bane attacks the stock exchange and begins recruiting allies in the city’s sewers. Now, Batman is faced with having to return to save the city that had turned its back and branded him an enemy. 
In a surprising move to many, Nolan chose to forgo the use of 3-D in filming, instead choosing to use the higher resolution and expensive format of IMAX. In an interview with Deadline, an online news magazine, Nolan defended his decision, saying the use of 3-D for “The Dark Knight Rises” wasn’t “compatible” with the story.
 “We are finishing our story on the next Batman [“The Dark Knight Rises”], and we want to be consistent to the look of the previous films,” he said.
