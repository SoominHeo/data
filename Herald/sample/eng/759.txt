N. Korea names new vice marshal: Hyon Yong-chol
The fledgling leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, has been bestowed the title of marshal, the top commander of the communist nation’s 1.2-million-strong army, reported AP.
 Along with Kim’s renewed title, came an abrupt departure of Ri Yong-ho, enormously powerful army chief of the Korean People’s Army. He was thought to be a devout aide of the late Kim and a guardian of the current leader. 
 The surprising reshuffling in the North’s party politics has been interpreted in the Southern part of the peninsula as one of the first political purges made by Kim Jong-un as he poises to solidify his power; by a way of asserting his control over the army.
 “It is speculated that there was a possible power struggle inside the reclusive nation,” Paik Hak-soon, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute pointed out.
 As Ri was relieved from all of his long-held posts, a much less-known, relatively young Army General Hyon Yong-chol was elevated to vice-marshal. His predecessor, Ri previously held the same rank. 
 “Ri Yong-ho’s demotion as army chief was due to his illness,” said the KCNA, North Korea’s official media outlet. “Gen. Hyon was awarded the title of vice marshal.” 
 However, senior officials in the South see it as a political decision. “The decision to remove Ri Yong-ho from all of his positions and award Hyon Yong-chol with a new title of army chief is a way of ensuring loyalty to Kim’s regime,” they argued. 
 Ri Yong-ho was an extremely influential army chief and vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission. He also held top posts in the country’s ruling Workers’ Party.
 What has been played out in this nation can be considered “a reconstitution of the North Korean leadership from the old to new,” AP suggested.
