Libya conflict: when will it end?
Despite losing control of most of the country in the recent months, the former Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has vowed to fight to the death. 
While Gadhafi’s wife, daughter and two of his sons have already fled to Algeria, Gadhafi’s current whereabouts are unknown, though there are rumors that he is attempting to go south, toward Chad or Niger.
 In fact, Niger officials reported that Gaddafi’s security chief and a number of former Libyan officials had arrived in the capital of Niger on Sept. 7 in a heavily armed convoy. It is believed that the convoy consists of at least 50 heavily armed vehicles, including Tuareg fighters who were recruited by Col. Gadhafi. 
Allowed to enter the country on humanitarian grounds, Mansour Daw, who headed Gadhafi’s personal security brigade, arrived in the northern Niger city of Agadez with “Vehicles carrying gold, euros and dollars (which) crossed from Jufra into Niger with the help of Tuaregs from the Niger tribe,” Fathi Jaba from Libya’s National Transitional Council told Reuters. 
Gadhafi is not believed to be traveling with them.
 U.S. officials have been calling for Niger to stop these men from reuniting with Gadhafi. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland has said, “We have strongly urged the Niger officials to detain those members of the regime who may be subject to prosecution.”
 Meanwhile, the NTC is still trying to negotiate talks with the town of Bani Walid, one of the four towns and cities still controlled by Gadhafi supporters. The others are Jufra, Sabha and Sirte, Gadhafi’s birthplace.
