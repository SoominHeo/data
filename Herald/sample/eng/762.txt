Japan’s eco-group rallies at parliament
Protesters wearing masks and white costumes linked arms around Japan’s parliament on July 29, to demonstrate against its government’s use of nuclear power.
The protest was the latest in a series of rallies in Japan since Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda ordered the restart of two nuclear reactors in June.
Such weekly demonstrations outside the Prime Minister’s residence drew tens of thousands of people on every occasion in Tokyo, according to AFP.
Japan’s massive earthquake and tsunami in March led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was the largest such incident since the Chernobyl explosion in 1986.
With the Fukushima accident came a series of nuclear meltdowns and radioactive material releases.
Prime Minister Noda called for the resumption of the nuclear reactors, citing severe power shortage problems in summer.
Meanwhile, demonstrators gathering around the parliament put up signs saying that they do not want nuclear power.
Hiroko Yamada, an elderly woman from Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, told Reuters: “We are here to oppose nuclear power, which is simply too dangerous.”
She also said that Noda did not listen to people and acted against people’s interests.
The Prime Minister, who approved the resumption of the nuclear reactor operations, said he would decide on a new medium-term energy plan by August, according to Reuters.
