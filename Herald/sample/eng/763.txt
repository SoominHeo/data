Singer Kim Jang-hoon awarded the U.S. President’s Volunteer Service Award
Korean rock-ballad singer Kim Jang-hoon, known as the “angel of donation” in the domestic entertainment industry for his sincere devotion to volunteer service, has received the U.S. President’s Volunteer Service Award, his management agency said.
Kim accepted the award during his July 21 concert in Los Angeles. Before the concert, Kim donated all the proceeds from the concert as well as guarantees from ads through a local organization. 
The popular singer also donated $50,000 to an organization that works for drug addicts in the U.S. and another $8,000 to a charity group run by a local church for South Koreans living in the United States.
The White House chose Kim as the winner, taking into account his exemplary contributions toward both Korean and American society, the organizer noted.
His donations have so far amounted to 15 billion won. “He wants to see his concerts and donations contribute to promoting friendship between South Korea and the USA,” said his management agency.
Returning from his trip, Kim held a press conference in Seoul. At the conference, he expressed his deep gratitude and announced his plan to establish a foundation for Dokdo.
He has been an avid advocate of Korea’s sovereignty over Dokdo and worked hard to get more people to recognize it as legitimate Korean territory. He ran several ads in American media outlets, including The New York Times, hoping to raise awareness that the islets are rightly South Korean.
