‘East Sea’ used alongside ‘Sea of Japan’ in top world atlas
France’s top atlas publisher has adopted both Korean and Japanese names for the waters between the two nations.
It is the first time that the Korean name has been used with the same prominence as the Japanese name.
Many world atlas publishers have put the Korean name in brackets or in smaller letters, giving the impression that the “Sea of Japan” is the primary term for the waters, reports Yonhap News.
The latest move by the “Le Grand Atlas,” is expected to encourage other international publishers to follow suit.
South Korea has long campaigned for the adoption of both names.
