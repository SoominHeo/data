Korea builds desalination facility in East Timor
Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), an organization that works in overseas development assistance, has financed a $6 million desalination facility in East Timor.
At the request of East Timor’s government, Korea provided machinery and experts for the construction.
Korea’s desalination technology, which turns salt water into drinking water, is expected to ease the country’s water shortage and improve public health and hygiene conditions in the region.
