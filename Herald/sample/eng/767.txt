IMF issues warning on Korean economy
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of a possible contraction of the Korean economy caused by the continuing European financial crisis.
In its Global Financial Stability Report released on July 16, the IMF said Asian countries in general appeared to be safer from the euro crisis than those in Central and Eastern Europe.
But it added that export-dependent economies such as Korea would likely face adverse economic effects affected by weaker external demand.
In fact, Korea’s exports to the European Union in the first half of 2012 decreased 16 percent from 2011, and its exports to China also declined 1.5 percent over the same period.
International financial institutions are downgrading Korea’s growth forecast as well. JPMorgan, for example, lowered Korea’s growth outlook from 3.3 percent to 2.9 percent in June.
The Bank of America also warned that Korea’s growth outlook will slow to 1.8 percent if external conditions worsen further. Earlier, the bank forecast the rate to be around 3 percent.
Against the backdrop of this, the Korean government had a brainstorming session on the nation’s economy on July 21 with the prime minister, the finance minister and other key economic officials.
In the meeting, the Finance Minister said his ministry would do its best to boost economic growth to the desired 3 percent. Korea’s GDP growth in the second quarter stood at 0.4 percent.
The officials in the meeting churned out measures to activate dwindling exports in shipbuilding and plant-manufacturing. They also agreed to increase support for small and medium-sized companies engaged in export businesses.
