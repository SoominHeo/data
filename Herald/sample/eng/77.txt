Korea’s consumer prices show unfettered growth
Korea’s consumer prices grew at the fastest pace in three years in August, causing industry experts to feel eerie of a possible build up of inflationary pressure, Yonhap News said on Sept. 1. 
The Korean government has been carrying out efforts to fight inflation. At the beginning of 2011, it put its target level of inflation at 4 percent.
 However, the recent reading by Statistics Korea showed that those efforts had no defining effect. Korea’s consumer price index rose 5.3 percent in August. It was the second largest growth since the same month of 2008 when prices increased by 5.6 percent. It has been eight straight months since consumer inflation surpassed 4 percent this year. 
“ Larger-than-expected price increase in August was attributed to surging prices of farm products and gold,” Yoon Jong-won, director general of the finance ministry’s economic policy bureau claimed. 
According to Mr. Yoon, the price is likely to “go down to around 4 percent after the Chuseok holiday.” He said that usually demands for food and services grow during the Chuseok season. “The prices of vegetables and fruits would stabilize after Chuseok,” he added. 
Already, industry has witnessed 13.8 percent surge in fresh food prices last month. The costs of agriculture, livestock and fishery products rose by 13.3 percent. Prices for manufactured goods also gained 7.1 percent and service sector saw 3.1 percent price increase due to rising home rents and public service payments.
 These figures show that the government might be losing its battle against inflation. 
The Korean government has set stabilizing inflation as its top policy priority. It raised the 2011 inflation target from 3 percent to 4 percent in June due to rising food and oil costs. One industry expert noted that “the government would make its utmost efforts to respond to changing economic conditions, including inflation as flexibly and swiftly as possible.“
