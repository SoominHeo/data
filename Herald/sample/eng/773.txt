Saudis criticize female judoka
The first ever Saudi woman to compete in London Olympics is caught into controversy as locals find fault with her participation.
The 16-year-old judoka Wojdan Shaherkani participated in the Olympic Games wearing a swimming cap to cover her hair on Aug. 3.
It was the first time the conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia sent a woman to the Olympics, and Shaherkani came near to being expelled from the Games because she was trying to play with the Islamic hijab on.
Her efforts did not please the conservatives back in her country, and many of them posted insulting messages on SNS sites including Twitter.
Mohammed al-Barrak, a lecturer at Umm Al-Qura University, said to Shaherkani on Twitter: “You do not represent the chaste Muslim woman.”
Ali Seraj Shaherkani, the athlete’s father, wrote to Saudi Arabia’s Interior Minister with copies of insults made on Twitter, according to AFP.
“I have sent an urgent letter to the Minister of Interior Prince Ahmed bin Nayef bin Abdul Aziz with copies of all attacks made on Twitter,” said the father to AFP. He added that a lawyer had been hired to sue those who attacked his daughter.
But most tweets hailed Shaherkani’s courage, AFP explained. Many other people deplored racist comments on Twitter targeted at Shaherkani over her origins, said the news.
The father said in the interview with AFP that it was his honor for his daughter to participate in the competition and to have represented Saudi Arabia, adding that his daughter would start training for the 2016 Olympics.
