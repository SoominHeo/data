Obama, Romney compete on economy
U.S. President Barack Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney both argue that they are better equipped to fix the economy, AP news said on Aug. 5.
The two, who are running for presidency at the end of the year, are said to have pointed to economic data to explain that they are better prepared to revitalize the slowing economy.
The current U.S. economy is not growing enough to reduce unemployment and no signs of help are coming from the U.S. Congress or U.S. allies, said the report.
