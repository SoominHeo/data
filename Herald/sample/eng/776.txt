BOK buys more gold in July
The Bank of Korea (BOK), Korea’s central bank, announced that it has increased its gold holdings in July as part of efforts to diversify its foreign exchange reserve portfolio.
Seoul bought 16 tons of gold, raising its total holdings of the pricey metal to 70.4 tons, valued at $2.98 billion. With it, the size of the country’s foreign exchange reserves has also risen to $314.35 billion as of the end of July. Currently gold makes up of 0.9 percent of Korea’s overall foreign exchange reserves. 
This latest purchase was the bank’s third since July 2011 and its second purchase came in last November.
“The stabilization of the local currency market and the volume of the foreign reserves gave the central bank a room for another purchase,” commented Lee Jung, the head of the investment strategy team at the BOK’s Reserve Management Group.
The decision is rooted in the thinking that at times of economic instability, the appetite for safe assets rises, says Yonhap News. This high-liquidity commodity has been widely viewed by investors as safe investment destination and a way to hedge inflation risks.
A downward-spiral global economic outlook resulting from prolonged financial crisis in the European Union has pushed the government to increase its gold holdings.
The BOK has been trying to diversify its foreign exchange reserves; in particular, focusing on lowering the nation’s portion of U.S. dollar-denominated assets. 
Foreign exchange reserves include securities and deposits denominated in overseas currencies, IMF reserve positions, special drawing rights and gold bullion.
Korea now stands at 40th spot in the world gold holdings and it is the seventh-largest foreign exchange reserves holder.
