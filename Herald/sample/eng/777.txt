Korea seeks to stabilize grain prices
The government is trying to shrug off the impact of international crop price rises on domestic inflation.
Korea depends on imports for most of its corn and wheat but aggravated weather conditions, such as droughts in places like the United States and South America have evoked the fear of agflation. 
According to Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan, the government will play a role in cushioning the risk of a market failure “through expanding its financial support for local crop importers” and work hard to secure sufficient grain products for the public.
Agflation is a phenomenon in which inflation results from a rise in food prices.
