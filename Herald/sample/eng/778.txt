　‘The Thieves’ steals box office crown
Korean heist film, “The Thieves” continued to draw a stellar number of moviegoers as it nears its third week in theaters.
According to the official box office tally, it already drew 7.5 million viewers nationwide since its opening day. It sold nearly 500,000 tickets on July 30 alone as many Koreans took their vacation and visited movie theaters, say industry analysts. 
“The Thieves” was directed by Choe Dong-hoon, known for his previous box office mega-hit “Tazza: the High Rollers,” and stars top Korean actors including Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Hye-soo, Kim Yun-seok and Lee Jung-jae.
