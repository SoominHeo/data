Uphill battle for Japan’s new PM
A recent AP-GfK poll found that Japanese people generally distrust the government and their leaders, especially since the events of March – the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident.

Kan had served only 15 months as prime minister amid widespread criticism of his administration’s handling of the crises.
