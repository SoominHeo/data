Korea to expand economic ties with Myanmar
Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan met Myanmarese Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin on Aug. 3 at Kim’s office in Seoul and the two ministers shared thoughts on strengthening the two countries’ economic collaboration in multiple sectors, the Foreign Ministry said on Aug. 6.
Kim and the Myanmarese minister, who was on a Seoul trip from Aug. 2 to 5, expressed satisfaction with the two countries’ recent economic exchanges.
They discussed in-depth measures to step up cooperation in trade, investment, development, resources and people-to-people exchanges.
The two leaders also appreciated active high-level exchanges, such as the bilateral summit between the two countries on May 14.
Additionally, they discussed ways to work together, not only in areas the two countries have cooperated so far - government affairs, economy, trade and development - but also those with great potential for cooperation, such as energy, resources, culture and education.
They also touched on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Myanmar.
Minister Kim explained the North Korean nuclear and missile issues posed a grave threat to both Korean economy and non-proliferation efforts of the international community. He requested strong cooperation from Myanmar’s government on the issues. 
Wunna Maung Lwin’s visit to Korea marked the first such visit by a Myanmarese Foreign Minister since 1999. The visit, which took place after recent positive changes in Myanmar, is expected to serve as a significant opportunity to further develop Korea-Myanmar relations, said Korea’s Foreign Ministry.
