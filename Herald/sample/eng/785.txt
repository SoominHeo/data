K-pop girl group T-ara tainted with bullying controversy
The controversy over T-ara’s ostracizing of one of its members spread like wildfire, disappointing many Koreans, especially the girl group’s fans.
The whole controversy broke out when Hwa-young of T-ara allegedly posted messages online hinting that she had been bullied by her group members.
As the controversy built, Kim Gwang-soo, the president of the group’s management agency, announced that T-ara would move on without Hwa-young as a seven-member group, citing her “troublesome attitude” and the possible “adverse influence on the group’s uniformity.” 
The agency consistently asserted that the bullying incident had never happened, but the agency’s sudden decision to leave Hwa-young out of the group has enraged the public, many of are demanding to know “the truth.” 
Bullying is a grave problem in Korea, and the news of bullying by a popular K-pop group added to the attention given to the issue. 
“I’m sorry for disappointing fans who loved me,” Hwa-young posted on her personal Twitter account on July 31. 
Tainted by the controversy, it will not be easy for T-ara to restore its name. Already around 6,000 members left the group’s official fan club, “Queen’s” since the controversy. 
An Internet community “T-Jinyo,” which stands for “We Demand the Truth from T-ara,” has also started operating. Only two days after opening, more than 250,000 people had joined.
Engulfed in public criticism, T-ara postponed its first concert at Seoul’s Jamsil stadium on Aug. 11.
