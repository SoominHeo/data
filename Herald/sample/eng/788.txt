Finland risks recession: finance minister
Finland could slip back into recession in 2013 if the global economic slowdown persists, Reuters reported on Aug. 6 quoting the countryâ€˜s finance minister.
The minister also sharply undercut a June growth forecast for the country to 1.2 percent.
The minister Jutta Urpilainen said the economy might shrink depending on what happens in the international economy. She added that a Europe-wide slump was likely to be coming.
Finland is trying to underpin economic growth while also preserving its status as one of better-equipped countries to avoid further recession.
The country exited recession in the second quarter of 2010, said Reutures.
Urpilainen also said that further austerity measures were unlikely in 2013 beyond the fiscal plan the government set in March this year.
The Finnish government will discuss the 2013 budget proposal being drafted by Urpilainen later in August, according to Reuters.
Finland has one of the strongest balance sheets in Europe with public debt at around 49 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2011, Reuters explains, and the government ran a budget deficit of just 0.8 percent in 2011.
Reuters added that Finland also faces an ageing population and prospects of slow growth, as flagship technology firms including Nokia struggles to compete with global rivals.
