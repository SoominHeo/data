Nation on alert as algae threatens water supply
The Seoul Metropolitan Government issued its first algae warning in four years on Aug. 9, Yonhap News reported. Korea was placed on alert just a few days eariler as fast-spreading algal blooms on major rivers and lakes began threatening to affect public health and drinking water. 
According to the government, the sudden appearance of such large amounts of algae can be attributed to the hot weather and long drought that has been plaguing citizens this past month.
A single-celled organism, the blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, is toxic to humans and other animals. Their rapid spread can be attributed to this summer’s heat wave, which in turn raised water temperatures. Cyanobacteria typically thrive in nutrient-rich environments, warm temperatures and still waters.
The spread of algae is believed to have started in the upper streams of the Han River in late June before it spread through various rivers and lakes.
Environmental groups have also come forth to warn against the possible spread of a carcinogenic alga as well. Called microcystis, this carcinogenic alga is known to cause liver disease, including liver cancer. The Korea Herald reported that some environmental groups have claimed that microcystis was detected in the Nakdong River, which is the water source for people in the Gyeongsang Provinces as well as some other major cities. 
“It is advised [that people] refrain from activities in the water and to drink tap water only after it’s been boiled or [refrigerated],” a city official was quoted as saying by Yonhap News.
As of Aug. 8, the Seoul government had secured 12 tons of yellow soil to be used for containing the algal blooms.
