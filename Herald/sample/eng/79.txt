 WikiLeaks is at it again
A few weeks ago, more than 250,000 uncensored copies of classified U.S. State Department cables were leaked online. Unlike previous publications, the names of informants and other such sensitive information were not removed before being posted online. 
Dinah PoKempner, the general counsel of Human Rights Watch tells the New York Times, “We are not aware of anyone who has been arrested or injured because they were named in the cables,” adding, “we remain concerned about the potential for reprisals” as a result of the recent WikiLeaks dump.
