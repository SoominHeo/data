Is bottled water really good for you?: Part 2
Drinking bottled water has become part of our everyday lives. In Korea especially, most people would never consider drinking water straight from the tap for fear of it being dirty. 
As discussed in last week’s issue, however, a recent article on HealthDay found that drinking purified water may not be as healthy as drinking fluoridated tap water. 
Unfortunately, despite the fact that drinking fluoridated tap water is widely supported by many health and dental organizations, much of the public still fear the possibility of negative side effects. 
Specifically, Korea was involved in a dispute over nationalizing the fluoridation of tap water earlier this year. Opponents of the project argued that enforcing the fluoridation of tap water could trigger osteoporosis and raise lead levels in the blood stream. However, a 2008 study conducted by the Department of Preventative Medicine at the Seoul National University and the Institute of Environmental Medicine found that consuming fluoridated drinking water over several decades had no effect on the risk of diminishing bone strength. 
“Fluoride -- no matter how it gets to the tooth surfaces -- toothpaste, water, rinses, varnishes, gels, is effective in a multitude of ways,” Dr. Burton Edelstein, president of the Children‘s Dental Health Project in Washington, D.C., was quoted as saying. 
In fact, the U.S. government has hailed tap water fluoridation as one of the greatest achievements in public health.
Edelstein warned that not only is tap water free, when fluoridated tap water is substituted for fluoride-free bottled water, “the advantage of regular, small amounts of healing fluoride is lost and children and adults will be more prone to cavity activity on the surfaces of their teeth.”
