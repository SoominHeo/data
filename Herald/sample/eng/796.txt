Hwang wins another gold in women’s taekwondo in 4 yrs
Hwang Kyeong-seon, a gold-medalist in 2008 Beijing Olympics, captured another gold in the women’s under-67 kilogram taekwondo finals on Aug. 11 in London.
In a match against Turkey’s Nur Tatar, Hwang beat the opponent 12 to 5.
Hwang is the first female taekwondo fighter to win a medal in three straight Olympics.
She won a bronze medal in 2004 and a gold in 2008.
Holding a 5-3 lead after the first of the three two-minute rounds in the gold medal bout, Hwang blew open the match with six points in the second round, said Yonhap News.
She went up 8-3 with a successful kick to the head, and then put on three successive one-point kicks to Tatar‘s body for good measure, the news said.
On Aug. 9 Korea’s Lee Dae-hoon grabbed silver in men’s under-58 kg, and Hwang won the second medal for Korea. However, no more taekwondo athletes from the country won any medals thereafter.
Hwang told reporters that she felt pressure to try to win a gold medal after having watched Lee fail in his attempt to win gold.
“Gold medals in taekwondo are often taken for granted in our country,” she said in the interview with Yonhap News.
“Other athletes celebrate winning silver and bronze medals. It broke my heart seeing Dae-hoon hanging his head low because he won silver.”
She said that she had been through a slump in the past years but that the experience helped her win a second gold medal four years after Beijing.
