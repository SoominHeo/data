Singer Kim Jang-hoon joins Dokdo relay swim
Korean rock star Kim Jang-hoon led a team of 40 Korea National Sports University students to swim to the country’s easternmost islets of Dokdo to mark Korea’s 1945 independence from Japan.
Alongside his fellow actor Song Il-kuk and young Korean athletes, the 45-year-old singer took part in a 220 kilometer relay swim from the southeastern port of Jukbyeon, Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province to the Dokdo islets.
The relay began at 7 a.m. on Aug. 13 and took 48 hours and 30 minutes to arrive at 7:30 a.m. on Aug. 15, Liberation Day, when the group’s last swimmer arrived at the volcanic outcroppings.
While the crew took turn in the relay, a small flotilla was there to escort the squad and guard them from unpredictable waves of the East Sea.
“I think this relay swimming was meaningful because it showed that our young people are interested in Dokdo,” Kim said after completing his relay mission. “The three-day journey was successful enough and I feel happy about that.” Kim is known for his love of Dokdo.
Late swimmer Cho Oh-ryun and his two sons swam to Dokdo in 2005 but it was the first time for an entertainer to swim to the island.
This year is the 67th anniversary of the country’s independence from the Japanese 1910-45 colonial rule. 
Japan has long claimed its sovereignty over the territory but Korea rejected it on the grounds that when it regained independence from Japan in 1945 it also recaptured the islets’ sovereignty. Seoul also views Tokyo’s claim as irresponsible and unrepentant of its imperialist past.
Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since 1954.
