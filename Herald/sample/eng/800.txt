Territorial dispute between China and Japan
Arguments over islands lying between China and Japan came to the fore again on Aug. 15 when pro-China activists reached the rocky island before they were captured by Japanese authorities.
The Chinese group left Hong Kong on Aug. 12 in a boat for the archipelago, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. The group planned to plant a Chinese flag on the island.
Seven people from the boat jumped into the water and reached the rocky shore on late evening of Aug. 15. Two of them returned to the boat.
Japanese police authority told AFP that they arrested the five men for violation of the immigration control law.
Back in Japan, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters that Japan would deal with the incident strictly in line with the law.
Later in the day, Japan said its coast guard had arrested a total of 14 people into custody on suspicion of illegally entering Japanese territory.
Meanwhile, China’s vice-foreign minister Fu Ying summoned the Japanese amabassador to China, Uichiro Niwa, according to Xinhua news agency.
The news also said that Fu telephoned her Japanese counterpart Tsuyohshi Yamaguchi to stress China’s sovereignty over the island. Reportedly, Fu demanded the Japanese guarantee the safety of those arrested.
The incident drew attention from the Northeast Asian region in particular as Aug. 15 marked the anniversary of Tokyo’s surrender in World War II.
China and Korea called for Japan to do more to show regret for its brutal expansionism, while cabinet ministers in Tokyo paid tribute to fallen Japanese soldiers at the controversial Yaskuni Shrine.
