‘Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival,’ a gateway to new world animation
 “The 16th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival (SICAF)” was held from July 18 to 22 in Seoul. 
Aiming to be Asia‘s most inspirational and imaginative art animation festival, SICAF opened its doors to the world’s animation enthusiasts. 
This year’s festival was organized by SICAF Organizing Committee and Seoul Metropolitan Government and was sponsored by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
One of the pieces featured at the 16th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival was the “Barry JC PURVES special.”
The show was made up of puppet animation cinema by Barry JC Purves, who is one of Britain’s most celebrated animators. 
Barry JC Purves has worked in animation for over 30 years and won numerous international awards including Oscar and British Academy Film Awards nominations. 
One very remarkable work of his shown at the venue was “Rigoletteo,” a puppet animation film that was released in England in 1993.
The film “Rigoletto” is based on an original opera piece, “La Maledizione (The Curse).” The tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto’s beautiful daughter Gilda. 
With the curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto, Rigoletto’s daughter Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassins hired by her own father.
The film was filled with opera music, which gave a great depth to the piece. Watching the show instantly leads viewers to the charm of puppet animation and offer them a chance to enjoy a wide range of world animation.
Since its inception in 1995, SICAF’s animation film festival has served as a platform for promising film debuts. Every year around 1,500 films which flaunt their experimental animation techniques are delivered to the venue to greet global movie buffs.
