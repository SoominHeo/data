Murray out in Cincinnati, Federer wins
Olympic champion Andy Murray was defeated 6-4 and 6-4 by France’s Jeremy Chardy on Aug. 16 at the Cincinnati Masters game.
In the previous week, Murray from the United Kingdom won a match in Toronto before giving up with a knee injury but had looked impressive in his first match against American Sam Querrey in Cincinnati.
But Murray’s continuous errors pushed him to a corner, and Chardy became the victor.
After the match, Murray said: “This was like my second or third match in the hard court. I played well yesterday, but didn’t play so well today.”
He added by saying that he could have done it much better.
Meanwhile, Roger Federer gave a flawless performance and crushed Australian opponent Bernard Tomic 6-2 and 6-4.
“Overall I’m happy. But it’s hard to judge my game in these quick conditions,” said Federer, the silver medalist in London Olympics, in an interview with AFP.
“It was a good performance, I’m playing as well as I want to right now,” Federer added.
Novak Djokovic easily won over Nikolay Davydenko, who was suffering a shoulder injury. The match lasted only 30 minutes before quitting after Djokovic took the first set, 6-0.
Davydenko had eight double-faults. Djokovic said after the match: “This is not the way to win a match, it was clear that he was struggling physically.” He hoped that his opponent would be fit for the upcoming U.S. Open.
Olympic bronze medalist Juan Martin del Potro had pain in his left wrist, but won his game over Serbia’s Viktor Troicki with scores of 7-6, 2-6, and 6-1.
