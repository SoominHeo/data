Psy goes global
Psy's “Gangnam Style” broke the 40 million mark in YouTube views on Aug. 20.
The eccentric singer, whose real Korean-name is Park Jae-sang, was not well-known outside Korea before, but now he is a internationally acclaimed star whose music video is enjoying unprecedented recognition.
His video was featured in such major international media outlets as CNN, the L.A. Times, Wall Street Journal and Time magazine in August.
Such renowned musicians as T-Pain, Robbie Williams and Josh Groban also expressed support for the video via their SNS. T-pain tweeted that “words cannot even describe how amazing the video is.”
News reports said Psy plans to have a meeting with Justin Bieber’s manager. Some of the reports said the two will likely sign a deal to produce a remake of Psy’s “Gangnam Style.”
The manager reportedly has praised the music video, tweeting “How did I not sign this guy? Gangnam Style! The greatest.”
The 35-year-old Korean singer’s video, featuring its signature horse-riding dance became a sensation upon its release in July. 
Likewise, Psy’s concert on Aug. 11 reeled in a crowd of more than 30,000, and thousands flocked to his guerilla performance at Seoul’s Gangnam Subway Station intersection on Aug. 14. 
Then on Aug. 15, a second version of the music video came out, with K-pop idol Hyun-a taking the reins. The title of the new song is “You’re Just My Type.”
Psy, who attended Boston University and Berklee College of Music, debuted with his first album in 2001 and signed with YG Entertainment in 2010. The artist who released his sixth album in July that includes “Gangnam Style” plans to enjoy time with his family during his trip to the U.S., during which he is expected to meet up Justine Bieber.
