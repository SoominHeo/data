Japan’s groundless sovereignty claim over Dokdo
South Korea has refused Japan’s proposal to refer the Dokdo matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), making sure that Dokdo is not a matter of judicial settlement.
At a Cabinet meeting held on Aug. 21 in Japan, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, Deputy Prime Minister Katsuya Okada, Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba and Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura reached an agreement to try to bring the Dokdo debate to the U.N. court.
Following South Korean President Lee’s visit to Dokdo, Noda sent a letter to Seoul, expressing his deep regret over Lee’s action. Japan warned the Korean government to act prudently for the sake of the bilateral relationship. What was more problematic with the case was that the content of this state-level letter was disclosed even before Seoul read it, an ill diplomatic gesture.
In response, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said it regards Japan taking the Dokdo issue to the international criminal court as unthinkable because the islets are Korean territory and are effectively controlled by the Korean government, and that there is therefore no territorial dispute.
As the fuss over Dokdo aggravates, Seoul decided to strengthen its vigilance on the islets.
The security guard unit now carries out daily drills in Dokdo, not once a week, “to repel any possible provocation from Tokyo,“ according to Korea National Police Agency. 
The number of radar operation personnel has also been increased to make the speedy response possible in the event of an emergency near the islets.
