Late Ethiopian leader hailed for national development by world leaders
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s body returned home at Addis Ababa airport on Aug. 22 after his death in a Brussels hospital. He was 57.
His coffin, covered with Ethiopian flag, was greeted with thousands of mourning Ethiopians at the airport, including high-ranking political and religious leaders.
Some mourners were seen to carry photos of the late Prime Minister as well.
Although Zenawi was a rebel who ruled the country with an iron fist for the past two decades, his tyranny was met with more compliments than criticism.
He is known to have laid the groundwork for Ethiopia’s economic development and played a pivotal role in mediating regional conflicts.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised his leadership while U.S. President Barack Obama hailed his commitment to the poor in Ethiopia.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said to AFP that she was saddened by Zenawi’ death and that Ethiopia would “peacefully navigate the political transition according to the constitution.”
Ethiopia’s Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, 47, is slated to take over, according to a government spokesman.
Ethiopia led by Zenawi has long been a key ally for Western nations, and he has been leading fight against rebel groups of Somalia.
According to AFP, British Prime Minister David Cameron praised the late leader as “an inspirational spokesman for Africa.”
Meanwhile, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga told the BBC that Zenawi had been “a great leader” but said he “fears for the stability of Ethiopia upon his death.”
Ethiopia after Zenawi sees a power gap in the country, internal threats coming from rebel groups, and ongoing fight against Somalia’s al-Qaida-linked military group Shebab.
