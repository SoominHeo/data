Stickers may help improve kids’ eating habits
Cartoon stickers may be the key to encouraging children to make healthier choices in food, a new study suggests. Researchers found that putting a cartoon sticker on an apple will make it more appealing to children when given a choice between the healthy snack and a cookie. 
The study focused on 208 elementary school students who were offered apples and cookies with lunch for a week. David Just, co-director of the Cornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs, and his colleagues went to suburban and rural schools every day for a week to try out the apple and cookie experiment. 
During the study, they found that children were more likely to pick the apple if it had a cartoon sticker on it. When neither the cookie nor apple had a sticker on it, 91 percent of the children took a cookie while fewer than 25 percent took an apple. When an Elmo sticker was put on the apples, however, the number of children who took the fruit rose to 37 percent. 　
“There are so many foods that are of poor nutritional quality and they are being marketed to children,” Christina Roberto, another researcher studying food choices at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, told Reuters Health. 
The tactic of using kid-friendly characters to appeal to children isn’t used in healthier snacks “as much as they are on a wide range of foods that aren’t so good for kids,” Roberto said. 
“If we’re trying to promote healthier foods, we need to be as smart as the companies that are selling the less-healthy foods,” Just told Reuters Health. Rather than removing branding on kids’ foods completely, Just advocates merely using the same strategies to encourage kids to make healthier choices. 
While stickers are an easy and cheap way to improve a child’s diet, Just added that the use of fun names like “X-ray vision carrots” and “power peas” can also help make fruits and vegetables seem cooler to little kids.
