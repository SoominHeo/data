Korean teenager makes Spanish youth football club
A Korean teenager has joined a top Spainish youth football team. Fourteen-year-old Busan native Sim Seong-ho, a left back, has become the first beneficiary of the national youth development project of the Hong Myung-bo Scholarship Foundation to have been recruited by a foreign youth club. 
Under the Hong Myung-bo Scholarship program, Sim trained in Athletic Bilbao in Aug. 2011. Recently he was selected as a member of Real Valladolid, a youth club under the first division Spanish football league.
“I am grateful for this opportunity,” Sim said at a press conference held in Seoul. “I will try to become a good, hardworking player in Spain. My goal is to stay in Spain throughout and make a professional debut there.”
Pedro Coria, director of Real Valladolid’s youth program commented at the conference, “The club will make its utmost efforts to help Sim adjust in Spain. I hope Sim can start enjoying football in Spain and make it to the senior team in the country.” 
Hong, also at the venue, said that he expects Sim to do great in Spain as he has “great football senses.” 
The Hong Myung-bo foundation was established by Hong Myung-bo, the former national soccer captain and current Olympic team head coach with the aim of developing Korean football by rearing talented future footballers in Korea. 
Since July 2008, the foundation has sent a dozen teenagers overseas to get training in better environments. Already three players were sent to Santos FC in Brazil; six to Corinthians in Brazil; and three, including Sim, to Athletic Bilbao in Spain. Three more players are scheduled to leave for Spain by the end of August this year.
The foundation has also been awarding scholarships to the nation’s less privileged youth players since 2002.
