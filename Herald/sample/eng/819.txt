Snakker du norsk? (Do you speak Norwegian?)
Much like its Scandinavian neighbors, Norway is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Full of natural beauty and with a slow move towards urbanization, Norway finds itself at the crossroads of buzzing city-life and quiet wilderness. Thanks to the sustainability of Norway’s unique farm culture, mass urbanization did not take place as is characteristic of most developed nations. Both in spite of and thanks to this unique demographic, there are an incalculable number of things to experience in Norway.
CITIES
The number one most popular city to visit in Norway is, unsurprisingly, the Norwegian capital of Oslo. As both one of the biggest geographically and least populated city of Europe, Oslo has any and everything that a visitor may want to see and do; from outdoor activities like cycling, kayaking and skiing to cultural exploration in any one of Oslo’s numerous museums, the city truly caters to everyone’s tastes. 
Other notable cities to check out are Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Tromsø.
WILDERNESS
There is an abundance of awe-inspiring natural beauty to be found in Norway, though one natural phenomenon that is almost uniquely Norwegian is the fjord. In fact, the word ‘fjord’ comes from the Norwegian language, referring to long, narrow bodies of water bordered by steep cliffs that are usually formed by glacial erosion. As one of Norway’s most popular tourist attractions, there are more than a thousand fjords to explore, most of which can be found along the Scandinavian coastline. 　
For those looking for a more all-encompassing experience of nature, check out the Jotunheimen National Park. Recognized as one of the country’s premier hiking and fishing regions, it covers 1,151 km2 of land and features more than 250 peaks that rise above 1,900 meters. Wildlife includes reindeer, elk, deer, wolverines and lynx.
