Angela Merkel meets Wen Jiabao in Beijing
German Chancellor Angela Merkel headed to the Chinese capital of Beijing on Aug. 30 to meet her Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao.
The visit was aimed at strengthening trade ties with China and securing support for the fragile economy of the eurozone.
Merkel was accompanied by a delegation of executives from German companies in the auto, chemicals, energy, commodities and other industries.
In the meeting with the German Chancellor, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed caution over Europe’s debt problems and called on Greece, Spain and Italy to conduct budget cuts and other reform measures.
“The European debt crisis has continued to worsen, giving rise to serious concerns in the international community. Frankly speaking, I am also worried,” Wen told reporters at the venue. 
Specifically, Wen expressed concerns as to whether Greece will leave the eurozone, and whether Italy and Spain will take comprehensive rescue measures.
The Chinese Premier, however, said Beijing would continue to invest in the eurozone as long as risks are controlled, according to AP news.
Wen and Merkel held a signing ceremony where the two countries’ industrial collaboration plans were confirmed.
A Chinese state company signed an agreement to purchase 50 Airbus jetliners, and Volkswagen AG, Europe‘s largest automaker, signed a deal to invest $219 million into China’s industrial city of Tianjin, according to AP.
Officials from the two governments also signed a series of agreements to foster cowork in electric vehicles, education and the environment.
Merkel‘s two-day visit in China included meeting with Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who are expected to become China’s next President and Premier, respectively.
The next round of Chinese-German meetings is scheduled for next year, but Wen is said to have asked Merkel to come early before China has the expected power transition to younger leaders in October.
