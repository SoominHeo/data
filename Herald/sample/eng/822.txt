Samsung beefs up its patent system　　
Apple Inc. has applied to add four new Samsung Electronics Co. products to its patent suit at a U.S. federal court.
The iPhone maker filed a lawsuit claiming the Galaxy S3, the Korean company’s latest smartphone model, copied the technology of Apple. It also added the company’s Galaxy Note to the “copy cat” list.
The news came out just a week after Apple put a request in a U.S. court to permanently ban the sales of eight Samsung devices in the country. 
Only a few weeks ago on Aug. 24 a California court delivered a crushing verdict which stated that Samsung to pay damages worth $1.05 billion to the U.S. company. It said Samsung infringed six of the latter’s patents including the famous “bounce-back” feature on phone’s screen. It was a major defeat by Samsung which is gearing up to be the world’s top smartphone maker in the $219 billion global market.
However, unlike the ruling in the U.S., a Japanese court gave the upper hand to the Korean company on Aug. 30. The Tokyo District Court found Apple‘s patent infringement claim on media contents transferring technology, submitted in August 2011, invalid.　
Samsung welcomed the news. “We welcome the court’s decision. We will continue to offer highly innovative products to consumers, and continue our contributions toward the mobile industry’s development,” the company statement read.
Engulfed in the patent conundrum with Apple Inc., Samsung has been enforcing its own patents. The number of patent related personnel at Samsung has risen from 250 in 2005 to 450 last year. 
Korean companies have been seeing a jump in patent disputes over the years as the competitiveness of domestic companies keeps growing in overseas markets. According to the Korean Intellectual Property Office and the Korea Intellectual Property Protection Association, there were 278 international patent litigations involving Korean companies in 2011, up nearly 80 percent up from 154 cases in 2009.
