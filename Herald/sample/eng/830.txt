La magia de Colombia: Adventure holidays (Part 1)
Best known for its aromatic and delicious coffee, Colombia has much to offer anyone willing to brave the country’s notorious history of civil conflict. 
Cultural experiences in Colombia vary from the exciting wilderness of Amazon safaris to the hubbub of modern cities full of skyscrapers. There is also an abundance of colonial cities and archaeological ruins to explore, not to mention high-mountain trekking, whale watching, surfing and more to try out. As the only country in South America with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, the beaches of Colombia alone are enough to take your breath away. 
For those visiting Colombia for the first time, the country’s official travel website divides up all that Colombia has to offer into three general holiday categories: adventure holidays, fun vacations and sight-seeing destinations. 
Adventure holidays
For an exciting, adventure-filled holiday, try your hand at the various extreme sports available in Colombia’s diverse landscapes and regions that are rich in both flora and fauna. For those interested in adventure sports, Colombia’s official tourism website suggests the Santander region of eastern Colombia, where you can experience the adrenaline-pumping excitement of paragliding, kayaking, rafting, bungee jumping, rappelling and spelunking. Santander is also the home of the Canon de Chicamocha, a canyon some say is comparable to the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 
Nature tourism is also a popular draw of Colombia, the second most biologically diverse country on the planet. Not only is part of the Amazon Jungle located in Colombia, this South American country has a plethora of rugged topography ripe for exploring. 
The island of Providencia, for example, is a popular destination for visitors interested in nature and culture. Also called the “Flower of the Ocean,” it was declared a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000.
