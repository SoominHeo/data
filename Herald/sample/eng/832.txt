McDonald's launches vegetarian oriented menu in India
Global fast-food chain McDonald’s will open its first meat-free outlet in India by mid-2013, in an effort to adapt to local demand.
McDonald‘s, which can be defined by its mouthwatering burgers and fries, decided to open the company’s first vegetarian eatery in northern India near the Golden Temple in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
About half of Indians are vegetarian and over 80 percent of the people there observe the Hindu religion, which considers cows sacred. This means Indians naturally steer away from eating beef. 
Rajesh Kumar Maini, spokesman for McDonald’s in northern India, said, “This religious background offers a big opportunity for vegetarian restaurants in India.” 
The new outlet will offer meat-free dishes including salad and other healthier foods with less sugar, salt and fat.
Today, the signature dish in Indian McDonald’s is the McAloo Tikki burger, one that uses a spiced potato-based filling instead of meat. It makes up 25 percent of the country’s total sales.
McDonald’s is the world’s second biggest food outlet after Subway. It plans to open 1,300 new stores around the world this year.
Recently, the company’s longtime chief executive, Jim Skinner, retired from the top job and was replaced by Don Thompson, its former chief operating officer.
Skinner had worked at McDonald’s for 41 years, and under his leadership the company enjoyed its best performance with the market capitalization surpassing over $100 billion for the first time in its history.
The new CEO, Don Thompson, has worked at McDonald’s for 22 years, mainly taking charge of global operations, which stretch to 119 countries. He is the first African-American to run McDonald’s.
