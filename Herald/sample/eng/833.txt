Korea’s global competitiveness: 19th in the world
Korea’s global competitiveness has notched up five spots this year, a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) showed.
The report stated the improvements in the country’s welfare and education systems and market efficiency had helped drive up the upward trend in Korea’s global competitiveness, at 19th among the 144 countries surveyed.
WEF, a Geneva-based independent organization, carried out a comprehensive evaluation of each country’s competitiveness in administration, financial sectors and labor markets.
Korea ranked 62nd place in the administrative sector, up three notches from 2011. Each country’s handling of intellectual property rights and its diversity of public funds are some of the criteria in the category. 
In the welfare and primary education sectors, Korea’s competitiveness has gone up by four notches to 11th spot.
The competitiveness in the financial market for Korea has also risen to 71st place in the world. Last year, Korea ranked at 80th in this category.
“Improvements in all three major sectors helped move up the country’s place in the global competitiveness list from a year earlier,” the Finance Ministry explained. “The country’s place in welfare and primary education, market efficiency and financial market maturity moved up, while its rankings dropped from a year earlier in just two areas of macroeconomics and business innovation.”
Switzerland topped the list, followed by Singapore. Sweden and Finland came in third and fourth, respectively.
The competitiveness of the U.S. dropped two notches from fifth place in 2011 to seventh. Japan also fell from ninth to 10th spot this year.
