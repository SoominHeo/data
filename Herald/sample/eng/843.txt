Korea, Russia promise to seek energy cooperation
Korean President Lee Myung-bak and Russian President Vladimir Putin met head-to-head in Vladivostok on Sept. 8 to foster cooperation on energy development.
The two heads were in the Far Eastern Russian city to attend the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
In the bilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the international summit, Lee hoped that Korea and Russia would further develop economic cooperation despite the ongoing global financial difficulties.
Putin also said Korea was Russia’s third-largest trading partner in Asia after China and Japan. He added that there was much room for further cooperation between the two nations as mutual investment was still insufficient.
Specifically, the two leaders held talks on a project to build a gas pipeline linking Russia to both Koreas.
The project for bringing Siberian natural gas to South Korea has been discussed for the past 20 years. However, no concrete talks have ever been held due to security tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
The talks gained momentum when the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il expressed willingness to allow the pipeline to pass through North Korea.
Lee said that if South Korea and Russia made joint efforts to solve the regional security issues, North Korea’s resolution to permit the gas project would come at an early date.
Meanwhile, Lee’s meeting with the Russian head of state this time was the first of its kind since Putin took office in May this year.
Russia is a member of the long-delayed six-party talks to bring North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs to an end. The other parties are China, Japan and the United States.
