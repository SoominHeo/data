Issue in Focus - Director Kim Ki-duk and ‘Pieta’
 ‘Pieta’ headed to Academy Awards
Director Kim Ki-duk’s Venice International Film Festival prize-winning “Pieta” has been selected as Korea’s entry to the 85th Academy Award’s foreign film section, the Korean Film Council announced on Sept. 13.
A total of five films, including “Taste of Money” by director Im Sang-soo, “In Another Country” by director Hong Sang-soo, “Nameless Gangster” by Yun Jong-bin and “Masquerade” by Choo Chang-min applied to the film council to be considered as Korea’s entry to the Academy Awards. “Pieta” was chosen unanimously, the Korean Film Council said in a statement. 
The overall quality of the film, the possibility of distribution in the U.S., and level of awareness of the film as well as of the director were considered in reviewing the films for submission to the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
A number of Korean films, namely “Mother,” “A Barefoot Dream” and “The Front Line,” were previously submitted to the academy but failed to win awards.
“Pieta” opened in theaters on Sept. 6 and has attracted 171,522 viewers as of Sept. 13. The Academy Awards will be presented in February 2013.
Kim Ki-duk slams film industry’s monopolistic culture
Film director Kim Ki-duk, who won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival with his gruesome morality tale “Pieta,” has criticized the Korean film industry for allowing only a limited number of successful movies to be screened in cinemas.
Kim’s comments came during a shooting for SBS talk show “Gangsimjang” (Strong Heart), before he left for the festival.
“In Korea, popular movies take up four or five screens at a theater,” Kim said, stressing that it was very difficult to do a low-budget film production in the country.
“This is like a cultural monopoly where moviegoers become cultural slaves.”
