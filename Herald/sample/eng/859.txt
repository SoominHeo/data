Admission fraud in foreign schools
The parents of dozens of students attending foreign schools in Seoul’s affluent neighborhood were accused of illegally enrolling their children in foreign schools. 
According to local news outlets, a wife of a lawyer working in the country’s most influential law firm as well as "chaebol" conglomerate executives, hospital heads, a golf resort owner and an investment firm head were questioned over the allegation.
According to the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office, the son and daughter-in-law of a former Hyundai Motor Group vice chairman and offspring of the Lotte Group’s founding family have also been summoned for suspicion.
The admission for these children was approved by fabricated passports and foreign citizenship papers bought from immigration brokers.
They reportedly cost 50 million won to 100 million won each and three schools are under investigation for their involvement in the admission fraud, prosecutors stated. 
Under the law, only children of foreign residents or Korean children who have lived abroad for more than three years are eligible to attend foreign schools in Korea. Currently, there are 51 foreign schools operating in the nation. 
Koreans consider foreign schools a useful alternative to sending children to study abroad at an early age. Attending these schools is advantageous to kids in their later years in terms of expanding their personal networks. 
The latest admission fraud scandal shows the undeniable moral laxity among the affluent Koreans. This gave a deep sense of deprivation to those who are less privileged in society.
