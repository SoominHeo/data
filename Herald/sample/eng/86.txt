Korean economic growth to slow down
Korean economic growth will decelerate influenced by the global economic slowdown, a state-run economic think tank said early September.
 Korea’s economy, Asia‘s fourth-largest, is expected to grow 4.1 percent, lowered from the April forecast of 4.4 percent, the Korea Institute of Finance (KIF) said.
 The institute said that a delayed global economic recovery would decrease Korea’s exports and that the worsening financial markets would prevent households from spending.
 There are concerns that the U.S. credit downgrade and the European sovereign crisis would put the world economy back into recession.
 In August, Korea’s trade surplus decreased to $821 million due to a record high imports volume.
 Korea’s exports, which account for half of national economic volume, are forecast to grow 13.3 percent in the first half and 9.6 percent in the second half, according to financial experts.
 The KIF expected the country‘s consumer prices this year to grow 4.2 percent - higher than the economic growth forecast by 0.1 percent - due to rising food prices and a hike in public utilities charges.
 Consumer prices in August rose 5.3 percent from the previous year, the fastest in three years.
 The KIF warned that if the U.S. economy goes through another recession and the eurozone economy collapses at last, the Korean economy’s growth would shrink again to the upper range of 3 percent in the worst-case scenario.
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan told at a forum in Seoul that the national economy was expected to remain on a robust recovery track but that downside risks had increased.
