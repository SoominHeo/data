Edvard Munch's 'Scream’ to go on show at MoMA
Edvard Munch’s “The Scream,” which became the most expensive artwork sold in the history of art auctioning, will go on view in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for six months from Oct. 24 through April 29. The work will hang on the museum‘s fifth floor under heavy security, The New York Times reported.
The 1895 pastel is one of four versions created by Edward Munch and was sold to an anonymous bidder in May this year for $120 million at Sotheby’s auction house.
“It was an incredible opportunity to see the rare artwork,” MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry said. “This is a great chance for our visitors to see something that is otherwise hard to see.”
The painting’s new owner is believed to be U.S. financier Leon Black. He is the chief executive of Apollo Global Management and a leading collector and a member of MoMA‘s board, the report said. 
Black is said to have developed a passion for art after studying it at Dartmouth College in the early 1970s. In particular, Black developed great affection for the very piece of the Norwegian expressionist artist, believing it to be a “precursor of 20th-century Expressionism.” 
Before “The Scream” was auctioned off, the record price for an artwork sold at auction was a sculpture by Pablo Picasso. The legendary artist’s “Nude, Green Leaves and Bust” was sold for $106.5 million in 2010.
