Korea fastest to recover from global crisis
Among the world’s major economies, Korea is most rapidly recovering from the global financial crisis that occurred in 2008, The Korea Herald reported in September. 
The Korean market posted the highest overall share price increase among 11 major economies of the world during the past four years, said the newspaper citing a report released by the Korea Center for International Finance (KCIF).
According to The Korea Herald, the KCIF assessed 10 other countries that rank the highest in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) including the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, Russia and Canada as well as Korea.
The Russian market showed the biggest improvement, boosted by the hike of raw materials prices including oil price.
Korea came in second in terms of improvement in the exchange rate among the 10 researched countries excluding the U.S, The Korea Herald said.
The Korean won improved significantly against the U.S. dollar by 21.54 percent between October 2008 and September 2012, following that of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar which strengthened 24.4 percent, said the newspaper. 
“Electronics goods and automobiles led the export after the  Lehman crisis, which helped speed up economic recovery. The nation’s household debts and mortgage sector were relatively stable compared to other countries,” Jeong Yeong-sik, a researcher at Samsung Economic Research Institute, was quoted as saying by Yonhap News.
