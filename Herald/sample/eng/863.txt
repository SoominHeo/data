High-school students boycott cafeteria lunch
Students at Mukwonago High School in Wisconsin have chosen to boycott the cafeteria lunch after the school district began to follow new federal requirements, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
The changes come from the updated Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and are funded by a legislation endorsed by Michelle Obama called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.
The new meals are based on USDA requirements that include serving more whole grains, daily doses of fruits and vegetables, less sugar and salt, and only low-fat or non-fat milk. The portions of each meal have also been reduced, limiting the amount of calories high school students eat during lunch to just 850 calories. 
Nick Blohm, a football student at Mukwonago High, told the Journal Sentinel that the quality of the food is not the problem so much as its portion size. 
“A lot of us are starting to get hungry even before the [football] practice begins,” he said. “Our metabolisms are all sped up.” 
Some school officials are also upset with the new changes. While students and staff members agree that childhood obesity is a major problem, the abruptness of the change in diet is problematic.
“I could not be more passionate about this,” Pam Harris, the Mukwonago district food service supervisor and registered dietician, told the Journal Sentinel. “I want to solve this problem. But limiting calories in school lunch is not going to help the overweight kid. What happens at home is a major piece of the puzzle.”
