Embracing cultural diversity in Korea
The number of multiracial students has soared domestically, according to a recent survey. 
The survey by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology showed that the number of students from interracial families has reached 46,954 this year, up 21 percent from a year earlier. The number is a fivefold spike from 9,389 in 2006.
The figure accounts for 0.7 percent of all primary and secondary school students in Korea. “If the current trend continues, multiracial students will represent more than 1 percent of the country’s primary and secondary school students by 2014,” the education ministry predicted.
In regards to nationality of the students’ parents, China topped the list with 33.8 percent, followed by Japan with 27.5 percent, the Philippines with 16.1 percent and Vietnam with 7.3 percent.
The survey was carried out by the Korean Education Development Institute on 11,390 elementary, middle and high schools nationwide.
As of last year, there were about 250,000 interracial families in Korea, says the ministry. Yet the upward trend in the number of multiracial family and children in the country has brought up hordes of societal problems.
Nearly 40 percent of the students from multiracial families drop out of school. They face bullying in the school environment and have to overcome poverty at home. 
To counter this, the government has come up with a number of measures to help these children adapt better both at school and in society. One of them is to offer Korean language and culture classes. 
However, the society where cultural diversity can be accepted without prejudice is most urgently needed.
