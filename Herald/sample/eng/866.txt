‘Bourne’ series returns with one notable exception
The highly successful “Bourne” film series returned this summer with its fourth installment, “The Bourne Legacy.” Fans, however, were quick to notice that this latest film was missing one key feature of the beloved “Bourne” series: actor Matt Damon as the title character, Jason Bourne. 
The latest “Bourne” installment continues along the storyline of a covert agent trying to defect from a secret government organization. Instead of featuring Jason Bourne, however, the film follows the plot of “The Bourne Ultimatum” from the perspective of Bourne’s fellow covert agent, Aaron Cross (Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner). 
In “The Bourne Ultimatum,” Bourne successfully takes down the secret government organization responsible for his creation, after a journalist gets killed while working on a story about sinister C.I.A. operations. “The Bourne Legacy” runs concurrently with this plot, where another of the C.I.A.’s clandestine operations – Operation Outcome – comes in danger of becoming compromised, after Operation Blackbriar and the Treadstone Project are publicly exposed.
When retired Air Force colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) discovers a potentially damaging video that implicates a connection between the Treadstone Project and Operation Outcome, he decides to “burn the program to the ground.” As it does in the world of covert operations, this means getting rid of any and all agents out in the field. When Cross realizes that his superiors have ordered his assassination, he fakes his death and attempts to find a way to survive and be left alone. 
Full of heart-pumping action and incredible chase sequences throughout Manila, “The Bourne Legacy” does not disappoint; it may, however, be more accurate to see this film as a spin-off rather than a sequel.
