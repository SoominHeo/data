Tourism body announces 99 hot spots
The Korea Tourism Organization (KTO), the national tourism body, in conjuction with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, recently released a list of 99 hot tourist spots.
These spots named “99 domestic places Koreans should visit” were designated according to their level of recognition and appeal, following meticulous surveys and planning.
To narrow down the list, the Culture Ministry conducted the first round of analysis of domestic tourism spots posted on the KTO website (korean.visitkorea.or.kr), called “here and there of Korea.”
Then, the KTO sought advice from travel experts and journalists to come up with 150 tourist attractions to be considered for a final list.
Finally, a professional panel of experts drew a list of the 99 places that travelers should not miss out on.
Here are brief introductions of two such attractions in Seoul, and more stories are to come in the upcoming “Travel” page in the newspaper.
Insa-dong in Seoul
Home to numerous galleries and antique shops, Insa-dong branches out into all directions from one main street. KTO suggests that travelers get a map of Insa-dong to explore the beauty of its side alleys. It adds that galleries in this area display and sell modern art pieces as well as antiques. It is said that about half of the nation‘s antique stores are here in Insa-dong.
N Seoul Tower
The tower opened to the public in 1980 and has since become a major tourist attraction. The 236.7-meter-tall N Seoul Tower sits atop Namsan mountain (243 m) and offers panoramic views of Seoul and the surrounding areas. At the base of Seoul Tower, visitors can find the Media Zone, a Pavilion Experience Hall, exhibition rooms and performance halls.
