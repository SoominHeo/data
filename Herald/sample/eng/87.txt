Vacuum up the cosmic junk!
The National Research Council, an independent organization that provides advice to the U.S. government on science matters, released a report on Sept. 2 that the space junk that orbits the Earth urgently needed clearing up. 
It said that Earth’s orbit was littered with garbage and a complete clean up using special tools such as nets, magnets, harpoons, tethers, giant dishes or umbrella-shaped devices should take place. 
There are about 22,000 objects in orbit and they could damage manned spaceships and satellites in space. The report added that the International Space Station had been badly affected by these debris.
 “We’ve lost control of the environment,” Donald Kessler, retired senior NASA scientist who headed the National Academy of Sciences said.
 It has been over 50 years since the space age began, and people have poured junk into the cosmos, throwing away old and rusty parts of spaceships and satellites. 
Scientists, though, have tried to reduce the space litter by burning it up or pulling it back to Earth, and in fact, the plans had paid off until recently. However, when Chinese government held an anti-satellite weapons test in 2007 and a crash between two satellites in the Earth’s orbit in 2009 broke out, the situation got drearier. 
The National Research Council’s report explained that the two tragedies have put a lot of new junk into the space. It said that during China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon test, Chinese used missiles to smash their aging weather satellite into pieces, and with that 150,000 new chunks of debris were created. 
“Those two single events doubled the amount of fragments in Earth’s orbit,” Kessler said. His concluding message was that the current cosmic situation calls for a full-scale vacuuming of the junk surrounding the Earth.
