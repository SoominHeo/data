Iran’s currency crisis
Political protests have escalated in the capital of Iran over steep fall in the country’s currency, the rial. 
Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who gathered outside the central bank district, chanting anti-government slogans. They called for the President Ahmadinejad regime to step down.
The rial has plummeted to record lows against the U.S. dollar.
The public blame Ahmadinejad for financial mismanagement and inefficiency in the nation’s currency crisis. 
“The Iranian government is under fire for the lack of direction in the crisis,” which aggravated price instability, BBC News reports. “This has made trading almost impossible inside this nation.”
“I work in the main hospital in the city and we are encountering some serious problems. We can’t buy necessary medication because prices go up by 70 percent a day,” one Iranian woman told a foreign media outlet. 
The government had closed currency exchange shops and rounded up illegal money changers, a senior Iranian police officer noted. Shops in the central Grand Bazaar have shut down doors in fear of security. Windows of some shops had already been shattered. 
Yet, Ahmadinejad has blamed Western sanctions for the fall in the rial, saying it amounts to an “economic war.” 
The U.S. economic sanctions are targeted toward repressing Iran’s controversial nuclear program, but the Iranian government should bear responsibility for what was happening inside Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued.
“Of course the sanctions have had an impact as well, but those could be remedied in short order if the Iranian government were willing to work with the international community in a sincere manner,” she pointed out.
