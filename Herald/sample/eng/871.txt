17th Busan International Film Festival kicks off
With its founding in 1996, the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) has grown to become one of Asia’s largest film festivals. This year’s Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) opens from Oct. 4-13, in the country’s port city of Busan.
In the 10-day film festival, 304 films from 75 countries, including 93 world premieres, are featured with a renewed focus on Asian diversity. 
A Hong Kong crime thriller about a battle between police and gangsters, “Cold War,” was the opening film at the festival.
The movie, directed by Sunny Luk and Longman Leung, revolves around two high-ranking police rivals and talks about their struggle to resolve a kidnapping case in Hong Kong. 
The movie touches on diverse human issues such as religion, the generation gap, and family love. It features big names in the Chinese movie industry, such as Aaron Kwok, Tony Leung Ka-fai and Andy Lau.
Asian stars made up most of the foreign guest list this year, according to the festival’s organizer.
Chinese actresses Tang Wei was one of them. She was chosen to host the festival’s opening ceremony; the first non-Korean to do so.
Among the renowned Western actresses coming to the festival are Victoria Abril of Spain, Agnes Jaoui of France, Teresa Palmer of Australia, Amanda Plummer of the U.S. and Alba Rohrwacher of Italy.
The success of the international film festival has solidified Busan as the host city of Asia’s largest film festival. 
The Metropolitan Government of Busan announced that it will set up research facilities and a large-scale studio complex along with state-of-the-art movie sets and accommodations to refurbish Busan as an international film hub and a major global tourist attraction. Some 50 billion won in funds is expected to be raised by 2018 to promote the industry, city officials noted.
