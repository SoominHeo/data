Using viruses to help fight against acne
Scientists believe that a harmless virus that lives on our skin can be used as a treatment for every teenager’s worst nightmare: acne. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, acne is caused when hair follicles become blocked with oil and dead skin cells, which then gets contaminated and infected by normally harmless bacteria, such as Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). 
Experts at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Pittsburgh found 11 types of viruses, called phages, that live on our skin and are naturally designed to target and kill the acne-causing bacteria. This is found to be done through the protein endolysin. In a press release, the scientists stated that the 11 viruses make endolysin, which breaks down the P. acne bacteria before killing it. 
Scientists hope to develop these viruses into a more effective treatment to help fight acne. 
Current treatments for acne typically use antibiotics, which tend to kill many types of bacteria, including “good” ones that play an important role in our bodies’ immune system. Other problems with current treatments for acne include drug resistance and side effects.
“Antibiotics such as tetracycline are so widely used that many acne strains have developed resistance,” co-researcher Dr. Jenny Kim, director of the UCLA Clinic for Acne, Rosacea and Aesthetics, was quoted as saying by BBC News. 
“Drugs like Accutane, while effective, can produce risky side effects, limiting their use” Kim added. 
“Acne affects millions of people, yet we have few treatments that are both safe and effective,” lead scientist, professor Robert Modlin, was quoted as saying by BBC News. 
“Harnessing a virus that naturally preys on the bacteria that causes pimples could offer a promising new tool against the physical and emotional scars of severe acne.“
