Psy’s ’Gangnam Style' conquers global music charts
 “Gangnam Style,” a song by eccentric Korean singer Psy has made the No. 2 spot in the Billboard chart on Oct. 3, the first to do so in K-pop’s history. 
The song stayed behind only by Maroon 5’s “One More Night” for the second consecutive week in the Billboard Hot 100, the Billboard.com announced.
The company noted that “the race between the two artists was extremely close, less than 500 overall chart points.” Maroon 5’s lead resulted from its frequent radio airplay. 
“Gangnam Style” also went viral in England, becoming the No.1 on the British Official Singles Chart on Oct. 1. 
“He’s done it! Gangnam Style fever has swept the globe this month and today officially conquers the U.K., galloping all the way to No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart,” the company said on its website. 
“He’s just less than tops on the chart, he’ll have to keep his shirt on,” Billboard.com commented. Psy has earlier pledged to perform topless if Gangnam Style makes the No. 1 on Billboard.
Still, the 2nd spot could not stop Psy’s passion for “having a blast” with his local fans.
He decided to go ahead with the plan and took his shirt off and danced along the YouTube hit, “Gangnam Style” in front of tens of thousands of people in Seoul Plaza on Oct. 4. 
The catchy song with its famous horse-riding dance has so far obtained more than 400 million YouTube plays.
