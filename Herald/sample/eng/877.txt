Young Filipino filmmaker enters Pyongyang International Film Festival
A multi-award winning young Filipino filmmaker has managed to achieve a level of exposure that many would never have dreamt possible; the chance to tell a story to a North Korean audience. 
Nash Ang, a Filipino filmmaker currently based in Seoul, was chosen to take part in the 13th Pyongyang International Film Festival (Sept. 20-27) with his hour-long documentary called, “Live To Dive.” 
In “Live To Dive,” Ang tells the heartbreaking yet beautifully presented story of life at poverty-stricken Puting Bato in the Philippines. Ang tells the story from the perspective of 11-year-old Totoy and 10-year-old Pirot, who dive into severely polluted waters to retrieve plastic bottles or pieces of metal and fish to help earn money for and feed their families. Totoy and Pirot represent the children of Puting Bato, to whom such scraps of garbage become the difference between eating that day and going hungry. 
“Some people in the Philippines are not aware of the extreme poverty that exists there,” Ang said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I am not sure I have anything specific in mind, but I expect the initial reaction from people who see the film to be a feeling of pity.” 
Ang’s cinematic skill in capturing the essence of poverty has earned him numerous awards and accolades. After his other film, “Water Ghetto” was screened at the DMZ Korean International Documentary Film Festival last year, Ang received a full scholarship to the prestigious Korea National University of Arts, where he is currently pursuing a masters in filmmaking, with a major in directing.
