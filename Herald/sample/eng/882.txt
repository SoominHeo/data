Hangeul wins 2nd World Alphabet Olympics
The writing system of Korean alphabet, Hangeul, has won the gold medal at an international world alphabet contest, the organizing committee of the competition in Seoul announced.
Hangeul earned the top honor at the 2nd World Alphabet Olympics in Bangkok, beating India’s Telugu alphabet and the English alphabet.
Scholars from 27 countries either with their own writing system or using borrowed alphabets from other nations participated in the contest, the organizers noted.
It is second straight win for Hangeul since 2009, when the first World Alphabet Olympics was opened in Seoul. Three years ago, Greece and Italy won silver and bronze medals among the 16 countries with their own alphabets. 
Lee Yang-ha, the chief organizer of the event and a former South Korean ambassador to Lebanon praised Hangeul as “superior to all other alphabets in its ability to convey information in a short period of time.”
“While 26 letters of the English alphabet can only express 300 or more sorts of sound, 24 letters of the Korean alphabet can make 11,000 kinds of sound in theory and 8,700 sorts of sound in practice,” she added.
On the last day of the event, participating scholars adopted a statement called “Bangkok Declaration,” in which they pledged to make their best efforts in promoting and developing the Korean alphabet across the globe. They also organized the World Alphabet Society in order to carry on their activities.
