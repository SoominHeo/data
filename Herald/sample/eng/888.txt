‘Frankenweenie’
Director Tim Burton returns to the big screen with a feature-length remake of his earlier film of the same name, “Frankenweenie.” A homage to the 1931 film “Frankenstein,” “Frankenweenie” is a 3-D stop motion, black and white science-fiction film about a young boy named Victor (Charlie Tahan) and his pet dog, Sparky.
Like most of Burton’s films, “Frankenweenie” is full of his usual gothic style and dark humor, which is accentuated with the use of black and white cinematography.
The story itself is fairly simple yet personal. Although full of references to classic horror films, in its essence “Frankenweenie” is about a boy named Victor Frankenstein and his best friend and dog, Sparky. 
As an avid filmmaker and a budding scientist, Victor spends most of his days in his room making home movies starring toys, models and best friend, Sparky. When Sparky dies in a tragic accident, a grief-stricken Victor falls into depression. Soon, however, Victor finds inspiration from an in-class demonstration of the effect of electricity on dead frogs by his science teacher, Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau). 
Sad and a little hopeful, Victor digs up Sparky’s corpse, bringing it into his makeshift laboratory in the attic, where he successfully reanimates his dog with lightning. Happy to be reunited with his best friend, Victor begins to celebrate only to be blackmailed into showing his hunchbacked-classmate, Edgar (Atticus Shaffer), how he brought Sparky back to life. As more and more people begin to learn of Victor’s secret reanimation formula, more and more once-dead pets are brought back to life, wreaking havoc in the town. 
Will Victor and Sparky get in trouble for the problems they have caused? Or will they be able to set things right before it’s too late?
