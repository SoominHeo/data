 Paintings stolen from Dutch museum
Thieves stole seven priceless paintings by Picasso, Monet, Gauguin, Matisse and Lucian Freud from an art museum in the Netherlands on the night of Oct. 16. 
The Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam, the Netherlands was exhibiting a private collection owned by the Triton Foundation to celebrate the gallery’s 20th birthday. 
Police investigators said the burglary happened at about 3 a.m. Though an emergency alarm went off and police arrived within five minutes of the incident, the thieves had already vanished. 
The stolen paintings include: Meyer de Haan’s “Self-Portrait” of 1890 and Gauguin’s 1898 “Girl in Front of Open Window”; Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge, London” and “Charing Cross Bridge, London,” both from 1901; Matisse’s 1919 “Reading Girl in White and Yellow”; Picasso’s 1971 “Harlequin Head”; and Freud’s haunting 2002 portrait “Woman With Eyes Closed.” Art experts estimated the value of the stolen works to be worth possibly hundreds of millions of dollars.
The theft “was carefully thought out, cleverly conceived and it was quickly executed, so that suggests professionals,” Charles Hill, a former Scotland Yard art detective stated. He previously worked for an undercover operation to retrieve a version of “The Scream,” by Edvard Munch, after it was stolen in 1994 in Oslo. 
Europe has been gaining notoriety as a hunting ground for art theft. In 2010, five paintings, including a Picasso and a Matisse, estimated at about $130 million altogether, were stolen from the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris. They are still missing. 
The museum’s director, Emily Ansenk, said the burglary “has hit the art world like a bomb” and described it “as a nightmare for any museum director.” The museum has since been closed to the public for further investigation of the case.
