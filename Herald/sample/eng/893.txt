The 3rd Korea-Africa Forum
Korea and a group of African countries have agreed to boost bilateral exchanges and cooperation at the third Korea-Africa Forum in Seoul. 
Co-hosted by the Korean government and the African Union (AU) Commission, participants at the forum exchanged their ideas on a wide range of global issues from development assistance, trade and investment to peace and security. 
A joint declaration was adopted by the two sides, with Seoul vowing to expand its official development assistance (ODA) to Africa. The government pledged to establish a training center in Ethiopia and provide financial support for the AU’s Peace Fund, the Foreign Ministry said.
The forum, the third of its kind, attracted some 150 high-ranking officials and other delegates from 18 African nations and international organizations on Oct. 17. High-profile participants included Michael Sata, the president of Zambia. 
“The African countries have achieved an average of 4.8 percent of economic growth each year since 2000, which is evidence that it is now transforming into a land of hope and promise,” Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said during the welcoming speech. “Now is time to bring Korea-Africa relations a notch higher. I am sure that the enhanced bilateral relations will bring about mutual prosperity.”
“Korea has been striving to share its experiences and knowledge for economic growth with African countries,” Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan noted during the opening ceremony. 
Korea has about 1,000 aid volunteers in Africa and this year, its development assistance to the continent is expected to be double the level of 2008.
The Korea-Africa Forum was launched by former President Roh Moo-hyun during his trip to Africa in 2006. It has since been held every three years.
