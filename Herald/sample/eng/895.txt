Korea to focus on commercializing robots
The nation’s focus of policy for the robot industry will shift to commercialization from research and development (R&D), the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said on Oct. 17. 
The new policy direction was unveiled in the ministry’s announcement of a roadmap for the robot industry. 
The event was attended by Knowledge Economy Minister Hong Suk-woo and some 300 domestic robot experts.
“One of the key points in the future robot policy is to support various sectors, public or private, to adopt and use robots in their daily work,” Kang Kam-chan, a ministry official, said. 
The roadmap aims to make Korea a country where robots become part of daily life and where the markets for robotics industry will also boom, the ministry said.
The ministry has supported robot-related R&D projects since 2005, when it designated intelligence robotics as one of the nation’s new growth engines. Under the new policy direction, the ministry’s R&D investment will also seek projects to commercialize robots.
Four R&D projects that the ministry promised to allocate 350 billion won for are the development of a robot to deal with natural disasters, a robot-driven health town development, a human-robot collaborative plant and a human-friendly robot to support housework. 
“In the second stage, the private sector will lead the robot industry,” Kang said. 
When those projects take shape, the ministry will encourage market participants to reshape their robot businesses into the service and content industry.
The ministry pinpointed auto, medical, defense and education industries as four major areas where such technological fusion with robotics will take place.
Based on the new roadmap, the ministry predicted that the nation’s robot market will be able to expand up to 25 trillion won by 2022 from 2 trillion won in 2011.
