Korean learning booming in Africa
A state-owned television channel in Egypt has begun broadcasting a language program taught by a Korean professor.
Oh Se-jong, a Korean language professor at the Cairo-based Ain Shams University, has been teaching Korean to locals since the program’s launch at the beginning of September. “More than 500 people have already introduced the course on their Facebook accounts or started to follow it on Twitter,” Oh pointed out. “The producer in charge of the Korean language course has told me that the program is popular in Egypt.”
The beginner Korean language course is made up of 20 lessons, with each episode playing twice a day during the weekend, an education channel owned by the Nile Television Network in Egypt said. 
The educational channel has an estimated 13 million viewers in the country and a wide range of viewers in other Arabic-speaking nations such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Libya.
“I think most Egyptians who are interested in the Korean language watch the program,” a 35-year-old language student said. “It‘s really interesting and easy to understand.”
The program’s popularity has augmented interest in Korean language among many Egyptians.
Officials at the South Korean Embassy in Cairo noted that they expect the TV course to help the spread of Korean pop culture, known as “hallyu,” across northern Africa and the Middle East. Already applications for free language lessons at the embassy have increased. Egyptian universities have also started to add Korean major courses.
