Waves of destruction
A powerful earthquake struck the coast of Chile in 1960. Many people were frightened and got into their boats in the harbor to escape the disaster. Soon enormous waves caused by the earthquake rose up from the ocean. These violent waves, each more than three stories high, destroyed all the boats and killed the people in them. The waves then traveled for 15 hours across the Pacific Ocean to Hilo in Hawaii, where they destroyed more property.
 These waves are known as “tsunamis,” from the Japanese for “harbor wave.”
 A tsunami is a large destructive wave created by the shock from an earthquake or volcanic eruption. The impact of a meteorite could also create a tsunami. Tsunamis travel fast and have the force to destroy entire coastal communities within moments.
 A tsunami can travel at speeds of 720 kilometers an hour or more (as fast as a jet plane) and packs tremendous force. As the tsunami approaches land, it grows larger. It continues to travel until its energy is completely used up. All low-lying coastal areas are vulnerable to tsunamis.
 In December 2004 an earthquake caused a major tsunami in the Indian Ocean. The earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia. Two hours later, waves as high as 10 meters devastated coastal areas some 1,200 kilometers away. The tsunami killed more than 200,000 people in at least 10 countries.
