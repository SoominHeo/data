Dark faces of energy drinks
There have been reports of five deaths and a heart attack associated with energy drinks in the United States. 
In December, 2011, a 14-year-old teenage girl, Anais Fournier, died with her twin brother Dorian after drinking Monster Energy for two days in a row. Her mother filed a lawsuit against the drink’s maker, Monster Beverage. 
Wendy Crossland of Hagerstown, Maryland, the children’s mother, said that she “wanted to do everything in her power to make sure young people don’t drink energy drinks,” according to her attorney, Kevin Goldberg.
However, the Monster Beverage insisted in a statement that the company’s Energy drinks “have always been safe” and it does not believe that its products have anything to do with Fournier’s death.
A 15-year-old boy, Brian, also died of a heart arrhythmia after drinking a free sample of Red Bull energy drink in 2008. Jim Shepherd of Toronto, the boy’s father, has since been an outspoken opponent of all energy drinks. 
Still, the company of the maker, Red Bull insisted that even though it sympathizes with his son’s death, it does not believe that the drink was responsible for the death. 
The tragic incidents have nudged the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)into bolstering regulations on highly caffeinated drinks.
The deaths could lead to FDA action on energy drinks, health and safety advocates suggest. “Sometimes, tragedy prompts action as they put a face and voice to a very severe danger,” they said.
The spokeswoman of the Food & Drug Administration Shelly Burgess commented on Oct. 23 that the agency will “take these incidents seriously, and investigate each report diligently.”
