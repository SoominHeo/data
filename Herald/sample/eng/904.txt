Korea elected to U.N. Security Council
Korea became the non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council on Oct. 18.
Korea’s election reflects its elevated influence in the global community and renewed responsibility in the world’s security challenges, particularly the North Korea issue.
Korea competed against Cambodia and Bhutan for one vacant non-permanent member seat offered for the Asia-Pacific category.
It is the second time that Korea took the temporary seat in the international organization. It served the first term in 1996-97. 
The Security Council is the U.N.’s top decision-making body, with its noble mission of maintaining world peace.
“If the first term provided lessons on U.N. diplomacy, now is the stage for Korea to show maturity in quality and quantity,” noted Kim Sook, Seoul’s ambassador to the U.N. “It would serve as a chance to solidify the stature as a middle power in the international community and expand substantial contributions.”
Four other nations - Rwanda, Argentina, Australia, and Luxembourg - were also made new members in the Security Council.
Welcoming the new members into the group, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said, “We look forward to a strong and productive partnership with these incoming members to address issues fundamental to international peace and security, including nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, conflict prevention and resolution, promotion of democracy and human rights, and the oversight of complex U.N. field operations.” 
“Korea will be able to take leading part in the U.N.’s efforts for world peace and security and holding a seat again on the Security Council is also expected to contribute to the stable management of situations on the Korean Peninsula,” Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Starting Jan. 1, Korea will serve as a member of the 15-nation council for two years. Members of the council will hold the rotating presidency beginning February in alphabetical order.
