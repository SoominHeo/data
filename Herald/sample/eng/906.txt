Apple releases smaller tablets, sensing competition
Steve Jobs once poked fun at tablets with small screens, but his own company has come up with a shrink version of the previous 9.7-inch tablet.
At its press event held on Oct. 23, local time in California, the United States, Apple unveiled its iPad Mini and praised it as “thinner, lighter and more durable” than other tablets.
Apple’s iPad mini weighs about two-thirds of a pound and has a screen size of 7.9 inches diagonally, making it significantly smaller than the predecessor.
Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s vice president for marketing suggested that the smaller, lighter tablet would be appealing for people who want something more portable, possibly female consumers. “It can more easily fit in a purse,” he said.
It may also offer a bigger opportunity for Apple in developing countries like China and India thanks to its more affordable price. The lowest price for the Mini iPad is $330.
The smaller iPad is a bit of a shift for the company, insider sources viewed.
Jobs once said that competitors’ 7-inch tablets were too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with the company’s iPad. 
But lately, smaller models have become impossible to ignore. Google recently released its 7-inch Nexus 7 tablet for $200. Amazon introduced a 7-inch tablet for $160. Barnes & Noble’s Nook tablet, which starts at $200, has been selling fairly well. In total, the three have sold some 15 million of the smaller, cheaper tablets, reports The New York Times. 
Apple still dominates the tablet market. It has reportedly sold 100 million iPads to date. Yet, sensing the competition, the company has jumped on the bandwagon and released the new gadget. 
The iPad Mini includes all functions of Apple’s other mobile devices, such as Lightning connector and a five-megapixel camera. However, it does not have the high-resolution Retina display to keep it thinner and lighter, the company claimed.
