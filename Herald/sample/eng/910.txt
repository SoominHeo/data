James Bond returns in ‘Skyfall’
 “Skyfall,” which opened in theaters across the nation on Oct. 26, features Daniel Craig reprising his role as Bond... James Bond. 
Directed by Sam Mendes, “Skyfall” may be missing the many high-tech gadgets we have come to associate with MI6, but it has no shortage of heart-pumping action and silver-tongued dialogue we’ve come to expect from Agent 007. 
The plot of “Skyfall” focuses on testing James Bond’s loyalty to the head of MI6, M, when her past comes back to haunt her in the form of an ex-MI6 agent. As MI6 comes under attack, she must also face pressure from the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, who demands her resignation. 
Craig’s Bond in “Skyfall” is a different take on the seemingly indestructible and ageless Agent 007. He is older; more careworn. Craig’s portrayal of a world-weary Bond is both refreshing and honest. His scene with Q (Ben Whishaw), the young, tech-savvy head of research and development at MI6, for example, is hilarious yet understated in its portrayal of the generational gap in understanding and appreciating the subtleties of technology. 
Craig, however, isn’t the only actor to watch out for in this installment of the James Bond series. Javier Bardem and Judi Dench are also spectacular in their respective portrayals of Raoul Silva and M. 
M goes through more character development in “Skyfall” than any of the other recent James Bond series. In this latest film, we see Dench’s character undergo some tough, personal struggles as her past actions come back to haunt her. The enigmatic head of MI6 must face the unfortunate consequences of being in charge. 
Raoul Silva is the antagonist of “Skyfall.” A former MI6 agent turned cyber-terrorist, Silva makes it his mission to take revenge against those he considers to have betrayed him. Bardem’s portrayal of the obsessed -- and at times psychotic -- Silva is more than terrifying and definitely worth watching.
