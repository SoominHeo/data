Festival in Gangneung allures coffee lovers
There are more than 160 coffee houses in the east coast city of Gangneung, population 280,000. 
Normally Gangneung is a popular summer spot, attracting more than 200,000 holidaymakers during the peak summer season to its famous Gyeongpodae Beach. So it is natural that the city came up with a festival to bring in more tourists outside of the summer. This year the Gangneung Coffee Festival was held at the port city through Oct. 28. 
Visitors could start their journey at the Coffee Museum, where coffee trees are planted and people can see the beans harvested. They could also see an exhibition of Korean coffee history alongside beans from all over the world and later taste Americano and other beverages.
A contest for aspiring baristas was held and attracted local residents and curious youths who bought roasted beans or ground coffee as well as handmade cookies and other treats. 
For environmentally conscious people, a bicycle-rental program was available: People rented bicycles for free and received coupons for a free cup of coffee at designated cafes -- when arriving by bike. 
The roads were full of people around the coffee houses alongside the shore of Gangneung Port. When tired, they could drop by at any of the coffee houses nearby, sit down for a cup of coffee with ice cream and spend the rest of the day chatting. 
The festival all started with barista Park I-choo, who moved to Gangneung in 2001 and opened a roasting house after a successful career as a coffee maker in Seoul for over a decade. His sophisticated handling of the beans and tools put the neighboring areas, which used to be filled with sashimi houses, bustling with coffee lovers from across Gangwon Province, and also put Gangneung on the tourist map even outside of the summer season.
