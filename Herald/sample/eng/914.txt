Europe’s oldest prehistoric town unearthed in Bulgaria
The oldest prehistoric town in Europe’s history to date has been uncovered near Provadia, a town in northeastern Bulgaria. 
According to archaeologists in Bulgaria, a site featuring two-storey houses and defensive walls has been found. They claimed that the settlement near the modern town of Provadia was home to some 350 people and was thought to have been an important site for salt production. 
Inside the town, residents boiled water from a local spring and used it to create salt bricks. Then the bricks were traded and used to preserve meat, making salt an extremely valuable commodity at the time. This is why experts argue that there were huge defensive stone walls stoutly surrounding the town.
The town dates back to between B.C. 4700 and 4200, about 1,500 years before the start of ancient Greek civilization, the researchers suggested.
According to AFP, the discovery of the town may also give significant clues about the treasure found four decades ago at a nearby cemetery on the outskirts of Varna, which was the oldest hoard of gold objects found anywhere in the world. 
Excavations of the site began in 2005. So far, some remains of two-storey houses, such as pits used for rituals and parts of a gate and bastion structures have been unearthed. A small necropolis, or burial ground, was discovered at the site earlier this year as well.
“The latest find was extremely interesting,” Vasil Nikolov, a researcher with Bulgaria’s National Institute of Archaeology told AFP. “The huge walls around the settlement, which were built very tall and with stone blocks ... are also something unseen in excavations of prehistoric sites in southeastern Europe so far,” he noted.
