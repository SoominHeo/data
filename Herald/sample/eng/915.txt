English ‘Arirang’ book published
An English book on the history and development of the traditional Korean folk song, “Arirang,” has been written by a local scholar, Yonhap News said. 
“The Culture of Arirang,” originally written in Korean, was translated into English last month, said Kim Yeon-gap, the author of the book and the executive director of the private Korean Arirang Association. The English edition was translated by Ki Mee-yang and Lee Jung-ha and published by Jimoondang, a South Korean publishing house.
The book thoroughly illustrates how the song Arirang was born and developed into a part of Korea’s folk culture, Kim says.
“UNESCO is to discuss whether to register Arirang as an intangible cultural heritage this December. In that sense, I tried to contain everything we know about Arirang in the book, because when it is on the UNESCO list, I can properly answer all the questions that foreigners have.” 
Kim, who has been studying the folk song for more than 30 years, claimed that Arirang should be considered as Korean culture.
”Arirang is not merely a song but an independent genre and a culture that holds the three major spirits of Korea: resistance, unity and co-existence,” he said. 
The author added that he plans to distribute the book overseas via the Korea Foundation affiliated with Seoul‘s Foreign Ministry, so that international readers can learn about the true beauty of Korea’s traditional culture, “Arirang.”
The English version of “Arirang” is now available on online bookstores across Korea.
