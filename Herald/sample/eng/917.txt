Bananas may replace potatoes in future food market
Bananas could take the place of potatoes in food market in some developing countries, researchers at the CGIAR agricultural partnership argued.
Climate change may make bananas a critical food source for millions of people in the near future, replacing other major agricultural commodities.
The United Nations’ committee on world food security has studied the potential impact of climate change on world’s 22 most significant crops. 
The report showed that wheat, one of world‘s three biggest crops in terms of calories provided, is likely to face a harsh future in the developing world as more lucrative commodities, such as cotton, push the production of wheat to marginal land, making it more vulnerable to volatile weather conditions and climate change.
Potatoes, another major crop, grow best in cooler climates; therefore, it may suffer more heavily at higher temperatures. 
Yet, there is a silver lining. The changes can provide a way for bananas to substitute wheat, potatoes and other endangered crops in future food market.
Bananas are “not necessarily a silver bullet, but in places where temperatures increase, they might be one option that small-holders could start to look at,” Dr Philip Thornton lead author of the report told BBC News.
BBC News points out that all people need to do is to adjust to new diets and tackle the protein deficiency problem that comes along with this new way of eating.
“Two decades ago there was almost no rice consumption in certain areas of Africa, now there is. People have changed because it’s easier to get, it‘s easier to cook. I think those sort of shifts do occur and I think they will in future,” Bruce Campbell, program director of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security research group (CCAFS) said.
