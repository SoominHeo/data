Film based on true story becomes box office hit
Argo, an American thriller film based on a true story, was released in theaters nationwide on Oct. 31.
The film is about the real-life story of the former CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) operative Tony Mendez‘s mission to rescue six U.S. diplomats in Iran during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.
Directed by a well-known Hollywood actor, Ben Affleck and co-produced by another Hollywood heart-throb George Clooney, “Argo” was released in its home turf on Oct.12. 
Militants storm the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979 and abducted most of embassy officials there. With luck, six diplomats managed to escape from the site and hide in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (played by Victor Garber). 
Then the “Argo” mission to bring these diplomats out of Iran begins. 
CIA specialist Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) makes up a fake story about filming a non-existing fantasy film, “Argo” in Tehran. He gives the six escapees phony Canadian identities to disguise them as Canadian filmmakers. 
After the mission was completed, the real-life Mendez was awarded with the Intelligence Star by the U.S. This highly classified mission did not go public until 1997.
Though the movie received both critical and commercial success, it has been criticized for its twisting of the true incident. In reality, the Canadian ambassador, not a CIA operative, played a more significant role in the release of the abductees. Yet the film glorified the U.S.’ contribution to this legendary task. 
Some of the scenes never even happened. The suspense-filled ticketing scene at the airport in fact did not exist, as ticketing was completed well before their arrival.
