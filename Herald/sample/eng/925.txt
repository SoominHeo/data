China opens national party congress
China opened the 18th National Congress of the ruling communist party on Nov. 8. 
The National Congress, held every five years, is deemed the country’s most significant political meeting. This is because Beijing’s next group of leaders is selected there. 
The opening ceremony of the 18th National Congress was held at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. 
The event was broadcast live by the state-run broadcaster, CCTV. Former President Jiang Zemin attended the event.
The newly formed, the fifth generation of the Chinese leadership includes China’s well known politicians such as Vice President Xi Jinping and Vice Premier Li Keqiang. 
They will succeed outgoing ruling elites, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, beginning early next year, CCTV noted.
Seven people, including Xi and Li, will also make the next members of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, the most central political group in the nation’s ruling communist party.
During the week-long congress, a total of 2,270 delegates were elected. The major agenda for the congress was to hear and examine the report by the 17th Party Central Committee and to make corresponding changes to the Party’s Constitution.
The 18th Party Central Committee will convene its first session on Dec. 15.
In upcoming inauguration ceremony, Vice President Xi Jinping is expected to take over President Hu Jintao as party chief in Beijing’s much-wished and once a decade power transition.
