Hangeul Day to be celebrated as national holiday
Hangeul Day, which celebrates the creation of the Korean alphabet, is expected to be re-designated as a national holiday starting next year, said the Ministry of Public Administration and Security.
The invention and proclamation of the Korean alphabet came in 1446 and Hangeul Day was launched in 1924 as part of efforts to preserve the written language under the Japanese colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.
During the colonial rule, the use of Hangeul was banned.
Hangeul Day, which falls on Oct. 9, was designated an official holiday in 1949, four years after Korea was liberated from Japanese rule. However, in 1991 it lost its status as national holiday because the government thought that having too many holidays would hurt the economy.
The ministry said it would push for a relevant bill to allow Hangeul Day to be re-designated as a public holiday. If approved by the Cabinet, it will take effect starting next year.
The move has received strong support from a majority of Koreans, according to the ministry.
In a telephone survey conducted by the Culture Ministry in April, 83.6 percent of 1,000 citizens aged 19 or older supported designating Hangeul Day as a holiday. The percentage of supporters in 2009 was 68.8 percent and 76.3 percent in 2011.
Those who supported the idea said that the change would bring positive economic effects, such as improvement in labor productivity caused by rest and sightseeing (33.7 percent), vitalization of domestic consumption (21.3 percent) and job creation (13.9 percent).
In terms of social and cultural aspects, 45.9 percent responded that it would elevate public pride in the Korean alphabet. Some 34.2 percent said it would improve the national brand and help spread Korean culture, and 14 percent replied that a holiday would lead to higher quality of life.
If Hangeul Day is re-designated as public holiday, the number of official holidays for 2013 will grow to 15.
