Asian market raises BMW’s third quarter profit
A sales boom in Asia has pulled up third quarter pre-tax profits for German luxury car brand BMW to a record high.
The robust sales in Asia helped offset the global firm’s disappointing sales elsewhere caused by the prolonged global economic downturn, BBC News reported. 
The sales of the world’s largest luxury carmaker in China and Japan rose by 33 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively in the nine months to the end of September.
This created a 17.6 percent rise in pre-tax profit to 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) for the period between July and September for the company, the news report stated.
Unlike the impressive profit increases in Asia, sales in Europe rose merely 2.6 percent during the same period.
“We expect further sales volume growth for the fourth quarter, even though it is clear that we -and indeed the sector as a whole - are likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions,” said Norbert Reithofer, BMW chief executive.
BMW said it remained confident of meeting its full-year targets. In fact, the total sales of the company’s Rolls Royce and Mini brands were up 9 percent to 434,963 for the three months to the end of September.
Based on the prediction that the global economy will not deteriorate sharply in the near future, the chief executive of BMW forecasts that anticipating further pre-tax profit and sales records for the firm is not unreasonable. 
Still, Reithofer cautiously stated, “Like the rest of the sector, we are now beginning to feel some headwind.”
