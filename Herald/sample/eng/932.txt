'Now Is Good’
The last time that child star Dakota Fanning graced the silver screen was with her chilling performance as the powerful vampire Jane Volturi in the “Twilight” series. With the final installment of Twilight set to air later this year, Dakota Fanning has returned to the big screen in a role that is polar opposites from the terrifying Jane; that of a vulnerable 17-year-old girl from Brighton, England, in “Now Is Good.” 
“Now Is Good” is a heartbreaking tale of 17-year-old Tessa Scott whose time is running out. Dying of leukemia, Tessa and her family struggle with the reality that she will be dead soon. 
The tear-jerking film follows the life of Tessa as she attempts to make the most of what time she has left. Going against her father’s wishes, Tessa decides to stop receiving treatment for her leukemia. We watch as Tessa struggles to experience and accomplish as much as she can in the short time she has left. 
Though Fanning’s performance as a dying 17-year-old is interesting, some of the most tragic moments of the film come from watching Tessa’s family struggling to come to terms with her inevitable death. The younger brother, father and mother all grieve together but cope in very different ways.
As sad as the story is, however, the film actually has a great message about the fragility of life. Tessa struggles with something that most people take for granted -- time. Her story reminds us of the importance of moments; of cherishing every moment of your life as if it were your last and making the best of everything. 
“Now Is Good” opened in theaters across the nation on Nov. 8.
