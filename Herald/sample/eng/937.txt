Robots to help disabled with their education
SK Telecom, Korea’s largest mobile carrier, held an open class at a special school in Seoul, using the company’s smart education robot called “Albert.”
The company’s CEO Ha Sung-min and officials from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology visited Seoul Jungjun School, a special school for disabled children.
Unlike any other educational robots, Albert uses a smartphone port as its central processing unit, so the software programs running the robot are in the form of smartphone apps. According to SK Telecom, “Albert” uses Android operating system. 
The self-developed app is designed for robots to help disabled students with their education.
Today, SK Telecom is collaborating with industry experts to develop better software for smart robots. The company also runs contest and exhibits for app developers.
“Such philanthropy is part of its promotional campaign called ‘Relay of Possibility,’” the company stated. “The firm’s objective is to connect people with technology.”
It also launched a voice service for the visually impaired last year.
The company plans to expand its “Smart Learning” program by 2013 to support special schools. “We prepared the occasion in our wish for the students to overcome their disabilities for new possibilities,” said Ha. 
“As smart-bots are a promising educational platform with a high growth potential, we will keep investing in development while increasing marketing activities in and outside the country,” Park Chul-Soon, SK Telecom’s head of convergence said.
Designed as an educational solution, the smart-bot had been on display in the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in February and in the WIS 2012, Seoul, in May. Previously it was featured in the Yeosu Expo. It is now considered a role model for future robot business by Seoul’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy.
