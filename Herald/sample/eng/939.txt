Channing Tatum named hottest man of 2012
Channing Tatum has been named this year’s Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine.
According to Julie Jordan, People magazine’s senior writer, actor Channing Tatum is a combination of perfect body meets decent heart. “He’s the triple threat this year,” Jordan said while appearing on MSNBC’s Today show. “There was romance in ‘The Vow,’ there was comedy with ‘21 Jump Street’ and that little film ‘Magic Mike’…” 
The 32-year-old actor Tatum was surely one of Hollywood’s most prolific actors this year. Yet that was not the end. Movies he starred in also made it to the top of the box office rankings. “The Vow,” “21 Jump Street” and “Magic Mike” earned a collective $376 million at theaters. Four of his films are set to be released next year, the Today show revealed. 
Last year’s winner of the poll was Bradley Cooper. The selection of Cooper caused a huge backfire. Fans of the runner-up Ryan Gosling immediately set up a petition asking People to admit its mistake. But the magazine stood by their choice.
