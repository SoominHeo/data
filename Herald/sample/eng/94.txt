Korea, world’s most advanced info tech country
On Sept. 15, officials from the Korean government announced that South Korea was picked as the world’s most celebrated information and communication technology mecca.
 Citing a report made by International Telecommunications Union, the Korea Communications Commission remarked that Korea came on top of the 152 countries on the 2011 ICT Development Index list.
 In previous polls, Korea ranked third and second in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
 The ICT development level is evaluated by countries’ ICT access and use levels, the number of households with computers and broadband Internet users and their literacy rates.
 Sweden, which defended its No.1 spot for three straight years through 2010, ranked second and was followed by other European nations, including Iceland, Denmark and Finland.
