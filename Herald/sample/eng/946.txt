Obsession over ideal body threatens health of U.S. teens
According to a new report, the quest for the perfect body is putting more teenagers at risk in the United States. Experts say American boys as young as 14 are doing extreme weight-lifting and calorie-counting and this could adversely affect their development.
In the study published in Pediatrics, Marla Eisenberg, an assistant professor in pediatrics in the division of Adolescent Health and Medicine at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine and her colleagues surveyed adolescents from 20 middle schools and high schools in the St. Paul/Minneapolis area of Minnesota. 
In the study, more than 90 percent of boys and more than 80 percent of girls replied that they were exercising to add muscle or tone their muscles. Among the boys, 34.7 percent said they were consuming protein powders or shakes, 5.9 percent said they were using steroids, and 10.5 percent responded that they were using some other muscle enhancing substance. 
For teenage girls, around 21.2 percent responded that they were using protein powders or shakes, 4.6 percent said they were taking steroids, and 5.5 percent were using some other muscle enhancing substance, reported MSNBC News.
The study’s lead researcher, Marla Eisenberg, argues that exercise itself is not a bad thing but the problem arises when kids start using other methods to pump up their muscles. 
“The possibility that teens will turn to unhealthy methods to muscle up is troublesome,” said Eisenberg. 
The change in ideal female figure, from thin to toned, has added up to the “bulk up” trend, according to the study’s researchers. “Now more and more we’re seeing images of women who are not just slender, but also have toned and very fit looking (bodies).”
The prevalence of protein powders, shakes and steroid use among the U.S. teens is surprising, Eisenberg noted. “I hope that people will understand that fitness is a good thing, but you have to achieve it through healthy means.”
