Sales of Coca-Cola to resume in Myanmar
After almost 60 years, Coca-Cola goes on sale again in Myanmar, reports BBC News. 
Coca-Cola is the world’s most recognized brand, selling 1.8 billion servings of the drink every day around the world. So it is quite surprising to know that there are countries where the drink is not sold. 
For the last six decades, none has been sold in Myanmar. This is due to U.S. trade sanctions on the country’s military junta which ruled Myanmar from 1962 to 2011, says the report. Those sanctions were suspended a few months ago, and now the sales of the dark fizzy soda are to begin in earnest. 
Coca-Cola’s entry into a country bears a tremendous meaning, insists Tom Standage, author of “A History of the World in Six Glasses.” The moment Coca-Cola starts shipping is the moment you can see a real change, as Coca-Cola is a pure representation of capitalism, according to Standage.
Now, there are remains only two countries in the world where Coca-Cola is not sold -- at least, not officially. They are Cuba and North Korea. 
Long-term U.S. trade embargo has taken effect in Cuba since 1962 and it began taking into place in North Korea since 1950. In Cuba, after Fidel Castro’s government seized power in the country in the 1960s, the sales of Coca-cola were officially banned.
Yet there are news reports that showed Coca-Cola being sold in a restaurant in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. According to the drink maker, “if any drinks are being sold in these countries, they are being smuggled in on the black market, not via official channels.” 
Coca-cola was created in 1886 at a pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia. By 1930, Coca-Cola was bottled in 27 countries around the world and by 1959, it was operating in over 100 countries.
Recently, Coca-Cola’s rival PepsiCo also announced its plans to resume sales in Myanmar as the country adopts democratic reforms.
