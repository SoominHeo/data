Boys with weaker muscles have higher risk of early death
A Swedish study found that more muscular teenage boys tend to live longer, while those with weaker muscles are more likely to have health problems associated with early death, BBC News reported recently.
The long term study of over a million male adolescents (aged 16-19 years) found an association between boys with weaker muscles and increased risk of early death from any cause, including suicide and cardiovascular disease. 
The study was conducted by researchers from Sweden and Spain. It followed more than 1 million Swedish male adolescents who were eligible for military conscription over a period of 24 years. Although military service is not mandatory in Sweden, conscription examinations are required by law for all boys. 
The findings show that boys who scored highest on muscle strength had a 20-35 percent lower risk of early death from any cause. They were also 65 percent less likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis, such as schizophrenia or depression. On the other hand, adolescents who scored lowest on muscle strength had the highest risk of dying before reaching their mid-50s. 
A spokeswoman for the British Heart Foundation told BBC News that “The benefits of being physically active at any age are well established with studies showing it can prevent children from developing diseases later on in life, as well as improving their concentration at school, their overall mental health and well-being.”
Despite the findings of the study, however, experts emphasize that having bigger muscles does not necessarily equate to a longer life. In fact, because the study did not take into consideration the individual’s lifestyle factors, the association is seen as more of a correlation than causation. 
The study was published in the British Medical Journal.
