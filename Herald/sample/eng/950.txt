Local moviegoers mesmerized by ‘A Werewolf Boy’
Fantasy romance film “A Werewolf Boy” has drawn more than 3 million viewers in just 11 days since its release on Oct. 31. The film has outdone “Architecture 101,” a film about first love at college, which hit the 3 million mark in 27 days early this year.
It is a rare feat for a locally-made romance, especially considering November is a slow month for cinemas, according to the Korean Film Council.
It is the first commercial film by filmmaker Jo Sung-hee. The movie’s success is in large part owed to the irresistible charm of the film’s two main characters, Park Bo-young and Song Joong-ki. In the movie, the two showed the love that is so pure and powerful that you can even think of giving up your own life for it; this made “A Werewolf boy” so palatable to Korean audiences, as they too crave such romance in their lives. 
The film is about a love between a werewolf boy and a teenage girl, Suni. Suni is sent to a country house to help her recover from a lung disease, and there she met a werewolf boy. At first, she thinks of him as a nuisance but they soon become very close. 
She finds it entertaining to civilize him, and her mom later names him Chul-soo. Chul-soo eventually falls in love with Suni, the only person to open her heart and show him affection. 
In order to love her, he tries hard to loose his bestial instincts but his love is hindered by town villagers who were threatened by his existence. In order to save Chul-soo, who risked his life to be by her side, Suni leaves him in the mountains, promising that she will come back for him.
“A Werewolf Boy” was premiered in the “Contemporary World Cinema” section of the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and screened at the Busan International Film Festival before its theatrical release on Oct. 31. Actress Park sang a song, “My Prince,” from the film’s soundtrack.
