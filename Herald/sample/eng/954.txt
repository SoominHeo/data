An adventure in optical illusions: The TrickEye Museum
With winter break coming up, many people are looking for ways to have fun despite the colder temperatures. Since the lower temperatures make it difficult to spend long hours outside, this means having to turn to indoor activities for fun like museums. 
Unfortunately, getting excited about museums is hard for people who aren’t art-lovers. For most people, walking around from room to room looking at old pictures of random things can get boring after a few minutes. Fear not, however, as the TrickEye Museum found at the heart of Hongdae is different from your average museum. 
Rather than viewing paintings as in a typical art gallery, the TrickEye Museum features paintings created using a special technique called “trompe l’oeil,” which is “deceive the eye” in French. This means that rather than just looking at paintings, visitors can interact with and be part of the images themselves. There are not enough words to describe the amount of fun you can have while at the TrickEye Museum. 
The museum is divided into about 18 different sections, each section decorated with its own theme. Some sections feature hilarious parodies of classic paintings (i.e. a fat version of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa,” Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” with his pants pulled down, etc.) 
The museum isn’t just about taking pictures with interactive paintings. There are other ways to have fun, including the head-spinning maze of mirrors at the Magic Mirror Room, a make-your-own Trini Eyeni section, and a lucky darts game as well. 
There are plenty of ways to have fun at the TrickEye Museum, regardless of age, gender or nationality. Whether you go with friends or family, the environment at the TrickEye Museum is full of laughs.
