TV dramas are more interesting than light entertainment shows
PRO 
In TV dramas, actors play their parts with a screenplay, whereas a presenter and guests play together in light entertainment. I personally think dramas are more interesting for the following reasons.
To begin, watching TV dramas is like reading a book, but additionally actors come out to make story more lifelike. So, it is like seeing a movie, but more interesting because dramas are divided into many episodes. Dramas make people excited about the upcoming episodes.
Entertainment programs proceed with the presenters’ questions for the invited guests, so they are about real-life stories, which are usually rather dull. However, dramas are more like magic or fantasy, so they make people think in a more creative way.
In conclusion, I think TV dramas are more interesting than entertainment programs because they are more exciting and creative.
CON
There are many types of TV shows to choose from, but the main two are dramas and entertainment programs. If I had to pick between the two, I would go for entertainment shows.　
There are many choices as far as entertainment programs are concerned, such as talk shows, sports shows and fashion shows. People can pick any of them according to their individual taste.　
Second, dramas - especially historical ones - are imaginary and unrealistic. Meanwhile, entertainment programs look at real life and help people enhance their knowledge in different fields.
Third, entertainment programs, including those of more documentary-style, are much more fun and entertaining than most people think, thanks to constantly developing technology.
So, for the reasons I mentioned above, I think you should pick entertainment programs over TV dramas to watch during your free time.
