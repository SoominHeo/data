Export of traditional food gains momentum thanks to Hallyu
Exports of Korean traditional food such as kimchi and gochujang have soared in tandem with the increased popularity of Hallyu, the Korean Wave, a government-run customs service said on Nov. 28.
According to an analysis of 27 food companies by the Korea Customs Service, exports of kimchi recorded $88.8 million by October this year and is likely to exceed last year’s $104.5 million. 
Since 2009, kimchi exports have jumped 19.7 percent, the Korea Customs Service noted.
Growth in gochujang exports was even steeper. As of October this year, they recorded $19.1 million, a 57.6 percent increase from 2009.
Experts say the popularity of Korean culture, such as Korean dramas, movies and K-pop songs, has driven the increased demand of traditional Korean food in overseas market.
“Demand for Korean food has been formed among hallyu fans as they often see Korean food in Korean TV dramas,” said an official from the food industry. “The increasing number of tourists who visit the country is also helping sales.”
“Chongga Kimchi,” a local kimchi brand, has stolen the heart of Japanese customers with its kimchi menus. Starting this year, the company supplies its products to Canada’s largest supermarket, Safeway. It now sells kimchi over 200 stores across the world.
“Haechandle,” another local sauce brand, is famous among international consumers for its bean paste and red pepper paste products. Currently, the company sells a wide range of sauce to 110 stores in Japan.
Local food brands’ reach and K-food market’s expansion into the world food market is impressive and inspirational, stated Yonhap News.
