 ‘Snow White’ museum exhibit opens
 “Snow White,” an animated feature film beloved by kids and adults alike all over the globe, is celebrating its 75th anniversary with an exhibit at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco this year.
Called “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: The Creation of a Classic,” the exhibition celebrates Disney’s vision and the artistry of the film, “Snow White” which was the first, full-length animated feature film by Walt Disney Studios, according to BBC News. 
The museum presents the story and achievements of Walt Disney, using the latest technology, historic materials and artifacts.
Diane Disney Miller, Disney’s daughter and the founder of the museum, says that her father was “completely and intimately engaged in the film from start to finish,” which took almost four years to complete.
Snow White was “the first of its kind to have the depth of character, careful attention to story, original music that helped tell that story and superb artistry,” Miller noted.
Snow White premiered at Hollywood’s Carthay Circle Theater on Dec. 21, 1937 and it was named the greatest animated film of all time by the American Film Institute in 2008.
The exhibit features more than 200 works of art from the film, including conceptual drawings and scenes that had been deleted from the film.
Lella Smith, the exhibit’s guest curator said the majority of works featured in the exhibit have never been published or exhibited before. “It’s a chance for people to see some amazing artwork,” she said.
