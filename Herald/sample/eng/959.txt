Cost of Gimjang, barometer of inflation
It is that time of year; the season of gimjang has arrived. 
Kimchi serves as the most important side dish for Korean households throughout the year; this makes gimjang a big national event. 
Gimjang usually takes place in late fall, when main ingredients of gimjang, radishes and cabbages are harvested. Various seasonings like salt, chili pepper powder, and fermented fish sauces are added to make kimchi.
This year, a family of four has to pay an average of 229,750 won ($211.5), up from last year’s 187,930 won to prepare for the mass kimchi-making. 
The retail industry says households will have to pay about 22.3 percent more an average (about 50,000 won) to make the nation’s favorite side dish from last year due to the rising costs of fresh produce. This means this year, the extra cost to Koreans is the equivalent of 10 meals at McDonald’s, 25 Hershey’s chocolate bars, or 20 Baskin Robbins ice-cream cones.
The figure took into account the prices of 13 essential ingredients at nation’s major discount stores, including Napa cabbage, radish, water celery, chili powder and salted fermented shrimp. 
The average price of vegetables is up 19 percent due to heavy rains and typhoons this summer.
The price of 20 heads of cabbage rose 94.7 percent to 37,000 won this year while 10 radishes were priced at 21,800 won, up 74.4 percent from last year. 
Other essential ingredients used for seasoning, like garlic, ginger and mustard greens were also selling at inflated prices. Only shrimp, chili powder and coarse salt have not soared in price over the last 12 months.
The cost of gimjang makes up a critical part of the nations’ household budget.
The higher price of gimjang means higher overall consumer costs in the national economy. 
Therefore, Gimjang is a true barometer and leading indicator of the country’s inflation level.
