Happier children may earn more money
Though money may not necessarily bring you happiness, a recent study found that happiness could bring you more money. 　
Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study found that people who were happier in their youth tended to be more prosperous by age 30. 
Dr. Andrew Oswald, co-author of the study, told HealthDay News that the purpose of the study was to “figure out what happiness actually does.”
“We might think that human happiness is important in itself as a goal, but does it cause other things, perhaps other good things?” he added. 
Using data from the federally funded Add Health survey, the researchers tracked the profiles of over 10,000 American teenagers at ages 16, 18 and 22, before checking in on their annual incomes at age 29. 
The results showed a significant relationship between the individuals’ reported incomes at age 29 and their level of happiness during their teenage years. 
In fact, the study found that the relationship was particularly pronounced for those who reported lower levels of happiness. Individuals that reported a “profoundly unhappy” adolescence were found to have an income at age 29 that is about 30 percent less than the average. On the other hand, individuals that reported a very happy adolescence were associated with a later income that is about 10 percent higher than the average. 
Even when comparing roughly 3,000 siblings, the study found that the happier sibling tended to have higher earnings compared to unhappier one, despite theoretically growing up in the same household. 
Oswald suggests that their findings point to the value of creating happy environments for children.
“If you take our work at face value, it suggests that if you could make young Americans happier, then they would later become richer,” he said. “It is possible that could work for a whole economy. A happier U.S. would translate, eventually, into a richer one.”
