JYJ and TVXQ: Peace at last
This is it; the end of an era. JYJ and S.M. Entertainment have finally put an end to their seemingly never-ending legal dispute over the management contract the trio signed when they debuted in 2003 as the five-member boy band, TVXQ. 
Members of JYJ –- Kim Jae-joong, Park Yu-chun and Kim Jun-su -– spent more than three years locked in a legal battle with one of Korea’s top entertainment agencies, S.M. Entertainment. The three ex-TVXQ members had filed an injunction in 2009 against S.M. over what they considered to be unfair conditions of their 13-year management contract as members of TVXQ. 
In response, S.M. accused the three members of being greedy. Since then, despite having been granted a temporary injunction by the Seoul Central District Court, the two sides have been locked in legal battle as JYJ fought to have its contract with S.M. negated.
The battle finally came to an end on Nov. 28, when both sides agreed to finally put an end to their legal disputes.
