JYJ vs. S.M. Entertainment
July 2009Three members of TVXQ - Kim Jae-joong, Park Yu-chun and Kim Jun-su - file an injunction against S.M. Entertainment, but continue to be part of TVXQ’s activities in Japan under the Japanese management company, Avex. Through their lawyers, the three members stated that the 13-year contract was excessively long and that the group’s earnings were not being distributed fairly to the five members. 　
Aug. 2009 TVXQ vs. S.M. Entertainment trial begins. Meanwhile, 120,000 members of TVXQ’s official fanclub, Cassiopeia, filed a petition against S.M. Entertainment’s unfair long-term contract with the Seoul District Court. 　
Oct. 2009 The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of Kim Jae-joong, Park Yu-chun and Kim Jun-su, affirming their right to independently engage in entertainment activities. A temporary injunction was granted. 　
Nov. 2009 S.M. Entertainment calls a press conference denouncing the lawsuit filed by the three ex-TVXQ members as fraud. The company stated that the three members were acting out because of greed. 　
Dec. 2009 A mere five months after three TVXQ members filed for an injunction, Han Geng of SuperJunior followed suit, citing discrimination on top of unfair contractual obligations.　
April 2010 Avex announced the hiatus of TVXQ’s activities in Japan, bringing an end of TVXQ as a five-member group. In the same month and under the same Japanese management, Kim Jae-joong, Park Yu-chun and Kim Jun-su debuted as JYJ in Japan. In Korea, they signed under C-JeS Entertainment, a minor company. 　
November 2012 After being postponed countless times over a span of 3 years, the two sides were finally able to mediate successfully. On Nov. 28, 2012 S.M. Entertainment and JYJ members officially agreed to end their legal dispute.
