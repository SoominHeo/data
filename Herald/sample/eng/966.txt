The Funny Bicycling Center
It is time to throw away any preconceptions you may have about bicycles. They are no longer mere instruments for exercise, but a source for cultivating creativity, learning and most importantly, fun. 
That, anyway, is the premise of the Funny Bicycling Center, located at the Gwacheon National Science Museum. 
The Funny Bicycling Center began operating earlier this year in March. Together with either family or friends, visitors can check out the more than 40 different types of bicycles. 
“I wish people would think a little before just riding the bikes,” joked Choi Won-il, the Deputy Director of the Science Culture Promotion Division at the Gwacheon National Science Museum. 
“They aren’t just bikes,” he added. “Each one requires hours of testing and research” before they were approved to be part of the center.
Each bike is uniquely designed to create a fun way to develop one’s scientific curiosity and imagination. The crabwalk bicycle, for example, goes sideways when you step on the pedals, whereas the frog bicycle doesn’t even have any pedals, requiring you to jump up and down to make it go forward. 
Set up specifically to encourage children to explore their creativity, the Funny Bicycling Center also provides an opportunity to gain practical knowledge about science by going for a ride on the different types of bicycles.
