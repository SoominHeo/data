 Figure skater Yu-na wins NRW Trophy title
Despite a year-and-a-half hiatus from major competitions, the Figure skater Kim Yu-na still had her magic. 
The reigning Olympic champion made a long-awaited and utterly impressive comeback at the NRW Trophy in Dortmund, Germany, on Dec. 9-10.
She grabbed both the title and high enough scores to qualify for next year’s world championships.
Under International Skating Union rules, Kim needed to earn at least 28 points in her technical element score in the short program and 48 points in the free skating to participate in the 2013 World Figure Skating Championships in Ontario, Canada, which opens on March 10-17. 　
Though the NRW Trophy is a minor competition, it is often used by skaters who need extra points to make the world championships.
It was Kim’s first competition since the World Championships in April 2011. She has trained for just five months since making the announcement in July this year that she would return to competitive skating. 
Kim skated her short program to “The Kiss of the Vampire” and earned 72.27 points. She performed the free skating program to a compilation of songs from the popular musical “Les Miserables,” a musical based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo and scored 129.34 points. In total, Kim Yu-na scored 201.61 points, the highest score made by a female figure skater this season. 
Ksenia Makarova of Russia, came second at the competition with a total of 159.01 points. 
With this, the 22-year-old is now one step closer to a chance to win another gold medal in the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
