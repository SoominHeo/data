Kate Middleton announces her pregnancy
Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, is pregnant with a child, St James’s Palace announced on Dec 3.
In a statement, St James’s Palace said: “Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby. 
Kate has been admitted to the King Edward VII hospital with acute morning sickness.
Doctors say her condition is relatively common among early stage of pregnancy and requires supplementary hydration and nutrients. 
Kate Middleton, 30, married to Price William at Westminster Abbey in April 29 last year.
The couple’s baby, whether it would be a girl or boy, will be third in line to the throne, after Prince Charles and Prince William. In October, 2011, Commonwealth leaders agreed to change succession laws so that the daughter of any future U.K. monarch will have equal right to the throne as a son. 
Although the law has not yet been revised, Kate and William’s first child, if she is a girl, would not be overtaken by any younger brother. Prince Harry will lose his third-in-line to the throne position to the new baby. 
Historians say it is a duchess’ first “duty and ambition” to produce an heir for “the survival of the ancient institution.” 
A day after Kate was being admitted to the hospital, two Australian radio hosts made a prank call, asking for the Duchess of Cambridge’s condition. 
Mel Greig and Michael Christian, the hosts of the 2Day FM show, pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles. A nurse, hoaxed by the hosts, revealed the Duchess’ private information. The recording went viral and on Dec. 10, the nurse who answered the call, Jacintha Saldanha, 46, the mother of two, was found dead in a suspected suicide. The two hosts were reported to be “shattered” by the news of the nurse’s death.
