Korea’s trade volume marks world’s 8th highest
The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said on Dec. 10 that Korea’s annual trade volume topped $1 trillion for the second consecutive year, making the country the 8th largest trade powerhouse.
According to the ministry, Korea’s exports for 2012 stood at $513 billion while its imports marked $487 billion.
The record comes despite a global economic slowdown that is being extended by a financial crisis in Europe.
The seven countries which were ranked above Korea in trade are the United States, China, Germany, Japan, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Korea’s trade volume has steadily increased from 2000, when the country was the world’s 13th biggest trader. The country’s ranking went up to 12th in 2003, 11th in 2007, 10th in 2009 and then 9th in 2010.
The world’s trade leaders, including the United States and China, showed poor performance starting from the 2nd quarter this year. Statistics also showed thatmajor economies’ trade fell by 1.2 percent in April, 3.6 percent in June, 5.8 percent in August and 3.7 percent in September.
During the January-September period, Korea’s cumulative exports declined 1.6 percent from the same period a year before, but they had showed signs of rebounding since late October, according to the Ministry of Knowledge Economy.
Meanwhile, experts advise that Korea should further enhance its economic productivity and independence, deviating from the country’s dependence on China for exports and on Japan for imports of core materials.
