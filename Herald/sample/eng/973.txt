Fathers of an only daughter most gender-equal
Fathers of an only daughter are most gender equal-minded, a survey by a local research institute showed.
In a survey of 1,800 parents of elementary, middle and high school students carried out last July, fathers of an only daughter were revealed to believe most strongly that men and women are equal. 
Fathers of an only daughter scored the highest with 76.76 points on average on gender equality consciousness, the state-run Korea Women’s Development Institute reported. 
The result was higher than the 74.92 points earned by mothers of two daughters and the 73.72 points the mothers of only daughters garnered in the poll.
Parents with the lowest scorers were fathers of an only son. They scored only 60.68 points, 16 points less than fathers of an only daughter. Fathers with one son and one daughter also scored disappointing 63.32 points.
Between fathers and mothers, mothers were found to be more understanding and open about the topic of gender equality than fathers. 
Mothers in general scored an average of 71.5 points on the consciousness of gender equality compared to fathers with 64.81 points. 
“Even fathers with regular outlooks experience gender inequality in an indirect manner, while rearing their daughters,” said Ahn Sang-soo, senior researcher at the institute. “Daughter’s lives affected fathers’ mindset about women positively, as they always worry about or expect much from their daughters.” This might have created the idiom “Ddal-Babo,” meaning fathers who are fools to daughters as they blindly love them.
