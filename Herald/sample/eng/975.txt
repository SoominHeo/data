Real Experience Project: The Human Condition
When was the last time you just stopped and watched people as they interacted with the world around them? Prior to the era of smartphones, people would be looking up, enjoying the view as they went about their days. In today’s society of multitasking, however, you would notice that most people are busy fiddling with their respective smartphones or tablets.　
In the hopes of bringing to light this shift in society, Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) began a pilot program called “Real Experience Project: The Human Condition” starring six comedians from the much-loved, critically acclaimed comedy show, “Gag Concert.”
The show follows the lives of the six comedians -- Kim Joon-hyun, Kim Joon-ho, Heo Kyung-hwan, Yang Sang-gook, Jung Tae-ho and Park Sung-ho -- as they attempt to go seven days without access to what is now considered a necessity in society. Each member must live in a dorm during the week as they adjust to life without access to the Internet, their smartphones or the T.V. 
In the beginning, each member found it difficult to adjust, though as time passed, each began dealing with the inconvenience in different ways. 
“The Human Condition” may only be four episodes long, but in the show is a valuable lesson to be learned by all. As technology has made things easier and more convenient in some ways, it has also taken away an important aspect of our humanity. Each member was only able to fully appreciate the value of the personal touch, significance of face-to-face conversations, and the true meaning of friendship once they were rid of the distractions caused by the “convenience” of technology. 
Interestingly, each member was also surprised to find that without the availability of T.V., the Internet or their cell phones, they had a surprising amount of free time on their hands.
