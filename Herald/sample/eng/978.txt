Should music lyrics be censored?
Pro - Music is mainly used to give happiness or hope to people. However, this happiness and hope is being blocked by the words that are not supposed to be used in lyrics. I think the music lyrics should be censored for the following reasons.
Most people, from babies to elders, listen to music, but bad words in the lyrics disturb them sometimes, worrying the parents of children. This is a serious problem because the kids may copy and repeat the bad words.
In addition, even if the lyrics are meant to represent certain artists’ musical style, the artists should think seriously about the people who are listening to their music. The main purpose of making music is to make people who listen to their music feel happy. To that end, artists should consider who the listeners are beforehand.
In conclusion, I think music lyrics should be censored because we should consider who the main targets of the music are.
Con - Music is one of the ways people can relieve their stress from and get across the messages they want to share. But if some authorities censor music lyrics, it is the same as taking away freedom of expression. I have two major reasons why I am against censorship.
First, as I said, censoring music is a way of making unnecessary rules. When the original messages from musicians or authors are distorted before being given out, the audience will not be able to understand the writer’s intent.
Second, if some lyrics cannot reach teenagers, for example, just because they are considered harmful, the kids may not even have the chance to listen to music. I think children should be also given opportunities to judge what is good and bad - including ideas about drinking or smoking.
So, I believe that censorship of music lyrics is not desirable because it can distort what artists are trying to say and stop people from listening to the author’s message.
