Pepsi strikes multi-million dollar deal with Beyonce
Pepsi decided to sign a $50 million contract with Beyoncé next year, but the company says it is not just about using her on its advertisements. 
Pepsi does not just want the pop diva for its TV commercials, but by utilizing her creative whims, it wants to get involved in the Beyoncé business, The New York Times reported.
At the heart of this unconventional deal is Pepsi’s new creative content development fund.
This multimillion-dollar fund not only includes the standard advertising like commercials but collaborative projects to support the singer’s creative projects. It will sponsor Beyoncé’s world tour next year, her performance at the Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 3 and promote her next album scheduled for release in 2013.
The shift from a transactional deal to a mutually beneficial collaboration has brought Pepsi closer to the music industry, says Brad Jakeman, president of PepsiCo’s global beverage group. According to Pepsi, its goal is to enhance its reputation with consumers by acting as something of an artistic patron instead of simply paying for celebrity endorsements. 
“Pepsi embraces creativity and understands that artists evolve,” Beyoncé said in a statement. “As a businesswoman, this allows me to work with a lifestyle brand with no compromise and without sacrificing my creativity,” said Lee Anne Callahan-Longo, the general manager of Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé’s company.
Beyoncé will appear in a new Pepsi TV ad - her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 and her face will be on limited-edition Pepsi cans. 
PepsiCo reportedly spent about $148 million just in the United States to advertise its brand in the first six months of this year.
