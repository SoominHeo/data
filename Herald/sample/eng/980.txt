Ryu Hyun-jin signs deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers
Korea’s left-handed pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin, 25, signed a six-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Dec. 10, becoming the 13th Korean to play in Major League Baseball.　
The deal was made in the nick of time, signed only 30 seconds before the deadline. 
Scott Boras, the agent of Matsuzaka, represented Ryu and pulled off a satisfying deal for him.
The deal is reportedly worth $36 million, with a yearly bonus of $1 million based on innings pitched. This makes the maximum amount Ryu can earn over the six years, $42 million, says Yonhap News Agency.
With the opt-out clause, Ryu, can also become a free agent after five seasons in 2014 as long as he pitches a minimum of 150 innings per year. 
Early on, the Dodgers showed strong interest in Ryu, posting $25.7 million to negotiate with Hanhwa, but talks broke down due to irreconcilable differences between the two teams. 
“We are excited to welcome [Ryu] to Los Angeles and the United States, continuing the tradition of Korean pitchers with the Dodger organization,” said Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti on the team’s website. 
“The Dodgers continue to show the commitment to signing players from Asia and other international areas where baseball is played at the highest levels. 
“We are looking forward to watching Ryu pitch for the franchise.”
With the astronomical deal, he is leaving the Korean league with 98 wins and 52 losses. While playing for seven years in Hanhwa Eagles, Ryu received the Golden Glove twice, in 2006 and 2010. He is one of the few left-handers in Korea who can throw nearly 150 kilometers per hour and a variety of breaking balls, such as a curveball. 
Previously, three Korean baseball players had played for the Dodgers. Pitchers Park Chan-ho played from 1994-2001, Seo Jae-weong in 2006 and Choi Hee-seop from 2004-2005.
