‘Brownie’ leads character industry development
Things are looking up for the character business in the country, following the advent of Brownie the dog, according to the retail industry.
It was in July when the Siberian husky dog Brownie first met the nationwide audience through a sketch at the KBS comedy program Gag Concert, where the dog on a leash follows the discontented customer Ms. Jung (Played by Jung Tae-ho) and stands by the owner throughout the scketch.
Though the dog never speaks a word, it plays a central role in the program and plays now an even more important role in the character business in Korea.
Retail industry officials said that sales of puppy dolls had soared since Brownie first appeared on TV. With ear-end holidays and New Year’s celebrations ahead the sales of the dolls would become even larger, they explain.
The boom in character business is not without precedent. Pororo, the popular Korean animated cartoon character of a penguin, is making a whopping 390 million won a year.
According to statistics, Korea’s character business has grown in size to reach the annual sales of 7.2 trillion won, over 22 percent gain from year 2011.
Experts explain that the Siberian husky dog is pumping up the slow domestic market, which has been battered by the global financial crisis.
Meanwhile, there is the great news that Brownie has donated a large amount of money to poor people through a charity organization.
Tajo, the company with the commercial rights to Brownie, said in mid-December that it had delivered part of its yearly profits - 10 million won - to the “Community Chest of Korea,” a charity organization based in Jung-gu, Seoul. Brownie was named the promotional ambassador of the organization with the donation.
