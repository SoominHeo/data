Shinhan Group hosts love-sharing festival
A charity festival hosted by Shinhan Financial Group took place at Cheonggye Plaza, central Seoul, on Dec. 6 to 7.
The festival was the company’s second following that of last year, and this time it was co-organized by such welfare organizations as the Seoul Council on Social Welfare and Community Chest of Korea.
The event this year was prepared for citizens to take part in helping the poor and heightening the year-end festivity at the same time. The participants were also given a chance to decorate the Christmas tree placed at Cheonggye Plaza.
On Dec. 6, the first day of the event, a mass kimchi-making event took place at major cities of Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Gwangju and Jeju. A total of 7,000 heads of cabbage were used for the nationwide gimjang event. Several TV figures including actress Kim Jung-nan were also present at the event.
The Christmas tree-lighting ceremony held on the evening of Dec. 6 was attended by heads of Seoul Council on Social Welfare and Community Chest of Korea. Also, London Olympic gold medalist Yang Hak-sun whom Shinhan Financial Group is sponsoring, was there.
On the evening of Dec. 7, a special “love-sharing music concert” was held. Underprivileged children showed off their talents by taking part in a B-boy dance show and an orchestra performance.
“This charity event is especially meaningful because citizens can also become part of it,” said an official from Shinhan Financial Group. “Shinhan Group will continue to offer social community service and try to do what it can to help the people in need.”
