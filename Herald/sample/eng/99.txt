S. Korea to hold joint orchestra performance with the North
Yonhap News reported on Sept. 16 that a prominent South Korean conductor Chung Myung-whun had agreed with Pyongyang officials to hold joint North-South symphony orchestra performances on a regular basis. 
Chung Myung-whun is the head of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra and also serves as a UNICEF “goodwill ambassador.” He returned home on Sept. 15 after a four-day trip to the North in an effort to promote cultural exchanges.
 According to Chung, performances will be held both in Seoul and Pyongyang in rotation.
