Who are happiest people on Earth?
Who do you think are the world's happiest people? 
A Gallup poll released on Dec. 19 shows that the world’s happiest people are Latin Americans. In the survey of nearly 150,000 people around the world, seven of the world’s 10 happiest countries were located in Latin America.
Last year, Gallup Inc. asked about 1,000 people from 148 countries if they smiled or laughed a lot, did something interesting or felt feelings of joy.
About 85 percent of people in Panama and Paraguay said yes, putting them at the top of the happiest people’s list. They were followed by El Salvador, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Guatemala, the Philippines, Ecuador and Costa Rica. 
People who showed the least amount of positive emotions were from Singapore, one of world’s most wealthy, peaceful and orderly nations. “We work like dogs and get paid peanuts. “There's hardly any time for holidays or just to relax in general because you’re always thinking ahead: when the next deadline or meeting is. There is hardly a fair sense of work-life balance here,” a 33-year-old Singaporean businessman said. 
Other wealthy countries like Germany, France and the United States also turned out to be quite unhappy. 
On the other hand, Guatemala, a country devastated by civil war, made one of the happiest nations’ lists. 
"In Guatemala, it’s a culture of friendly people who are always smiling," says a 30-year-old surfing instructor. "Despite all the problems that we’re facing, we're surrounded by natural beauty that lets us get away from it all."
"Life is short and there are no reasons to be sad because even if we were rich, there would still be problems.”
“Something fundamental about these Latin Americans are that they have a habit of focusing on positives such as friends, family and religion despite daily lives that can be grindingly difficult,” Jon Clifton, a partner at Gallup said. “I think there is higher positive emotionality in these countries.”
