Fellow stars have voted and decided that 2012 was Suzy’s year 
On TV show “Weekly Idol,” a large group of K-pop stars took part in the selection of the nation’s top seven entertainers of 2012.
Suzy of Miss A topped the coveted list. Others to make the list were Kwanghee of ZE:A, who appeared in lots of variety shows thanks to his outstanding sense of humor and A-Pink’s Eunji, who starred in “Respond 1997,” one of the year’s most successful dramas. The stars on the list have all made a successful transition from singing to all-around entertainment. 
Aside from being a valuable member of Miss A, Suzy has delved into a wide variety of solo activities. Suzy hosted several music ceremonies, including the 21st Seoul Music Awards, the 26th Golden Disk Awards, and Mnet 20’s Choice Awards. 
Following her acting debut in “Dream High” in 2011, Suzy starred as a main character in romance “Architecture 101” this year. The film, which was released on March, was a box office hit. With the film, she won the Best New Actress Award at the 48th Paeksang Arts Awards.
