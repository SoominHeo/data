Era of digital broadcasting opens
Now in Korea the age of analogue broadcasting is gone, replaced by the era of digital broadcasting.
The introduction of digital broadcasting has long been planned, as it can provide clearer images and sounds for viewers.
Provinces including Gangwon, Chungcheong, Gyeongsang and Jeolla finished their analogue broadcasting in Novemer 2012 to adopt the newer broadcasting. Seoul launched the digital broadcasting last, in January 2013.
Through digital broadcasting, viewers can not only interact with TV but also enjoy images and sounds six times clearer than through analogue broadcasting.
Also, viewers can search their favorite TV programs or find TV celebrities’ profiles using only the remote control. 
The viewers are also allowed to have unprecedented access to the products shown in TV programs. For example, they can locate clothes, bags or accessories in TV dramas or commercials, and then order those products through TV; this is different from traditional purchases from online stores.
More than anything else, the new method of broadcasting is highly likely to bring profits to the national economy, according to economic experts.
For one, different markets for newer broadcasting devices and TV sets will be in place. Markets for multimedia content will also be created with wider broadcasting channels being in place.
These newer markets will need much more workers than before, so leading creation of new jobs and decrease in unemployment.
Experts say that digital broadcasting has already created production inducement of 39 trillion won, value added inducement of 14 trillion won and employment for 230,000 people by the end of 2012.
