Study suggests women are better at judging faithfulness than men
Parents have always taught their children to avoid judging a person based purely on their looks. It turns out, however, that for women, judging a man’s first impression could prove beneficial in some important ways.
A new study found that women are relatively accurate when judging whether or not a man is likely to be unfaithful in a relationship by just looking at his face.
Sixty-four university students (half men, half women) were shown colored pictures of 189 Caucasian adult faces. The men and women in the photos were asked to disclose whether or not they had been unfaithful to their partners in the past.
The researchers asked the participants to rate each photo for faithfulness and level of masculinity or femininity. 
The study found that compared to men, women were more accurate at guessing whether a man was more likely to be unfaithful in a relationship than vice versa. In fact, women were only wrong 38 percent of the time, whereas men guessed wrong 77 percent of the time.
“Women’s ratings of unfaithfulness showed small-moderate, significant correlations with measures of actual infidelity,” wrote the team of researchers in the study, published in the Dec. 4 issue of the journal Biology Letters.
“More masculine-looking men [were] rated as more probable to be unfaithful and having a ... history of being more unfaithful.”
According to the researchers, this provides “the first evidence that faithfulness judgments, based solely on facial appearance, have a kernel of truth.”
“It seems remarkable that such impressions have any accuracy at all, given how poor accuracy is even with extensive behavioral information,” the study continues.
Surprisingly, the study also found that men tended to perceive attractive, feminine women as more likely to be unfaithful despite there being no evidence of such a correlation.
