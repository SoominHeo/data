'Life of Pi'- manual to coexist with wild tiger
“Life of Pi” is a 2012 American adventure fantasy drama film. The movie is based on Canadian author Yann Martel‘s 2001 novel “Life of Pi.” 
Directed by Ang Lee, the film was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, including Best Picture, Drama and Best Director. 
The film begins as Pi Patel, an immigrant from India who lives in Canada, is approached by a novelist who is eager to hear about his mind-blowing story.
The story is about a 16-year old boy named Piscine Patel, or “Pi” (the mathematical symbol, π). Pi’s family owned a local zoo in India. An interesting thing about Pi was that he believed in three different religions, Hindu, Christianity and Islam, by his own will.
When Pi was 16, his family decided to move to Canada. But the boat sank on the Pacific Ocean and he and four other animals - a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker - survived on a lifeboat.
Yet as the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan and then the tiger killed the hyena, only Pi and tiger are left behind. 
While floating the vast, limitless ocean for 227 days with Richard Parker, Pi encounters nature’s wonders such as a magnificent school of dolphins at night. The lifeboat eventually reaches the coast of Mexico but the adventure doesn’t stop there.
