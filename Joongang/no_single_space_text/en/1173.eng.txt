The police deployed a total of 1.45 million personnel at various times to hunt down Yoo Byung-eun, the de facto owner of Chonghaejin Marine Company, the operator of the sunken ferry Sewol, a tragedy that cost the nation the lives of over 300 passengers.
They utterly failed to find Yoo while he was alive.
His body was ultimately found by a local farmer in a plum orchard 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) away from a villa in which Yoo had been hiding.
Local police got the corpse but didn’t report it to their superiors despite plentiful clues suggesting the identity of the dead, elderly and well-dressed man.
The police’s botching of the manhunt for Yoo is even more deplorable than the inept response of the coast guard to the fatal sinking of the Sewol on April 16.
When Yoo’s eldest son Dae-gyun attempted to depart for Paris at Incheon Airport on April 19, the police didn’t attempt to detect his whereabouts.
Even though the Ansan Police Station acquired an arrest warrant for Dae-gyun on May 12, it didn’t control the entry of people into Geumsuwon, the retreat of the Salvation Sect, which was led by Yoo.
If the police had raided the facility or kept a close watch after surrounding it at the time, they could have arrested Yoo.
But police officers sat on their hands because “the case was handled by the prosecution.”
 The prosecution belatedly raided Yoo’s villa on May 24, but failed to catch him.
If they had directed the police to control the area around the villa, it could have led to different results.
The way the police reacted to Yoo’s body when they had it in their possession is more dumbfounding.
His personal effects provided good clues to his identity.
The windbreaker he wore, for example, was a very expensive Italian brand.
Various conspiracy theories are spreading due to people’s distrust of the government since the Sewol disaster.
The authorities must figure out the cause of Yoo’s death and arrest his two sons.
