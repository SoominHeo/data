The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea is being swept up in a debate over its identity and contentious manifesto ahead of the national convention to select the new leadership on Aug. 27.
An overheated debate on these issues could overwhelm the convention with ideological wrangling, taking away from discussions of policies for the people and economy.
The Minjoo Party rejected the idea of rewriting its manifesto to be more in tune with the broad concept of “citizens” proposed

The opposition regained its strong footing in the legislature after the former dissident faction led 
Watching the fiasco over the phrase “workers,” Kim lamented that all the endeavors to change the image of the party were going down the drain.
The Minjoo Party is once again dominated 
But the party has no future if it clings to the past and declares itself a party for workers.
