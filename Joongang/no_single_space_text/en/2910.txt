Sex crimes committed by senior citizens against the weak cannot be ignored anymore.
In a small village in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang, a woman with a mental disability has for many years been prey to sexual assaults by a group of residents in their 60s and 70s.
In a small town in South Jeolla, as many as 10 men in the same age range were indicted for their persistent sexual violence against another mentally handicapped woman.
Sex crimes by senior citizens ring sharp alarm bells.
According to police statistics, the number of sexual predators in their 60s soared to 809 last year from 481 in 2007, while the statistic for people in their 70s rose to 268 last year from 193 four years earlier.
