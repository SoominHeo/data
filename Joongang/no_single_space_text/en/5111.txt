Many radishes were found abandoned yesterday on a field in Haenam, South Jeolla.
As farmers cannot make a profit from radish sales due to plunging market prices, they said they have given up harvesting crops which they have cultivated since last fall.
Instead, farmers took radish leaves that they can sell as vegetables on the market for better prices.
