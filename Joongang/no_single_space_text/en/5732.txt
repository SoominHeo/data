The replacement of Park Young-joon, a presidential secretary for planning and coordination, was inevitable as a preliminary measure for reshuffling.
It is the right move to ask him to take responsibility because he caused problems by interfering with personnel affairs that were beyond his duties.
The replacement was necessary to clear suspicion about the possibility that the very people who caused problems in personnel affairs would be involved in the reform of personnel affairs again.
But there are other concerns.
Legislator Chung Doo-un pointed out that there are four people who were busier gathering personal loot than working on state affairs.
They include the chief of staff at the Blue House, two presidential secretaries and legislator Lee Sang-deuk, the president’s older brother who used to be a deputy speaker at the National Assembly.
As Chung’s remark can be part of a power struggle, one probably shouldn’t trust everything he says.
However, it is well-known that the four have been in the president’s inner circle who led personnel affairs.
Legislator Lee has denied the accusation but suspicions remain.
On the morning that Presidential Secretary Park was fired, it is known that the president had breakfast with his older brother and made the decision.
It is also said that the older Lee sent someone to Park Geun-hye to see if she would consider becoming the prime minister.
This is definitely an act of interference in personnel affairs.
There is nothing wrong with the older brother, as a veteran politician, giving political advice to the younger brother.
But the problem is the advice is aimed at employing those he favors.
With even the ruling Grand National Party making complaints about some members taking personal loot, the situation can’t be ignored.
Problems in personnel affairs have led to today’s chaos that is to be solved through reshuffling.
Reshuffling should be left to new people.
