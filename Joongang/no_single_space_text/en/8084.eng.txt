The monopoly of the tobacco industry will be lifted early next year.
 The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced September 8 that it will introduce a bill in the fall regular session of the National Assembly to amend the law regulating the tobacco industry.
 When it becomes law, the tobacco manufacturing monopoly will be broken down.
Entry into the industry by private entities will be possible upon meeting reporting requirements.
 Government control of cigarette prices will also be revoked.
A finance ministry source said that the change will engender equity between domestic and imported cigarettes.
Prices of imported cigarettes are not controlled by the government.
＂The new law is also intended to stimulate the price of Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Co. shares and prepare the enterprise for privatization,＂ said the source.
 ＂The Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Co. has been losing 13 won for each pack of 'This' cigarettes it sells," he added.
"We expect a 133 won increase in the price when cigarette taxes are fully included.＂
