President Kim Dae-jung said on September 3 that he will strive to bring back South Korean POWs and abductees from North Korea and that more behind-the-scenes contacts are needed to realize their repatriation.
 Speaking to representatives of three major television networks during a special broadcast, President Kim said there were about 300 to 400 POWs and another 300 to 400 abductees in North Korea.
He added that most of them have remarried and now live with their families in North Korea.
He is determined to effect their return, however.
"I will arrange letter exchanges, meetings, and possibly permanent reunions between them and their relatives in South Korea," asserted President Kim.
 As for North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's plans to visit Seoul, President Kim said: "There is no doubt that he will visit Seoul soon, but it hasn't been decided whether he will visit before the end of the year or next spring.
We need to continue talks to determine the opportune time."
On medical reform, President Kim said he would 'turn the crisis into an opportunity' and overhaul the Korean health care system.
He will also form a special presidential committee on health care reform to advance Korea's health care standards to a level on par with the advanced countries.
 President Kim also vowed to reintroduce the capital gains tax, which has been on hold since the Asian financial crisis, as soon as next year.
