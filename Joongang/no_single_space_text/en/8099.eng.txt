＂At the next minister-level talks of North and South Korea in Pyongyang on August 29, South Korea will open discussion on the POW situation,＂ said Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu on August 21.
Unification Minister Park attended an interview with military representatives of the reserve, including Korean Veterans Association Chairman Lee Sang-hoon, Korean Retired Generals and Admirals Association Chairman Chung Sung-hwa, and the Association of War Veterans Organizations Chairman Yu Jae-heung.
Minister Park said, ＂the government has been requesting North Korea to send POWs to South Korea in return for unswerving communist prisoners to North Korea.
It is my belief  that North Korea understands our position on this.＂ Before this interview, 100 members representing soldiers who had fought in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, held a demonstration in front of the government complex in Sejong-ro on August 21.
After the demonstration, 18 representatives of various veteran organizations visited Unification Minister Park and National Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae to complain about the lack of effort on the behalf of the South Korean government.
Chairman Yu and other representatives strongly argued to the ministers that, ＂the unswerving communist prisoners, who complete their sentences in South Korea, are sent to North Korea.
Yet, South Korea failed to resolve this issue of having POWs sent to the South.
It is certainly an imbalanced government policy.＂ In order to stiffen the morale of the 700,000 soldiers defending the truce line, the government should put forth its best efforts to repatriate the 343 POWs from North Korea,＂ the representatives urged.
Cho Chang-ho, who was captured during the Korean War and made his dramatic escape in 1994, said, ＂after I returned to South Korea in 1994, 11 more war prisoners managed to get home.＂ Cho emphasized that, ＂the war prisoners currently in North Korea still believe and hope that the Republic of Korea will rescue them.
