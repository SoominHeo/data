The National Tax Administration (NTA) is reportedly examining the financial accounts of the family owners of conglomerates or ＇chaebol＇, such as Hyundai and Samsung.
This comes on top of its current investigation into the movement of stocks within the conglomerates.
 The NTA announced on August 13 that its efforts to trace the movement of stocks within the families - overlooked for five years - have been prolonged by the additional investigation into financial accounts.
 Meanwhile, in a separate probe, the government body is examining major chaebol companies＇ corporate tax records.
The NTA is focusing its investigation on the top three chaebol and their use of new financial products such as convertible bonds and bonds with subscription warrants to evade taxation.
As for the non-listed shares, NTA is examining whether the chaebols had their transactions properly evaluated in accordance with tax regulations.
 The NTA is also seeking to discover the sources of funds used to buy shares and whether company funds were used to transfer shares to close family members.
 An NTA official said the investigation into the financial accounts of the chaebol was inevitable, and that he was unable to comment on whether there is evidence of illegal transfers of funds within the chaebol families at this point.
