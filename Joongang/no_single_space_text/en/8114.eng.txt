The Korean government announced on August 2 that Seoul and Beijing will formally sign a fisheries agreement on August 3 in Beijing.
To end the long running dispute over East China Sea fishing grounds, the Korean Ambassador to China Kwon Byong-hyon and the Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will sign the first fisheries agreement between South Korea and China.
 According to the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (MOMAF), Chinese vessels will not be able to fish within an area contained by five Korean islands in the Korean West Sea while Korean ships will be able to work within the mouth of China's Yangtze River only for two years following the implementation of the agreement.
 Although the agreement allows Korean vessel to fish in Chinese territory in the West Sea for two years, there are some regulations.
Two kinds of fishing are limited.
Stow net with anchor, where the fisherman throws the net from the boat, and trawling, which gathers fish in a net dragged between two ships, are both prohibited during the summer season from June 16 to September 16 and the number of these types of fishing vessels at other times will be reduced by 50 percent and the number of other types of fishing vessels will be also reduced by 30 percent, respectively, compared to the previous year.
 After Korean fishing stops at the mouth of the Yangtze, China promised to allow Korean vessels to return once the fish population recovers but no timeline has been set at this point.
 A source at MOMAF said, ＂Chinese vessels annually catch 200,000 tons more in Korean waters than we catch in Chinese waters, causing an annual 300 billion won loss to Korean fishers.＂ The two sides had tentatively reached an agreement in November 1998, but after China＇s decision to block Korean fishing boats from entering the mouth of the Yangtze River this March, the official signing of the agreement was delayed.
