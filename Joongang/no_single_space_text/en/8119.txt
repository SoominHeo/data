For the first time in the domestic banking sphere, Hana Bank and KorAm Bank have agreed on a strategic alliance, including plans to spin off information and technology sectors (containing Internet banking) to set up an affiliate.
On the morning of June 27, the two banks signed a memorandum of understanding at the Korea Federation of Bankers building located at downtown Seoul.
They plan to form a joint committee to promote their business partnership in the shortest period possible to discuss proposals and schedules for different sectors.
This alignment is interpreted as the first step for the two banks toward a voluntary merger.
During the signing ceremony, Kim Seung-yoo, president of Hana Bank, said, ＂Our banks have decided on an alliance in order to reduce the immense costs needed in the information technology area through joint investment and ultimately to develop into mutually competitive banks.＂Hana Bank and KorAm Bank had planned to inject 76.7 billion won ($68 million) and 51.1 billion won ($45 million) respectively this year into the information technology area.
KorAm Bank President Shin Dong-hyuck said, ＂With the strategic alliance between the two banks, we will see at least 30 percent cost reduction this year alone.＂In connection with the possibility of a merger, the presidents said that the two banks are ideal partners because they are the most similar in terms of organizational culture among banking circles and both are aiming for steady growth.
They added that the two banks are likely to merge if the partnership proves successful.
