The government has expressed willingness to appropriate a bigger budget for inter-Korean economic cooperation.
The North-South Economic Cooperation Fund in particular is likely to benefit with an increase of 500 billion won ($450 million) - if the proposal from the Ministry of Unification is accepted.
 The Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB) disclosed on June 13 that if visible results are seen after the inter-Korea summit meeting, it plans to comply with budget requests from the relevant ministries as fully as possible.
 However, an MPB official said, ＂Even if a dramatic change of course takes place in economic cooperation, the prospect is that an enormous fund will not be necessary right away.
Therefore, it is unlikely that a supplementary budget will be drawn up this year.＂ Accordingly, the MPB plans to give priority to increasing the North-South Cooperation Fund by 500 billion won, which was recently requested by the Ministry of Unification.
 If the 500 billion won is added to the current reserve of 530 billion won ($477 million), the available revenue will grow to the level of 1 trillion won.
This fund is likely to be used for building the infrastructure necessary for inter-Korean economic cooperation.
