The Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) announced on June 4 that they are investigating possible insider trading by majority shareholders at the LG Group, including its CEO and his family members, who purchased large amounts of stock in LG Electronics prior to a public announcement of the merger involving LG Electronics and LG Telecom.
 ＂We have been keeping a close eye on stock transactions made by each of LG's major shareholders, including the CEO and his family members.
Their total share in the company rose from 6.85 percent at the end of last year to 14.16 percent now.
With the announcement of the merger, we will investigate for possible insider trading," said a source in the KSE.
 ＂We are investigating the CEO and his family, such as Chairman of LG Electronics Koo Bon-moo, who were aware of the merger.＂ A total of $180 million worth of stocks have been purchased since last February by the shareholders under investigation.
 ＂The LG Group has increased the share of its majority shareholders in order to establish a responsible management system and to organize the complicated share distribution between its affiliates,＂ said a source close to the LG Group＇s restructuring head office.
 He added, ＂Majority shareholders at LG Chemical have increased their stake in the company from the end of last year (5.65 percent) to the present (6.07 percent).＂  ＂Shares that the majority shareholders have purchased will not be sold outside of the company and are not to gain any kind of margin.＂  The Financial Supervisory Service will conduct a detailed investigation if the KSE's allegations, which are unconfirmed as of yet, are proven.
