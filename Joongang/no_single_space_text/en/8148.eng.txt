As a result of soaring international oil prices, Korean oil companies will most likely raise oil prices 
Consequently, June’s domestic oil prices are expected to be the highest in history.
 Last month, international oil prices stood at $22 per barrel (Dubai product).
This month prices jumped to $25 per barrel, equating to an increase of 40 won per liter.
The government also increased the national transportation tax by 39 won.
 Domestic oil companies claim that due to their compliance with the government＇s price stabilization policy their profits have deteriorated.
The companies will watch the movement of international prices until May 25, and then a preliminary calculation to finalize the extent of the planned increase will be carried out.
The oil companies want to reflect some or all of the international increase in oil prices, taking into consideration the scale of the anticipated decrease in consumption.
 An industry insider said, ＂If all of the upward pressures on prices are reflected in next month’s domestic oil prices, it will be too much.
Companies might begin a price war.
However, even if we reflect only 50 percent of upward pressure, oil prices will exceed their highest ever level.＂ Until now, the record high was 1,257 won, set in December of 1999.
 Currently, SK Oil, LG-Caltex Oil, and Hyundai Oilbank offer the same price, while S-Oil offers a lower price to consumers.
