Five areas, including Pusan, Kwangyang and Inchon Port, will be designated tariff-free trade zones before the end of the year.
 The Ministry of Finance and Economy finalized the necessary conditions for tariff-free trade zone designation Thursday, and announced that it will designate free trade zones as soon as the requirements are approved in a cabinet meeting sometime this month.
The new measure is part of the government’s attempt to develop the nation＇s key harbors and airports into international logistics centers.
 All in all, five places - three harbors (Pusan, Kwangyang and Inchon), one airport (Inchon International Airport), and one cargo terminal (Yangsan container depot in South Kyongsang Province) - satisfy the conditions set by the ministry to be designated as free trade zones.
The ministry determined the designation requirements based on the conditions of the location including size of the area and its cargo processing capacity.
 Areas designated as tariff-free trade zones will be exempt from tariffs and value-added taxes levied on imported cargo.
Inbound and outbound cargo will also be able to be loaded and unloaded without going through any customs procedures, and can be moved to other ports for loading after simple processing.
 Foreign-invested companies operating within the free trade zones will also receive reductions in indirect taxes, such as corporate tax, income tax and acquisition tax, as well as in rental fees for state-owned properties.
 Kim Kyo-shik, tariff system manager at the Ministry of Finance and Economy, said, ＂The tariff-free trade zones to be designated this year will be different from other foreign logistics centers such as Singapore and Rotterdam, which are actually bonded areas where the tariffs are merely held back.
In contrast, the free trade zones in Korea will enjoy both direct and indirect tax benefits.＂ The free trade zones will be designated later this year after local autonomous bodies submit applications during July and August and these are evaluated
