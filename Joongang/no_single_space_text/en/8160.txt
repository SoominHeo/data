Existing oil refineries expressed strong opposition to the plan to introduce an electronic business system to the distribution of oil products, which comes close on the heels of online automobile sales.
They claim that the new system will disturb the distribution order.
The clash between online and offline companies is now coming to a head.
 According to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) and related business circles on May 9, four refinery firms, including SK and LG, delivered their stance that pushing for e-business excluding refinery firms, which have been in charge of domestic supply until now, may bring about a confused situation.
Recently the Korea Petroleum Development Corporation has been working toward the opening of an ＂electronic oil market,＂ an e-commerce system for oil products.
 Four oil companies plan to submit a proposal to the MOCIE after summarizing their position concerning the possible side effects of the introduction of e-commerce to the distribution of oil products and its impact on the government＇s oil industry policy.
 However, independent importers, who do not have their own refining facilities, and non-poll gas stations, which do not belong to a refinery firm, welcome the introduction of e-business.
A figure from this sector commented, ＂Oil refineries are against e-commerce because they want to maintain their vested interests.
With the introduction of the new system, a huge improvement is expected in the domestic distribution system for oil products.＂ Some gas stations are moving to switch their suppliers to foreign refineries via e-commerce.
It will be interesting to watch how the battle between the large refineries and small businesses advocating e-commerce develops.
