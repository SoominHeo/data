Massive-scale investigations will begin next month into the status of fees collected by eight groups of licensed professionals, including lawyers and tax accountants.
 The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced Tuesday that it will conduct the investigations in five large cities, including Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju and Taejon, to help consumers make more rational choices.
Scheduled to continue until December, the investigations will cover lawyers, licensed tax accountants, certified public accountants, patent attorneys and veterinarians, among others.
 The FTC will commission consumer groups, and academic and research institutions to conduct the investigations.
They will select 100 to 300 professionals per licensed group to conduct spot checks.
The results of the research into fees collected by each group of licensed professionals according to region will be announced at the end of the year.
 They will be the third set of investigations since the fixed fee criteria for licensed professionals was abolished in February last year.
 According to the results of the survey on the status of fees conducted both in May and November of last year, there were up to 20-fold and 30-fold differences in the fees for the same task, depending on the licensed profession.
