Chong Wa Dae spokesman Park Jun-young has announced that President Kim Dae-jung will have a dinner meeting with former president Kim Young-sam on May 9.
  This is the first time that the two will have met privately since President Kim was elected in December of 1997.
Kim Young-sam, who is currently visiting the U.S., will return May 6.
  Spokesman Park said President Kim had planned to invite Kim Young-sam to the April 25 morning meeting which brought together many former Korean presidents.
However, Kim Young-sam was visiting the United States at the time and could not attend.
Park added that both Kims’ wives would attend the May 9 dinner meeting at Chong Wa Dae.
  President Kim plans to discuss the recent agreement between the two Koreas to hold an inter-Korea summit, and to ask Kim Young-sam to relate his experiences trying to organize South-North summit talks in 1994.
  After meeting with other former presidents at Chung Wa Dae in July of 1998, Kim Young-sam had until now refused all of President Kim’s previous invitations.
