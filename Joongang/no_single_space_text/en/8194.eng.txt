North Korea＇s General Secretary Kim Jong-il has reportedly sent a personal letter to Chinese leaders inviting one of them to North Korea, including President Jiang Zemin, through Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun, who visited China recently.
According to diplomatic sources in Beijing on March 30, Minister Paek delivered the letter to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji when they met on March 20.
In the letter, General Secretary Kim emphasized the tradition of exchanges between the two nations, strongly requesting a Chinese leader＇s visit to North Korea; President Jiang, Prime Minister Zhu, or Lee Peng, chairman of the standing committee of the National People＇s Congress.
It is known that in particular, General Secretary Kim expressed his intention that he would welcome President Jiang＇s visit, if he could come, any time under any conditions.
General Secretary Kim＇s letter shows that North Korea has actively come forward to improve ties with China.
This move draws attention because it hints at North Korea＇s future direction in foreign policy.
With regard to this, China again informed Minister Paek, through Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, that it would be happy to have General Secretary Kim first to China.
Prime Minister Zhu plans to visit Seoul in October to attend the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), and President Jiang is scheduled to tour six nations in Europe and Africa in April.
Therefore, at president, Chairman Lee Peng＇s visit to North Korea appears most likely.
