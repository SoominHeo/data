Officials close to Chairman Chung Mong-koo held a press conference on March 26, under a veil of secrecy.
 The press conference was held at Seoulâ€™s Chosun Hotel at 2:30 p.m., with reporters being informed only 30 minutes prior to its start.
The secrecy was an attempt 
False information of a delayed start was also planned 
 The Chosun Hotel was chosen as the site for the press conference, after Chung Mong-hun sealed off entrances to the Hyundai main office in Kye-dong, Seoul, claiming that the security system was under repair.
 The current feud between the two brothers is a result of restructuring at Hyundai, with both brothers claiming leadership of the group.
 After meeting with Honorary Chairman Chung Ju-yung on March 26, Chung Mong-koo gathered presidents from Hyundai Motors and announced that he had been re-appointed as group chairman, reversing an earlier decision by the company.
