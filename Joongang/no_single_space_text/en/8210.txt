Chon Chol-hwan, governor of the Bank of Korea (BOK), warned Thursday that the Korean economy could enter a period of stagflation if international crude oil prices maintain their current high level for the next two or three months.
The BOK held a meeting of its policy-making Monetary Policy Committee Thursday and decided to keep the call rates for March at the current level.
BOK governor Chon said at a press conference after the meeting, ＂International oil prices are currently the greatest variable in making monetary and credit policy decisions.＂ He also warned that if oil prices continue to remain high for the next two or three months, not only Korea but also the entire world could experience stagflation.
Governor Chon added, ＂The BOK has analyzed that $20-24 per barrel is the highest oil price Korea can support.＂ He went on to say that high international crude oil prices are not causing consumer price increases for the moment, nor creating heavy fundamental inflationary pressures.
＂Despite last month＇s hike in call rates, long-term interest rates have dropped slightly and the bond market remains quite stable.
As such, we have decided to maintain this month＇s call loan rates at the current level.＂The governor also expressed concerns over the sharp increase in imports and the current account surplus shrinking more rapidly than expected amidst the domestic economy＇s continuous growth.
He also worried about a slight increase in consumer prices starting in February.
He hinted at the possibility of an immediate hike in interest rates when there are inflationary pressures
