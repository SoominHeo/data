Last month an office worker, 23, identified only as “A” saved his troubled sister, 16, who suffered from mental and physical torment at a so-called ‘ticket Dabang.’ A ‘ticket dabang’ is a place where middle-aged men hang around and sometimes ask young female waitstaff for sexual favors.
For A’s sister, an e-mail service was her saving grace.
 At the end of last year the man heard that his runaway sister was working at a ticket dabang in a small town in the country.
 “At first,I was really frightened by the thought that the owner of the place might take revenge on me,” said the brother.
Thus, he did not dare contact the police; instead, he visited the Internet homepage of the Commission on Youth Protection (www.youth.go.kr.)
at the end of January.
  The brother first linked up with the site “Talking with the chairperson” and left a message asking for help.
The commission immediately responded, saying, “Getting your sister out of that place is top priority.
Please let us know where she is - the name of the dabang, the city, and the contact number.
Any information you give us will be confidential.”
             However, the whole situation caused the brother such mental anguish that he could not respond to the commission for ten days.
The commission sent another e-mail and pursuaded him to answer saying, “We need to save your sister and root out employers who illegally hire minors.
You need to file a report.”
      Finally, the man sent an e-mail message with the address of the dabang.
With the help of the police, the Commission on Youth Protection immediately raided the place and succeeded in sending the man’s sister and three other girls home.
The owner of the dabang was charged with violations of the Youth Protection Law.
  On March 5 the Commission chair said, “A lot of reports are being made via e-mail thse days.
We are trying our best to solve the problems, but we need more reports from the public of youth in trouble.”
