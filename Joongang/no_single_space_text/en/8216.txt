Local Internet company, Thrunet, recently paid 6 billion won (about $5.3 million) for Internet domain name “KOREA.com”.
This is not the only instance of a Korean Internet company taking over ownership of a “Korean” domain name.
Companies from Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong recently fought for ownership of North Korean website domain “DPRK.com,” and a Korean company won out.
  North Korea is considered one of the worst Internet blind spots in the world.
An American, who prefers to remain anonymous, was the previous owner of “DPRK.com” (North Korea’s official moniker is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea).
Negotiations began when local Internet trading company Chosun Internet decided to buy the domain name before starting an Internet business with North Korea.
Chosun Internet ran into problems, however, when it was discovered that a Hong Kong Internet company and a Japanese domain broker were already dealing with the former owner.
  Two foreign companies offered so much money to the former owner for the site that Chosun Internet simply could not compete.
However,the local company played its final card, the so-called ＂Korean Connection.＂ They explained the special relationship between South and North Korea to him, stressing the fact that they already owned “DPRK.net” and “DPRK.org”.
Chosun Internet’s main argument was that in order ＂to improve North-South relations, the South Korean company should own the North Korean domain.”
The former owner agreed and accepted payment of $2 million.
  Beginning in March, Chosun Internet will operate a North Korean portal site on “DPRK.com.”
They are also planning to collaborate with North Korea to establish an Internet business.
Chosun Internet president You Se-hyun said, ＂Once we sign a cooperative e-business contract with North Korea, we will hand over the domain to the North Korean Internet authority.＂
