The recent murder of a nine-year girl by a sex offender in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang, raised an alarm on sex crimes.
More than five million have logged into the Web site www.sexoffender.go.kr, which provides information on sex offenders with criminal records over the past four days.
But anyone who has tried to visit the site will have sworn at his or her computer.

It’s not because the traffic is too heavy, but because of the complicated procedures of downloading the Microsoft Explorer browser and ActiveX Internet security device to access the site.
One has to repeat the process as it rarely works the first time.

After the user finally gets onto the Web site, he or she is required to type in a certified registration code.
It is shameful that the government thinks that it has done its duty simply by designing such a crummy Web site.

The information on sex offenders is also pitiful.
What’s the point of the site if all you get are blurry pictures and approximate addresses of the offenders?
What parent with a daughter can live at ease with so little information?
If the government were really intent on preventing sex crimes, it would provide valid and clear information that is easily accessible.
We should be able to know exactly what sex criminals look like and if any are living among us.

There is data on around 2,000 sex offenders who committed crimes after Jan. 1, 2010, since the related law took effective.
There are numerous more with criminal records before then that are freely running around.

The government should increase the amount of information to ease the public’s concerns.
The government shouldn’t risk violating constitutional rights of privacy, but it should consider stretching the information provided within a permissible scope before revising the law for the sake of enhancing the safety of youngsters.
What is imperative is public safety and protecting our children from predators.
