The Constitutional Court has ruled that levying the comprehensive real estate taxes on a married-couple basis is unconstitutional and that levying the same tax on homeowners whose primary purpose is to reside in their homes is in discord with the Constitution.

When an act or a law is ruled “in discord with the Constitution,” the law remains effective only temporarily in order to prevent confusion in society.
Technically it is the same as being unconstitutional.
The Constitutional Court explained that levying taxes on a married-couple basis discriminates against married couples and is against the spirit of the Constitution to protect marriage and the family.

The court also judged that blindly applying a progressive tax rate to those who own homes for residential purposes, and therefore have less tax-paying capacity, limits citizens’ property rights excessively.

We accept the Constitutional Court’s ruling as natural and reasonable.
The government and political circles must respect this decision and draw detailed follow-up measures.
