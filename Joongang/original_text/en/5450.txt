Today is the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Korean army.
Our army, which was once heavily dependent on the United States even for small arms, is now the world’s ninth strongest army, backed 

The raison d’etre of the national army is to defend the country and protect citizens’ lives and property.
To do this, the army needs to be equipped with advanced armaments.

The army has a range of cutting-edge weapons, such as the K-2 tank, F-15K fighter jet and the Aegis combat system.
It will be further strengthened with the introduction of an early warning system and unmanned reconnaissance planes.

However, Korea should not be satisfied with its existing conditions considering the challenging security situation it faces.
Above all, North Korea’s nuclear weapons pose a substantial threat.
The army must determine how to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction, which outdo conventional weapons at a stroke.

From a long-term perspective, the growing armaments being amassed by Japan and China are also a threat.

In addition to top-notch weapons, having a fighting spirit plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of a war.
Soldiers must take pride in the fact that they are doing a job for the nation.

Therefore, the public must understand that the army is a group of combatants who are willing to sacrifice themselves anytime for the nation.
People must know how much they owe to the army and give acknowledgement accordingly to our servicemen.

In addition, the evil practice of the government misusing the army must be stopped.

An army affected by political affairs is nothing but a house of cards.
