A North Korean spy who disguised herself as a North Korean defector was arrested by the security authority for violating the National Security Law.

She has been living in South Korea for eight years and was accused of involvement in espionage.
The rumor of a North Korean spy posing as a defector has become a reality for the first time, it seems.
She allegedly trained with North Koreaâ€™s State Security Department to be sent to South Korea as a spy.

This news shows just how two-faced North Korea is as it cooperates with the South on the one hand, but runs espionage activities on the other.

However, the government should take into consideration an argument raised 

The government should carefully review the ongoing process to modify clauses in the National Security Law.
The law, which was set up following the confrontation between South and North Korea, is needed, but some of the more ambiguous clauses should be modified to suit the spirit of the Constitution.

An investigation into espionage to protect the foundation of the Republic of Korea and freedom of ideology should be dealt with under different laws.
