Vacation season has come.
We are exposed to routine commercial images in the media that urge people to get out of the city and enjoy the summer.
The roads to popular vacation destinations have turned into parking lots.
It is ironic that people escape from the city to relax, but end up exhausted, both physically and mentally, before they even arrive at their destination.

The advent of the railroad marked the beginning of commercial tourism.
German writer Wolfgang Schivelbusch analyzed how the railway changed the essence of travel in “The Railway Journey: The Industrialization and Perception of Time and Space.”
Rail travel destroyed the concept of time and space in the days when people traveled on foot or by carriage.
The rapidly passing scenery lacked concrete reality and presented a meaningless panoramic impression.
As individual regions become a part of the bigger rail network, regional cultures lost their unique auras.
Travel became a straight and speedy movement from origin to destination.

As overseas trips became more popular, governments started control and surveillance systems on foreign tourists.
Thanks to the advancement of technology, we can now not only read on our journeys but take care of business on the move.

Literary critic Jeong Yeo-ul wrote, “Today, travel has become a preparation for work, or an extension of boring routine.
An escape from everyday life in the truest sense, being able to connect with people and the culture of our destination and dreaming of a different self, is no longer valid in the modern era.”
In his writings on the beauty of daffodils, photographer Kang Un-gu wrote, “A journey is not just to wander or to swarm around in a group.
Sometimes, the truest moment of travel comes when you squat in front of a flower and spend all day appreciating its beauty.”
 We should keep the spirit of travel in our minds as, out of habit, we leave for vacation.
