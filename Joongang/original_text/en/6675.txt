In 1997, Korean sports newspapers created a new position, a Major League Baseball correspondent, whose job was to cover Park Chan-ho of the LA Dodgers, the first Korean major leaguer.
The correspondent was to cover Major League Baseball overall, but it was clear he was sent to the United States mainly to cover Mr. Park.

Professional golfer Pak Se-ri’s nickname is the “Barefooted Queen.”
 In July 1998, she took off her socks and swung at the ball in the water hazard during an extended game at the LPGA U.S. Open in her first year with the LPGA.

The golfer Ms. Pak is also stuck in an extreme slump.
She has been struggling even more because she once had been at the top of her game.
However, Korean fans believe that Ms. Pak will open her heart and come back much stronger, just as Mr. Park has done.
