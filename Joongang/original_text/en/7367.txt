Tsuneo Watanabe, 77, president and chief editor of the Yomiuri Shimbun, a newspaper with the largest circulation in Japan, recently contributed an article titled “A friendly and frank talk with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.”
  In the article, the author called Mr. Koizumi, “just a bourgeois child from Keio University,” “a politician of short-term slogans” and “a politician who prefers Kabuki to reading.”
Not surprisingly, the article became a hot topic of conversation in Japan.

Mr. Watanabe, who also heads an association of Japanese newspapers, can be called a “half-politician.”

Mr. Watanabe also helped Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister of Japan, be appointed minister of science and technology in 1959, according to “Journalism and Power,” by the journalist Uozumi Akira.
Perhaps it was possible for him to speak with “frankness and friendliness” to Mr. Koizumi since Mr. Watanabe is such a powerful figure.

The case of Mr. Watanabe is a peculiar one and it has caused disputes throughout Japan.
