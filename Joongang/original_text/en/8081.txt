Heavy rains and strong winds are expected to grip the nation on Sept. 16 as the year＇s 14th typhoon, Saomai, moves northeast from North Cholla Province through the Korean Peninsula.

＂Saomai, which is now located near Sogwipo, Cheju Island, is proceeding northeastward with winds of 15 km per hour.
The entire peninsula will likely be affected by the morning of Sept. 16,＂ said the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).

The peninsula is likely to be hit by winds of up to 20 km per second and as much as 200 mm of rain beginning the morning of Sept. 16.

The government issued a typhoon alert throughout Korea, asking orchards to harvest their fruits in advance and prepare measures against wind damage and flooding.
They specifically asked people living near the west and south coasts to prepare for flooding by seawater, and take shelter from possible landslides.

Typhoon Saomai is expected to head toward North Korea through the central part of the peninsula, and start to dissipate over mainland China on Sept. 17.
As a result, the central part of the Korean Peninsula will not likely be affected
