Hyundai Asan chairman Chung Mong-hun, now busy with inter-Korean economic cooperation projects, is reportedly directly helping to foster amity between North Korea and Japan.

 On the morning of September 14, Chung informally met North Korean envoy Kim Yong-sun in Seoul.
Chung expressed his views about Hyundai＇s North Korea projects and relations between the North and Japan.

  According to a source from Hyundai, Chung informed Kim that he had confirmed, at the September 12 meeting with Japanese prime minister Mori Yoshiro, that Japanese companies will actively invest in North Korea projects.
Chung reportedly requested that North Korean authorities fulfill the investment guarantee agreement and follow international customs when Japanese capital contributes to the construction of the Kaesong industrial complex.

  The business sector reckons that Chung is acting as an intermediary for amity between North Korea and Japan, because the Japanese government proposed the meeting between Chung and Mori.

  Accordingly, Chung＇s next visit to the North on September 25 to meet Chairman Kim Jong-il is conjectured to be connected to relations between North Korea and Japan.
Chung had promised to meet again with Kim Jong-il when he visited the North in August 8.
Hyundai expects a final agreement to be be reached on the general projects, including the Kaesong industrial complex, at the September 25 meeting.
