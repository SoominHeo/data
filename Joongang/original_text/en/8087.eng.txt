The prosecution has tentatively concluded that the illegal loan scandal at Hanvit Bank resulted from a ploy devised 

Some have raised the concern that the prosecution is prematurely drawing the case to a conclusion without discovering who was behind the scheme.

The Seoul District Public Prosecutors Office announced on Monday that the funds borrowed from Hanvit Bank were used to finance ArcWorld＇s business projects or to repay the company＇s debts, effectively discounting the rumor that the funds were funneled into political channels or that there were pressures from above.

The prosecution will officially announce its findings later this week.

The prosecution interrogated Park Hye-ryong on September 4 as to why he visited Hanvit Bank Vice President Lee Su-gil and whether he asked Lee to stop the probe into the illegal lending.

Park reportedly testified that he asked Lee to halt the probe into the loan at the request of Shin, the branch manager.
The prosecution will shortly summons Lee once again and question Lee, Shin and Park face-to-face.

An official at the prosecutors office said: ＂Considering that Shin recklessly withdrew funds from some 200 bank accounts and provided illegal loans in return for bribes, it appears that Shin and Park Hye-ryong masterminded the crime.＂
