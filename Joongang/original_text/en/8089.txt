It was reported that former Daewoo Group Chairman Kim Woo-chung visited Pyongyang in the utmost secrecy in early August.

 A close attendant of Kim said on September 1, ＂He went to Pyongyang through Beijing, China on the invitation of North Korean authorities.
Then, he returned to Germany where he stayed.＂ The source went on, ＂I cannot say the definite date,＂ adding, ＂Kim did not inform me of where and whom he visited and what he did in North Korea.＂ A government official, well acquainted with Daewoo Group's affairs, said, ＂I was told that Kim visited North Korea, but have not yet found out what the aim of his visit was.＂ A businessman, a former executive of the Daewoo Group, said, ＂I heard that Kim is planning a new business abroad.＂ He added, ＂If he visited Pyongyang, it might be in relation to the business and North Korea.＂ Kim established a joint plant between Daewoo and the North Korean authority, which produces clothes and bags, in Nampo, North Korea in August, 1996 when he was the chairman of the Daewoo Group.
Currently, the plant is only 50 percent operational due to the Daewoo crisis.

 The Kim's attendant stated, ＂Kim is healthy enough for trips abroad.＂ Adding, ＂He has visited Vietnam twice since last February.＂
