A recent study on the industrial structure of the domestic economy indicates that the economy has become less conducive to competition as industrial concentration has tightened following the 1997-1998 economic crisis.

 The study was conducted by the Korea Development Institute under a commission by the Korea Fair Trade Commission.
Over 591 companies in the manufacturing and mining industries were surveyed; their respective market shares were used to derive the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI), which measures the degree of market concentration in an industry.

 To produce the HHI index, the respective percentage market shares of each competitor in an industry are first squared and then summed.
A figure under 1,000 is usually satisfactory, while a figure between 1,000 and 1,800 indicates a market that is moderately concentrated.
A figure over 1,800 denotes a market in which competition is severely restricted.
Any transaction that increases an industry's HHI by over 100 points raises antitrust concerns.

 The HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market and approaches zero when a market consists of a large number of firms of relatively equal size.
The HHI increases both as the number of firms in the market decreases and as the disparity in size between those firms increases.

 The study found that the HHI for Korea's manufacturing and mining industries was 1,650 for 1997 and 1,920 for 1998, reversing a steady slide from 2,580 in 1981 to 1,930 in 1991 and 1,620 in 1996.

 ＂We saw a lot of companies defaulting and eventually going out of business during the recession,＂ explained Fair Trade Commission Antitrust Bureau Kang Dae-hyung.
＂That left industries with fewer competitors, which in effect heightened market concentration.＂ Among the companies with 500 billion won or more in production, 44 are in industries with HHIs of over 1,800.
The Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corporation showed the highest degree of control over its sector.

 The results also show that the combined production of the top 100 corporations represent nearly half of Korea's entire industrial output.

 The top 100 of the 77,309 companies in the manufacturing and mining industries represented 48 percent of the market in terms of production and 21 percent in employment in 1998, which is a marked increase from 40 percent and 18 percent respectively in 1997.
