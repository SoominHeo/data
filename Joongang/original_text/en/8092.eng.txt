The Ministry of Planning and Budget said Tuesday that it has completed an audit of 42 government-operated funds and 20 other types of funds in February, in collaboration with an evaluation panel comprised of 32 civilian experts.
The six-month audit marks the first in the forty years since the funds were formed.

 The audit revealed that 46 funds out of the total 62 funds have been poorly managed.
In other words, 3 state-run funds out of every 4 are financially poor as a result of mismanagement.

 The evaluation panel ranked each fund in four aspects, including asset management, business operations and administration, on a scale in which A was the highest rating and E was the lowest.

 Of all funds, those aimed at public financing, advancements in scientific technolgy, industrial accidents prevention and national healthcare were ranked D.

 The fund for advancements in scientic technology was canceled after only two years following its establishment in 1997, when the relevant branch of the government didn't have a clear idea on how to operate the fund.

 In addition, 14 other funds, including the pension fund for government employees, were described as being far behind the average in terms of their stability and operations.

 "The outcome of the audit will provide a guidline on how to resolve problems at those public funds," says an official at the Planning and Budgetary Ministry.
