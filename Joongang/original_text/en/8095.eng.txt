Government inspectors have found blowfish imported from China containing high levels of lead.
This follows recent discoveries of crabs laden with lead from China, and has prompted the government to require that all fisheries products imported from China go through metal detector tests.

 The Korean government held a policy coordination meeting on August 25 and decided to strengthen measures against illegally processed fisheries imports.

 The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries announced on August 25 that it had inspected 22 cases of blowfish from China.
On average it found that one to two blowfish per box contained between six and 40 lead fishing pieces.

 A ministry official said the fish were probably weighted with lead by Chinese merchants to increase profits.
He also said that there was a possibility that imported croakers and angler fish also contain lead and that the government would conduct further investigations.

 The fisheries ministry will discard all fish found to contain lead after thorough inspections.
