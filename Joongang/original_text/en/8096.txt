In line with the government＇s plan to introduce financial holding companies, financially troubled merchant banks such as Yeungnam Merchant Banking Co. and Asian Banking Co. will become subsidiaries of holding companies.

 The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced on August 24 that unsound merchant banks will be supplied with public funds before they are forced to merge with Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC).
The government then plans to turn the KDIC into a financial holding company.
The ultimate outcome that the government is seeking is for these merchant banks to eventually be spun off as securities companies or to merge with financially sound banks.

 The two merchant banks currently under consideration are Yeungnam Merchant Banking Co. and Asian Banking Co. Central Banking Co. and Korea Merchant Banking Co may be included pending investment talks with Australia＇s Armco Financial Consortium.
In the case of Korea Merchant Banking, an agreement is questionable as Hana Bank, the merchant bank's majority shareholder, has indicated uneasiness with the proposed 45 billion won capital increase.
Meanwhile, a special committee will be formed within the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to evaluate the performance of the merchant banking industry.
The proposed new committee will go into operation early next month, and will be comprised of partners from accounting firms and business professors.
The committee will be charged with objectively reviewing the merchant banks＇ prospects for recovery before the Ministry＇s proposed plan is implemented.

A Minstry of Finance and Economy source said, however, ＂we believe the capacity for the merchant banks to attract loans is considerably limited, and the plausible resolution is for them to enter investment banking or to merge or be acquired
