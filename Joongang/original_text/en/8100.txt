The Kyongju of 1000 years ago is no longer a place that exists only in legends or in the imagination.
People can now visit the Shilla Dynasty capital in virtual reality.
The biggest virtual reality theater in the world will serve as a time machine that transports people to the Shilla dynasty during its most prosperous period.

 The theater will be featured at the upcoming ＇2000 Kyongju World Cultural Expo,＇ which runs September 1 to 10.
The virtual reality venue has a 650 spectator capacity.

 The movie ＇Into the Breath of Sorabul＇ will convey the audience from the dynasty's early stages to its humble end.
The movie accurately reproduces the great Shilla capital Kyongju of 1000 years ago.
Guests can walk around downtown Kyongju and behold the pagodas and famous structures.

 During a scene in which a wagon moves along a country road, the theater seats jiggle and rock to create the impression that the guests are actually riding in the wagon.
When guests encounter a flower, a machine emits that flower's fragrance.

 The effect produced by a virtual reality theater is very similar to the process of dreaming.
When we dream, our bodies lie still on our beds, but we seem to be actually seeing and doing what occurs in the dreams.

 Guests experience the Kyongju of antiquity with all five of their senses thanks to this remarkable technology.
For a virtual reality experience, special glasses and seats are necessary.

 The theater was built by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.
Development expenses ran about $6 million (6.6 billion won).
The theater will remain open to amaze audiences after the Expo ends.
