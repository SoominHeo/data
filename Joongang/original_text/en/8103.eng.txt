The Samsung Economic Research Institute (SERI) on August 16 selected 10 problems facing the domestic economic and social sectors as priority issues to be dealt with by the government.
The most important problem facing tha nation according to SERI is the dual problem of a credit crunch and the delay in restructuring the financial sector.
The slow pace of normalization for companies under workout programs was also cite as an important business problem.

 As for the macroeconomic issues, SERI warned that the economy, which has made a speedy recovery after the foreign exchange crisis, could cool down rapidly.
SERI also pointed out that the domestic economy might undergo another foreign exchange crisis, if foreign capital flows suddenly reverse due to weakened export competitiveness of the traditional manufacturing industries.

 The imbalance in prosperity between the semiconductor industry and other manufacturing industries was designated as the most important industrial problem.
SERI also cited the collapse of the venture business boom as another problem facing the economy.
SERI advised that the venture collapse should be quickly settled through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A;) between venture companies.

 SERI also cited the ongoing feud in the medical sector due to the health care system reforms and the increasing number of labor-management disputes as the primary social problems.
SERI also proposed that a fund for inter-Korean economic cooperation should be quickly established and that the laws and institutions relating to inter-Korean cooperation should be revised.
SERI insisted that, "These problems will not be settled with makeshift solutions as they have accumulated over the decades and cover various ministries of the government and interest groups.
Accordingly, the issues should be solved through systematic measures.
