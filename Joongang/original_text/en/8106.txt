A one-kilometer long fiber optic cable was laid last week in Panmunjom between 'House of Peace' in South Korea and 'Unification House' in North Korea - the two sides have already established fiber optic links from Panmunjom to their respective capital cities.

 The fiber optic network will be up and running at the end of August, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of National Unification, Lee Kwan-se.

 The network is capable of handling 300 telephone lines, 1 television line (45Mbps) and more than 5 digital lines for text, voice and image transmissions.
The use of fiber optics will allow for live broadcasts to be transmitted between the two countries without the need for satellite equipment.

 "The network will be used to communicate political and administrative matters such as the military hot line that was agreed upon at the inter-Korean meetings," said spokesman Lee Until the fiber optic network is ready, inter-Korean communications will rely on the existing 22 copper cables in addition to the 2 Red Cross hot lines.
