The government is now reviewing plans to construct railway stations and check-points to service the soon to be reopened Trans-Korea Railway.
At the recent inter-Korean ministerial level talks an agreement was reached to reopen the Kyong-eui line that runs from Seoul to Sinuju on the China-North Korea border.
The government plans to construct guard posts on the South Korean side of Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) where the railway line will be reconnected.

 On August 6, a government official familiar with the plans stated, "We definitely need inspections of trains that will be traveling between North and South.
We will discuss our plans for construction of a railway station and check-points during the upcoming South-North ministerial-level talks on August 29."
The officlal added, ï¼‚We are planning to station military forces at the check-points.
The check-points might be managed in the form of an administrative office if the amount of goods transported between the North and the South increases."
The government is also discussing this issue with the UN, which has been supervising the DMZ since the end of the Korean War.
It has been reported that the UN also acknowledged the neccessity of constructing check-points inside the UN administered zone.

The military estimates that there are 1,000,000 mines along the 155 mile stretch of DMZ.
In addition, 100,000 mines are thought to exist along the section where the inter-Korean Kyong-eui line will be reconnected.
