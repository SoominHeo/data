An official from the Unification Ministry reported on August 3 that the South Korean government will start restoration of the trans-Korea railway from September, 2000 and hopes to complete the ptoject within a year.

Regarding the agreement at the South-North minister-level talks in Seoul, ＂Both sides will begin construction and renovation as soon as details are agreed upon,＂ said Hwang Ha-su, director at the Ministry of Unification.
＂A second minister talk is scheduled for August 29-31, but preparations for construction could begin even sooner,＂ he added.
Therefore it will likely begin in September.

＂The government plans to set aside 50 billion won for construction of 12 kilometers of the South Korean section of the line (from Munsan to Changdan).
The remaining 8 km in North Korea (from Changdan to Pondgdongni) should be handled by Northern authorities, but any requests for aid will be considered,＂ Hwang explained.

To aid the North, the South Korean government plans to establish a joint railway management corporation.

＂We expect to finish construction within a year.
There is a possibility that the North will use their army as a labor force,＂ he added.
