Korea will no longer be regarded as a developing country with regards to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) once the WTO finishes Korea's TRIPS Agreement review on June 30.

 Accordingly, the WTO has begun reviewing Korea＇s domestic laws concerning property rights.
In the future, if these laws violate the WTO agreement, Korea may be sued.

 On June 29, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) disclosed that Korea＇s property rights-related laws are being reviewed by the TRIPS Council in Geneva from June 26 to 30.
According to TRIPS regulations, effectuated in 1995, Korea was given the status of a developing nation until this year.
With this status, Korea was protected from being sued, even when it broke the agreement.
After the completion of the ongoing deliberations however, Korea will no longer be considered a developing nation.

 A MOFAT official said, ＂Since late last year, we have been refurbishing laws related to property rights, such as the Property Rights Law and the Computer Program Protection Law, to a higher level than that specified by the TRIPS Agreement.
We believe that the review will be completed without difficulty.＂ The TRIPS Agreement is one of the three major agreements of the WTO, the two others being the agreement on goods and the agreement on services.
In 1996, 30 advanced nations passed their deliberations, and the rest, which received the status of developing nations, will be reviewed this year and next.

 Korea is being reviewed by the WTO this year along with 13 other nations, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, and Mexico.
