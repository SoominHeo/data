On June 23, Lee Joung-binn, minister of foreign affairs and trade, had talks with American State Secretary Madeleine Albright at the Central Government Complex.
They discussed policy coordination plans between South Korea and the United States after the inter-Korea summit in Pyongyang.

 The two exchanged opinions on the United States Forces in Korea (USFK) and North Korea＇s nuclear and missile issues, which were discussed during the Pyongyang talks, and confirmed the stance that the cooperation between South Korea and the United States is important for the successful promotion of future North Korea policy.

 Secretary Albright then paid a visit to Chong Wa Dae, where President Kim Dae-jung explained the position of Kim Jong-il, chairman of North Korea＇s National Defense Commission, concerning North Korea＇s nuclear program, missiles, and the USFK.

 President Kim pointed out that the improvement in relations between North Korea and the United States would be helpful for the inter-Korean relationship.
He went on to evaluate that the U.S. Government＇s lifting of sanctions against North Korea, announced on June 19, would contribute to drawing North Korea into the international community.

 In the evening Minister Lee and Secretary Albright held a joint press conference for domestic and foreign journalists.
