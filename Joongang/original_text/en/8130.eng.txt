As a result of inter-Korean summit talks, the spread on Korea＇s currency stabilization bonds plummeted yesterday in international financial markets.

 According to the Bank of Korea on June 13, the day of the Korean summit, the spread on 10-year bonds fell to 2.12 percent from the 2.26 percent rate from the previous day, more than a 0.1 percent drop in a single day.

 By contrast, the spread on the same bonds rose to 2.60 percent on May 29, when rumors of the Hyundai Group＇s liquidity crunch first surfaced.

 In connection with this, the IDEA, an international investment firm, said in its June 13 daily report that the Korean summit is likely to have a positive effect on the Korean economy in the mid-term.
The company predicted that the spread on the currency stabilization bonds will fall to less than 2.00 percent, due to the diminished risk in investing in Korea as a result of the summit.
The firm also predicted that the Korean composite stock index would rise to 1.100 points and the foreign exchange rate to 1,080 won to the dollar by the end of this year.

 Other major foreign investment firms, such as Merrill Lynch and the CSFB, issued a comment on June 13 that they were closely watching the results of talks, explaining that news of the inter-Korean summit meeting has been a favorable factor for investing in Korea since April.
