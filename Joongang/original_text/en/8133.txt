On June 9, Kremlin officials announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would soon visit Pyongyang to have talks with General Secretary Kim Jong-il of North Korea.

 The Kremlin reported the news through ITAR-TASS, saying that National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Jong-il officially invited President Putin and that he would be the first Russian leader to visit North Korea.
No Soviet heads of state have ever visited North Korea.

 Russian officials did not mention when President Putin would go to Pyongyang, but ITAR-TASS reported that it would happen around mid-July.
On the same day, the Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) also reported President Putin's visit without mentioning precise dates.

 A Russian foreign ministry source said, ＂President Putin would like to visit China and North Korea before he attends the G-8 summit in Okinawa on July 21, and on his way home he hopes to visit South Korea as well.＂ The source said that Putin＇s scheduled visit to North and South Korea has not yet been finalized.

 Before the official Kremlin announcement, Japan＇s Kyodo News Service reported on June 8 that President Putin is highly likely to visit China on July 18 and North Korea the next day on his way to the G-8 summit.

 A Russian government official said, ＂South Korea＇s Foreign Minister Lee Joung-binn will visit Moscow on June 28 to discuss President Putin＇s schedule to visit South Korea and the situation on the Korean Peninsula, after the Korean summit.＂ In February, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov paid a visit to North Korea and signed a friendly cooperation treaty between the two nations.
In April, North Korea＇s Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People＇s Assembly, and Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun paid a return visit to Russia.
