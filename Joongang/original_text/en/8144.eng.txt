A Nepalese worker has filed a lawsuit against the Korean government and the Chongnyangni Mental Hospital for $73,000.
Chandra Kumari Gureung was accused of being mentally ill and forced into a mental hospital against her will.

 In her lawsuit, Gureung stated that the police did not even check her identification before forcefully placing her in the Chongnyangni Mental Hospital.
When she was transferred to a mental hospital in Yongin, she told hospital officials her name and passport number but the Korean Immigration Office still insisted she was an unidentified person, which delayed her release from the mental hospital.

 Gureung said she is seeking mental and material compensation for mistakes made by involved public officials and doctors.

 Gureung came to Korea in February of 1992 as a member of a foreigner industrial trainee program and worked at a textile factory in Seoul.
In November of the same year, she got into an argument with a restaurant owner and was arrested by the police, who then sent her to a mental hospital.
She remained in the mental hospital for just over six years and was freed in March thanks to the efforts of a human rights group.
