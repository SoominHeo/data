Korea＇s business delegation has left for an official visit to Taiwan for the first time since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in 1992.

 Seven people representing conglomerate organizations -- including the chairman and vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries -- and representatives of venture firms left Seoul on May 19 on the occasion of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian＇s inauguration scheduled for May 20.

 The Korean businesspeople were invited by the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry and business groups.
On May 20, after attending the presidential inauguration ceremony, the Korean representatives will participate in events to celebrate the inauguration including a dinner for state guests hosted by the Taiwanese presidential office.
The next day, the Korean businessmen are scheduled to have dinner with their Taiwanese counterparts to discuss ways to cooperate.

 Taiwan unexpectedly invited Korean information technology venture representatives to the inauguration, heralding an exchange between Internet firms of the two nations.

 The six venture representatives were invited to Taiwan; Lee Chan-jin of DreamWiz, Park Hyung-jin of Hacker＇s Lab, Lee Keum-yong of Auction, Park Channg-ki of Paxnet, Kim Hong-sun of Secure Soft, and Hwang Eu-taek of Inknara.
Soon after their arrival in Taiwan, they met Taiwanese venture capitalists and Internet service providers.

 A Korean consular official in Taiwan said, ＂The Internet firms of the two countries asked us to arrange as many meetings as possible.
I understand that Korean venture capitalists will individually hold investment seminars for Taiwanese venture capitalists.＂
