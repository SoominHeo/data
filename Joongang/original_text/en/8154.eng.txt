The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) announced on May 16 that it would formally request the correction of a report entitled ＇Evaluation of Korean Chaebol Enterprises’ made 
It claims the evaluation was made incorrectly because S&amp;P; misunderstood the methods of debt ratio calculation.

 The FKI explained its position, saying, ＂S&amp;P; has diminished the credibility of the Korean economy to a large degree by making incorrect evaluations without a proper confirmation of debt ratio, volume of debt, or the size and nature of assets.”
In the case of debt ratio calculation, S&amp;P; points out that Korean enterprises have used a simple averaging method which lowers the whole group’s average debt ratio by lowering their sister companies＇ debt ratios.
However, the FKI refuted the assertion that local companies＇ debt ratios were calculated according to a weighted average system which divides the total debt of sister companies by the total assets.

 The FKI also denied the claim in the S&amp;P; report that Korean companies lowered their debt ratios to a level under 200 percent by reevaluating their total assets.
According to the FKI, the average debt ratio is 173.9 percent excluding the four largest conglomerates＇ reevaluation difference, and 147.4 percent including the difference.

 The FKI also insisted that S&amp;P;＇s claim that the Korean conglomerates did not control the exchange of stocks between their sister companies on the point of the debt ratio calculation was groundless.
