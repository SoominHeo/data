A researcher at the Korea Development Institute (KDI), a state-sponsored think tank, asserts that corporate and financial restructuring and systemic reforms should take place before Korea can enter an American-style new economy, which is characterized by low prices and a high growth.

 In a report entitled ＂The American Stock Bubble and The New Economy＂ made public on May 4, researcher Sung So-mee wrote that, ＂The conditions that enabled America＇s new economy to take off were the implementation of restructuring over a long period of time, organizational and technological renovation, a stable monetary policy, and efficient market mechanisms.＂ Ms.
Sung said, ＂As Korea has maintained a relatively low price hike rate while achieving a dramatic economic recovery after the foreign exchange crisis, some predict that America＇s new economy will expand in Korea.
However, it is too early to expect a new economy after making efforts for restructuring and seeing improved macroeconomic indices for a year or two.＂ Last year＇s high growth rate (10.7 percent) means a recovery from a negative growth in 1998 (6.7 percent), which cannot be compared to America＇s nine-year boom, insists Ms.
Sung.
After the foreign exchange crisis, Korea＇s annual growth rate for two consecutive years stood at 2 percent.
Therefore the low price hike rate (1.5 percent for the first quarter of this year) is not unusual.

 Ms.
Sung said, ＂For Korea to enter a new economy, government-led banking must disappear as soon as possible and efforts must continue to make the financial market efficient and healthy, so that markets are allowed to play their inherent function -- the efficient distribution of resources.＂ She maintains that some advanced nations, including the United Kingdom, evidence signs of a new economy, but the phenomenon of a new economy is still salient only in the United States.
