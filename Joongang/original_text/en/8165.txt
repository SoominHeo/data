The government has decided to offer liquidity support to the ailing Hyundai Investment Trust &amp; Securities Co., only if the Hyundai Group finances 1.2 trillion won in investment losses through self-help measures to normalize the management of its financial unit.

 Lee Ki-ho, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, said at a press conference Wednesday, ＂The government has decided on the principle of offering financial assistance only if the Hyundai Group takes self-help measures to make up for the investment trust unit＇s shortfall in net capital [1.2 trillion won].＂ He added, ＂To my knowledge, Hyundai＇s major shareholders are currently reviewing a variety of measures, including contribution of their own holdings in non-listed stocks.＂ This marks the first time for the government to specify the exact amount that the Hyundai Group would have to finance on its own as the prerequisite to financial support from the government.

 Presidential secretary Lee also said, ＂Approximately 40 trillion won in public funds is expected to be further necessary to rehabilitate Hyundai＇s investment and securities unit, including 30 trillion won to resolve existing insolvent obligations, and 10 trillion won in incentives for merger with a bank.＂ As the government has promised not to create any more public funds requiring parliamentary approval, he said, it would come up with the necessary money by retrieving as much of the 64 trillion won already injected in public funds as possible.
The government also plans to finance the necessary money in the form of the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC) taking out loans from financial institutions.
The senior presidential secretary said the finance-economy minister would preside over a meeting with other related ministers next week to discuss concrete ways to secure additional public funds.

 The Hyundai Group, whose founding family has shown reluctance to contribute private wealth to help rehabilitate its investment trust unit, also announced for the first time Wednesday that the owner family would make joint contributions of funds with majority shareholders and Hyundai affiliates to resolve the crisis in its financial arm.

 A senior Hyundai executive said, ＂We are currently reviewing the possible contribution of private wealth
