Seoul Broadcasting Station (SBS) has decided to expose entertainers acts of prostitution in its investigative news program ＂News Tracking＂ to be aired at 10:55 on May 2.
In response, entertainers threatened to boycott SBS programs and expose the irregularities found within broadcasting circles.
It appears that the tug-of-war over this show is likely to spread into an all-out war between the broadcasting station and entertainers.

 Park Chul, television actor and the vice chairman of the Korea Broadcasting Entertainers＇ Labor Union (KBELU), visited Ahn Sang-ryun, head of SBS‘s ＂News Tracking＂ on the afternoon of May 1 and demanded that the program not be aired.
Park said, ＂If you air the program without offering any evidence that the subjects are entertainers, and even if they are, without telling the viewers for how long they were in the entertainment business, it may put all entertainers in a compromising position.＂ Mr. Park said, ＂If SBS broadcasts this program as planned, we will consider a strike at the level of the KBELU, and we will expose the broadcasting station＇s irregularities; how some producers accepted bribes, how they asked entertainers to sleep with them, and how they raped some entertainers.＂ He added, ＂In the case of the rape, we are currently talking with a witness to secure evidence.＂ Television Actor Kim Ki-bok, the KBELU secretary general, said, ＂This case is harmful both to the broadcasting station and entertainers.
Depending on the contents of the broadcast, we will expand our protest.
We will demand the punishment of the staff in charge and our members will refuse to appear in any SBS programs.＂ With regard to the entertainers＇ complaints, SBS Team Head Ahn Sang-ryun said, ＂We have already announced the upcoming program, so it is too late to cancel it.
The contents may be fatal to the entertainers in question, so their identities will be protected by disguising their voices and blurring their images.
Their names will be withheld and even their initials will not be used.＂
