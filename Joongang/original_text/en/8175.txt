Talks between Samsung Motor Creditors and French Automaker, Renault, have come to an end after 4 months of ongoing negotiations.

 On April 20 and 21, representatives from the two parties held a fourth round of negotiations in Paris and decided not to extend the deadline for the sale of the troubled Korean auto company.

 The two sides were at loggerheads, with Renault offering to buy Samsung Motors at $540 million and Samsung creditors asking for more than $600 million.

 Yoo Han-jo, director of Hanvit Bank, a major creditor of Samsung Motors, says, ＂Renault indicated that it would not extend the price negotiation deadline.
Accordingly, Samsung creditors plan to make a final decision on Renault＇s proposal after consulting with other creditors early next week.＂ The sale of Samsung Motors will go through if a minimum of 75 percent of creditors approve the plan.
A high-ranking official disclosed that the creditors would share the sale of the motor company with the Samsung Corporation at a 7:3 ratio, respectively.
He hinted that creditors could be open to a compromised price of $570 million.
