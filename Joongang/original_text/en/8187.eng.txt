The entire nation was trapped under a dense cloak of yellow sand when the seasonal winds carrying yellow dust blew eastward from China to the Korean Peninsula Friday, after covering Beijing with yellow dust the previous day.

Seoul began to be blanketed in yellow dust early in the morning.
By the afternoon, visibility was reduced to a mere 1.8 km.

Citizens had difficulty breathing in the dense dust particles carried by strong winds, which blew at a maximum velocity of 14.4 meters per second, and the dust settled thickly on the roofs and window frames of buildings and cars.

According to the meteorological observatory on Mt.
Kwanak in Seoul, the total density of suspended particles of dust (TSP) measured 177.2 ug/cubic meter at 11 a.m., 17 times higher than the dust density on clear days (10 ug/cubic meter).

The Korea Meteorological Administration (KDMA) explained, ＂The yellow sand that had gathered above the Gobi Desert near the national boundaries of China and Mongolia Wednesday was due to low atmospheric pressure and was carried via strong westerly winds and created sandstorms in Beijing on Thursday before reaching the Korean Peninsula.＂Today＇s yellow sand, the fifth occurrence this year, was particularly bad in Korea＇s central regions.
The visibility in Chunchon was reduced to 2 km, 3.5 km in Suwon, 3 km in Wonju, 3 km in Sosan, 12 km in Mokpo and 13 km in Kwangju.

KDA predicted, ＂The yellow sand is expected to abate by Saturday morning, but two or three additional yellow dust storms could take place in April as the dry weather continues in China＇s northern regions.＂The KMA advised citizens to refrain from going outside as the yellow sand carries metallic pollutants, including sulfuric acid, nitrates, and manganic acid and advised that people should also wash their hair upon returning home.
