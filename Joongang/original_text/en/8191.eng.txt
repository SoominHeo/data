President Kim Dae-jung’s chief security adviser, Hwang Won-tak, said if talks between the two Koreas improve relations, South Korea’s government will guarantee the loans that North Korea has borrowed from various international organizations.

 During a press conference on April 3, Hwang said that if there were any ways in which South Korea could help the North, that it would be done, not because South Korea can easily afford it but because the two countries share the same blood and culture.

 Hwang also added that there were a lot of talks going on through various channels dealing with economic cooperation and the problem of divided families.
But he said he could not confirm whether the talks are between government officials.

 President Kim’s chief economic adviser, Lee Ki-ho said during the press conference that $646 million from the Korea Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) and $136 million from the North and South Korea Economic Cooperation Fund and $36 million from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) can be used to help North Korea purchase southern made products thereby creating a special procurement boom.
