The Korean invasion of the Major Leagues has begun.
With Park Chan-ho leading the way in 1994, Cho Jin-ho of the Boston Red Sox and Kim Byung-hyun of the Arizona Diamondbacks have followed.
With Park scheduled to be the number two starter for the Dodgers and Kim assured of a spot on the bullpen, all eyes are on the Koreans.
There are currently fourteen Koreans in the minor leagues.

 Despite the fact that Park is winless in the preseason, he is confident that he will do well this year behind Kevin Brown.
Parkâ€™s first start is against Hideki Irabu and the Expos.

 Adding a slider and a sinker to his 150 kilometer an hour fastball, Kim Byung-hyun is looking foward to being the first Korean to pitch in the postseason.
The Diamondbacks finished first in their division last year and are expected to do well again this year.
During spring training, Kim earned the nickname, Dr. K, and the respect of Manager Buck Showalter.

 The Korean trio of Lee Sang-hoon, Cho Jin-ho, and Kim Sun-woo could be called up to the Majors.
The Bosox will probably bring up Cho and Kim if the starting rotation shows signs of collapse.
Lee could see action in the Majors as a reliever against lefties.

 Korean hitters are also shooting for the Majors.
Trying to be the first Asian batter to make it to the big leagues, Choi Hee-seop, playing in Double A, has a good chance of playing for the Chicago Cubs.
Bong Joong-kun of Atlanta, Song Seung-joon of Boston, and Paek Cha-seung of Seattle, are now in Single A. Kwon Yoon-min of Chicago and Chung Young-jin of San Diego will play their first year in America.
