Union members of Kookmin Bank filed a suit with the Seoul District Court Tuesday to nullify the appointment of Kim Sang-hoon as the new bank president and chief executive officer, claiming that a general stockholders＇ meeting never took place.
They also applied for an injunction against Kim to suspend him from performing his duties as the new bank chief.

The union claimed in the court petition, ＂Although the general stockholders＇ meeting was scheduled to take place at 10 a.m. on March 18, it was blocked by the union＇s protests.
Kim Sang-hoon was elected as the new president and CEO at another meeting which took place without informing shareholders of the change of venue prior to the meeting.
His appointment should be nullified as the proper procedures were clearly ignored.＂ Kookmin Bank had originally planned to hold a general stockholders＇ meeting on the morning of March 18 and elect Kim as the new bank president.
The meeting had to be relocated to the office of the acting president and CEO late Saturday night as union members had blocked the original venue for the shareholders＇ meeting to protest what they perceived as the government＇s attempt to control the banking sector.
