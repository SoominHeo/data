In response to U.S. measures against Korean-made line pipes, the Korean government is expected to take aggressive action and bring the case to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

  The U.S. decided in February to impose additional, successive tariffs of 11 to 19 percent on line pipes imported from all nations except Mexico and Canada for the next three years.
The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy (MOCIE) revealed today that it has collected opinions from related Korean industries and the predominant view is that filing a case with the WTO is inevitable.

  MOCIE believes that U.S. regulations on the import of line pipes violate international codes of conduct.
The ministry has decided to file a suit with the WTO which will notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of its decision.
