Standard Telecom, a Korean telecom equipment manufacturer listed on the over-the-counter KOSDAQ market, has raised $50 million from European and Hong Kong investors by issuing overseas securities.

 The company floated $35-million-worth of convertible bonds (CBs) and $15-million-worth of bonds with warranty (BWs) overseas, payment of which will be completed on March 28.
Each of the bonds can be exercised at a strike price of 15,000 won (three months after issuance) with a non-guaranteed five-year maturity at an annual coupon rate of 0 percent.

 Foreign investors acquired the new stocks in Standard Telecom at a 15-percent premium, marking the first issuance of overseas CBs carrying a premium by a Korean company since the economic crisis that began at the end of 1997.

 Chang Bom-jin, company section chief, said, ＂We managed to issue bonds carrying a premium by persuading investors that our shares are undervalued compared to company technology and growth potential.
Standard Telecom was the first company in Korea to develop a key chipset for mobile phones based on global system for mobile communication (GSM), the European digital cellular standard.＂ He added that Standard Telecom plans to use the new capital raised through overseas-issued CBs to develop next-generation mobile communication technology.
