Business circles have abandoned their planned political activities designed to influence the April 13 general elections.

 Cho Nam-hong, executive deputy chairman of the Korea Employers Federation (KEF), announced on March 20, ＂We have completely revamped the plan for evaluating former and current assemblymen as well as other candidates prior to the elections.
Instead, we have decided to evaluate their parliamentary activities after the elections.”
The KEF plans to evaluate assemblymen who are likely to affect management-labor relations.
For example, those in the Environment and Labor Committees will be closely monitored following the formation of the 15th National Assembly.

 Mr. Cho said, ＂With the general elections only a few weeks away, it is difficult to evaluate those running due to constraints on time and materials.
We decided that it will be more effective to evaluate how much of a contribution elected lawmakers provide towards the development of a market economy and for peaceful relationship between management and labor.＂ Business circles held the first meeting of the Parliamentary Political Evaluation Committee, which deals with political activities, on February 28.
At the meeting, the KEF decided to evaluate candidates for the upcoming elections based on their inclinations, attitudes, and ability to generate policies in a comprehensive way and to inform 2.85 million business people of their results.
