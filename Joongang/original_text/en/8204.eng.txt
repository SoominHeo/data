With the scheduled opening of the Technology Exchange market on April 7 comes the formation of a group of professional technology dealing companies to lead local technology dealing markets.

 These professional technology dealers are agencies which seek out and various technologies through the Technology Exchange, in the same way as stock dealings are made through the ＇Stock Exchange＇.

 The Korea Technology Dealers Association (KTDA), composed of 25 separate companies including the Korea Intellectual Property Exchange and Techtrans Korea, held a ceremony in Lotte Hotel in Seoul on March 15 to mark its inauguration.

 Members of the KTDA are planning to lead technology dealing markets to act in concert with the opening of the Technology Exchange, through listing as technology dealing firms.

 Besides the dealings made through the Technology Exchange, these member companies will congregate in an ＇off-board market＇ where dealings between members are made.
It is anticipated that these movements will help to commercialize high-technologies so far little known.
The size of the local technology exchange market this year amounts to $224 million.

 The Technology Exchange is to be established as part of the ‘technology transfer promotion law’, with total funds of $16 million, including a $11.5-million injection from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy and the Bank of Commerce.
The Technology Exchange will deal in technologies through the professional technology dealing firms and the technology dealers listed on the Exchange.
It will charge a commission of 5 percent.
