China＇s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will have a positive influence on Korea＇s trade balance, according to an analysis announced Monday (13 March) by the Bank of Korea (BOK).

 BOK said results of a study on the effects of China＇s ascension to the world trade governing body showed that Korea＇s trade balance with China would rise by $2.4 billion during the period of from 2000 to 2005.
Its trade balance with other countries, excluding China, will drop by $1 billion, however, improving the nation＇s overall trade balance by $1.4 billion.

 Korea＇s exports to China are expected to increase by $2.7 billion, thanks to eased tariffs and other trade barriers in China, and imports from China will likely rise by $300 million as well.

 Korea＇s trade balance with the ‘Big Three’ - the United States, Japan and China - will fall by $1 billion, caused by rising imports of goods necessary to support greater exports to China, BOK analyzed.

 Korea is expected to benefit from China＇s entry into the WTO because trade between Korea and China is based more on a complementary relationship rather a competitive one.
In fact, only 18 percent of the nation＇s exports are less competitive than Chinese products or are in rivalry against the latter in international markets.

 BOK nevertheless cautioned that the Chinese industry would acquire a greater competitiveness in the long-term with the liberalization of its markets, and that this would ultimately intensify its competition with Korea.
Korea will need to actively prepare for the eventual rivalry by developing higher quality products, BOK said.
