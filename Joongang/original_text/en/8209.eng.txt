Cho Sung-mo, 15, son of legendary Korean swimmer Cho Oh-lyun, is following in his father’s footsteps.
He has earned a spot on the national men’s swim team.

  During high-level meetings with the administration committee, Cho was chosen to be part of the national swim team in long distance freestyle.
This decision was announced by the Korean Swimming Federation on March 12.

  Cho will try for his first medal at the Sixth Asian Championships in the 1500m freestyle event to be held from March 27 to April 2 in Pusan.
This will be the first time in Korean swimming history that both a father and son have represented the nation in swimming.

  Sung-mo’s best event is the 400m and 1500m freestyle, the same events that his father won back-to-back in the 1970 and 1974 Asian Games.

  Cho Sung-mo won the 1500m freestyle in the Donga Swim Meet held in July 1998.
This was only his first year of competitive swimming, and his success shocked people in the local swimming world.
He was given a place on the team that same year.

  Last year he went to Carson City, Nevada, to refine his skills; this is also where his father trained during his glory days .
And earlier this year, he earned a spot on the national team with a magnificent time of 15:59.40 in the 1500m freestyle at the Santa Clara Circuit Swim Meet.
As a comparison, the Korean record for this event was 15:40.40.

  At 170cm and weighing in at 65kg, Sung-mo says that he wants to be a world champion, something that his father failed to achieve.
He added that he first wants to participate  at the Sydney Olympics and win at the Pusan Asian Games slated for the year 2002.
