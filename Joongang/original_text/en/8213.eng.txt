Seoul National University (SNU) is getting a lot of attention with their attempts to retrieve property, worth $260 million, that has been in use by the U.S. Army since the Korean War.

 On March 6, SNU made clear their intentions to reclaim the 44,028 square meters in Uljiro 5-ga in Chunggu, asking the U.S. Army and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) for a ‘cancellation and return of the property.’ SNU confirmed this last month and has taken steps to reclaim the property through the national property department in the Ministry of Finance and Economy.

 The property in question was formerly a College of Education and an attached elementary school for SNU.
The U.S. Army’s Far East Command took over the area on June 1, 1951 with a special requisition (urgent order #6) and the site was used by an engineer corps.
The ‘special order’ was replaced later with the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).

 SNU officials have said that, “Officials under the U.S. Far East Command and construction companies licensed by the U.S. 8th Army have been using the $260 million property.”
SNU has repeatedly asked the MND and the U.S. Army to return the land, but the answer has always been negative.

 The U.S. Army is not against the return of the property, but both sides are at loggerheads on who should be resposible for moving fees, expected to reach into the tens of millions of dollars.

 SNU believes that since the U.S. has used the valuable property without charge for the past 50 years, the U.S. Army is solely responsible for relocation expenses, but it’s unknown how the MND will negotiate with the U.S..

 Last year, SNU reclaimed land in Yonchongun, Kyonggi Province used by the U.S. Army, to work on flood prevention in the area.
