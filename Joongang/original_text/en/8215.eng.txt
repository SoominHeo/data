Lee Sang-hoon, best known as Samson to his Korean fans, gave up a home run in his Major League debut.

 Lee pitched in an exhibition game at Hammonds Stadium in Florida against the Minnesota Twins on March 3.
He came to the mound in the eighth inning as the fifth pitcher in the game, with the Red Sox down 3-8.
He struck out one, but gave up a solo home run to catcher Matt LaCroy, Lee’s first earned run allowed in the Majors.

 Except for the long ball, Lee’s pitching was aggressive, uncommon for a rookie.
Lee had a good start, forcing Ortitz to ground out to short.
Lee then gave up a home run to left field on a 1-1 count.
He settled down after that and retired the next batter, Jennings, with a ground out to short.
Lee struck out Maxwell to end the inning.

 Lee is scheduled to pitch next on March 7, against the Texas Rangers.

 Elsewhere, Japanese pitcher Ohka Tomokazu gave up only one hit in one inning, with no runs allowed.
He had a better start than the Korean trio of Cho Jin-ho, Kim Sun-woo, and Lee Sang-hoon.

 The Red Sox lost the game against the Twins 9-3.
The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the first, scoring 3 runs off starter Brad Radke, but Boston starter Tim Wakefield gave up the lead, surrendering four runs in the first.
