The e-commerce patent application process is to be shortened to 15 months from the current 24, the Korean Industrial Property Office (KIPO) announced on February 28.
They will put the e-commerce application process on a special fast-track system, so the applicant can receive earlier notification of the outcome.
The change should become effective within this year.
Currently, nine patent application categories are fast-tracked, including environmental and export-related applications.

 KIPO will also impose detailed regulations on e-commerce-related applications within the year.
There have been demands made for special guidelines for the expensive and time-consuming e-commerce applications, to replace current standardsfor ＇computer-related patents＇, and to fall into line with U.S. and Japanese regulations.

 An officer at KIPO said, ＂We are focusing on creating new laws, mainly for the Business Model (BM) authorization system and security system.＂  However, some argument over the new standard is expected, for example, whether or not to require a patent for every new model or to limit requirements for those in the BM category which incorporate new technology.
