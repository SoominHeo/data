Considering there are second and third interviews, a good photo does not guarantee a job.
But because of hiring managers who prioritize photos on resumes, many job seekers consider plastic surgery.
Getting hired is often compared to a battle, and when even 1 percent of hiring managers say the photo is important, job seekers will try to satisfy them.


But it is doubtful that 7.8 minutes is enough to select a candidate.

On the first day, I read them thoroughly, but as time went by, I paid less attention and was uncertain whether I was grading the papers accurately.

Even more astonishing was that 4.7 percent of the hiring managers in the survey said that the photo was the most important part of the resume.
