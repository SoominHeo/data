Public outrage over the death in April of a private, identified only as Yun, after being beaten unconscious by a group of senior soldiers in the Armyâ€™s 28th Infantry Division is spreading fast nationwide.

The Army reprimanded 16 senior and noncommissioned officers for their lack of supervision of their soldiers.

A fatal shooting spree at a general outpost in the 22nd Infantry Division in June also resulted from extreme bullying in the barracks.
