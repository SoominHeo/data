I recalled my experiences from the last three years as a Tokyo correspondent after receiving a letter from a Japanese reader two months ago.

The reader described herself as an “average homemaker from Toyama” who has visited Korea more than 40 times.

It might sound like an excuse, but Korea and Japan had their worst tensions over the past three years.

As I complete three years in Tokyo, I am burdened with a greater challenge.
