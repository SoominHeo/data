As the country that will host the 2020 Olympic Games, Japan must handle this human rights issue strictly, the public  said.

The news infuriated me for two reasons.

While hate speeches against Korea have prevailed in downtown Tokyo for more than two years, the Japanese government considers them “freedom of speech” and has not intervened.

I would like to tell Japanese society that there are no two standards for domestic and foreign human rights.
