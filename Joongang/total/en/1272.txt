But the 2012 London Olympics sent us a special message.
The Korean national team won 13 gold medals, fifth after the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Russia.


Korea hosted the event and finished in second place, closely behind China, reaffirming the country’s potential in Asia.

Kim Yu-na’s gold medal in figure skating in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics is a triumph that reassured us that Korea could do better than developed nations.
