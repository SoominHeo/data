President Park Geun-hyeâ€™s speech yesterday commemorating the 71st anniversary of the Liberation Day focused much attention on domestic issues.
More than half of it was devoted to addressing an ongoing social trend of self-depreciation and calling on people to overcome times of economic uncertainty to achieve a second economic leap for Korea.
