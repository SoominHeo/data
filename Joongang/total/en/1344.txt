One month has passed since the tragic sinking of the ferry Sewol.

The joint investigation found that the four senior crew members avoided their responsibility to rescue hundreds of passengers aboard the ship when it was possible.

Though the Navy attached guidelines to the ferry to rescue people trapped inside on the day of the accident, divers only entered the submerged cabins two days later, losing precious time.
