I remember the Taiwanese television news on May 20, the day of Tsai’s inauguration.
The inspection on the fisheries products exported to China — such as turtle eggs and rock trout — were tightened, and the order volume was rapidly decreasing.
Pineapple and other agricultural goods experienced similar obstacles.
It is the “Chinese style” to use fish and fruits to pressure Taiwan.
The aforementioned two cases help us understand what we are experiencing today.
