As a pretentious gesture, Japan also postponed the approval of rightist textbooks from late March to early April.
While it was only moved back a week, some Korean government officials seem to have overly appreciated Japan’s “consideration.”
The highlight of the meeting was President Park’s stern face as Abe greeted her in Korean: “It is very nice to meet you, President Park Geun-hye.”
I replayed that comical scene over and over.
Japanese media also made a fuss.
They juxtaposed Park’s smiling face as she shook hands with Abe ahead of the meeting with her stiff expression during the meeting.
They also argued her expressions were intentional, as she was worried about the Korean public’s unfavorable sentiments toward Japan.
But even if Japan’s claim is true to some degree, it was Abe who started the two-face play first.
He conspicuously visited the Yasukuni Shrine, where Class-A war criminals are enshrined, but claimed Korea and China were responsible for stalled communication, arguing that he was willing to talk.
President Obama had expressed disappointment toward Japan, and Abe greeted Park in Korean in front of President Obama.
In late April, President Obama is to visit Japan and Korea, and a high-level meeting between Korea and Japan on the comfort women issue is scheduled in mid-April.
