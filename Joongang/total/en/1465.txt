Since last April, Bukbu Hospital in northeast Seoul has been running inventive programs combining public health with medical and social welfare services and delivering them to the doors of the needy.

Five social workers are permanently stationed at the hospital.

As of 2010, there were about 1.17 million people at the bottom of the poverty scale who could not get any help from the government because of the income and assets of their legal supporting family members.

A woman and her two grown daughters recently committed suicide at home because they could no longer support themselves.

The tragic story of these three women raised awareness of poverty and the inadequacy of our social security network.
