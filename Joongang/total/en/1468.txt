For common inmates, a day’s work is set between 50,000 won and 100,000 won.
But strangely, during the second trial, the court in Gwangju came up with a historic figure for a day’s labor, worth 5,000 to 10,000 times the normal rate.


Huh was indicted in 2007 for evading 50 billion won in corporate taxes and embezzling corporate funds worth 10 billion won.

The lower appellate court gave Huh the option to work off his fine, setting the value at 500 million won for a day’s work.
