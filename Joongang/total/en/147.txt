Ewha Womans University Medical Center in southwestern Seoul had a tuberculosis scare in mid-July after a nurse in charge of the newborn intensive care quarter was diagnosed with the infectious disease, subjecting hundreds of babies and employees to TB testing.

TB infection cases among hospital staff have been on the rise, reaching 367 last year, up from 294 in 2014 and 214 in 2013.
