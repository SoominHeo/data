South Korea, the United States and Japan are considering a tripartite summit on the sidelines of the March 24-25 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague.

Since Abe has vowed to back up his predecessors’ statements - and considering U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to Seoul in April - Korea is better positioned for accepting the tripartite summit.

Without cooperation among the three allies, the government’s efforts to promote reunification and take advantage of a “jackpot” will be an empty slogan.
