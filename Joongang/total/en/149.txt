From the standards of S&amp;P;, only six regions — Germany, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, all rated AAA — and the United States with AA+ — have credit ratings higher than Korea.

We welcome the vote of confidence by S&amp;P.; As the credit rating agency indicates, Korea’s GDP growth — currently at 2.6 percent — is noticeably higher than advanced economies’ numbers, which are in a range between 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent.
