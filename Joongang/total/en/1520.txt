A dangerous move to deny the 1993 Kono Statement, which admitted and apologized for the imperial Japanese Army’s forcible mobilization of sex slaves during World War II, is alarmingly gaining momentum in Japan since Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga’s bombshell announcement last month that the right-wing Shinzo Abe government will set up a team to scrutinize what happened in the leadup to the Kono Statement.
At a rally in Tokyo earlier this month, the Japan Restoration Party, another rightist faction in Japanese politics, strongly urged Abe to review the previous cabinet’s investigations of “comfort women” in a scheme to revise the Kono Statement.
Yoshitaka Sakurada, a lawmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party and senior vice minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, attended the rally and vociferously denounced the Kono Statement.
“I really hate lying or cheating people or fabricated truths.
I am eager to root for your efforts,” he said.
His remarks translate into the Abe cabinet’s conviction that the Kono Statement was based on victim testimonies that were false.
We are dumbfounded by the retrogression of history acknowledged by a top government official in charge of education policy in Japan.
Sakurada serves as deputy president of the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and Paralympics.
