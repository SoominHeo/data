My cousin emigrated to New Zealand more than 20 years ago.
Around that time, a group of my college friends left the country together.
Their primary motivation was education.
My nephew and niece, who were in elementary school when they left Korea, also graduated from college in New Zealand and now work in Australia and Korea.
While living abroad, my cousin missed Korea, describing New Zealand as a “boring heaven” and Korea as a “fun hell.”
Living in Korea is busy, crowded and competitive, but its society has a unique energetic and dynamic vibe.
Her friends felt the same.
They joked, “If you have money, Korea is the most fun country to live in.”
Some of them returned to Korea after their children grew up.
That, however, is a story of the past.
A recent opinion poll showed 57 percent of people said that they would not want to be born in Korea if they could be born again.
Just 43 percent would choose to live another life in Korea.
Interestingly, 60 percent of people in their 20s said they wouldn’t want to live in Korea again.

March 1 was the historical Independence Movement Day.
