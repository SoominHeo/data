Meteorological experts single out the institute’s meager experience - only six months - in forecasting fine particle smog and its heavy reliance on U.S. weather data as major handicaps.
To raise the institute’s accuracy, the government must first increase mid- and long-term investments in the field.
It must prioritize devising a forecast model of our own that can take advantage of local data from the Korea Meteorological Administration.
Scientists must figure out precisely how the fine particles arrived here and actively work to combat and eliminate such dangerous smog.
The government must also encourage regional environmental agencies to take the lead in studying local smog patterns so that the institute can fully reflect those regional differences.
The authorities also must increase the number of meteorological stations along the west coast in order to obtain enough data about the movement of fine particles to offer satisfactory forecasts.
In addition, through diplomatic channels and scientific exchanges, the government must secure the latest data on China’s emissions.
If the authorities really want to provide pollution forecasts effective at least three days out to help citizens to prepare, scientific research and data accumulation is a must.
