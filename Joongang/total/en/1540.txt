The National Youth Policy Institute published a report on the sleeping patterns of Koreans in elementary, middle and high schools, and said 61.6 percent of the elementary school students were lacking sleep because they were watching adult content.
The study was a part of a human rights survey on 9,521 students in fourth to sixth grades and in middle and high schools.
