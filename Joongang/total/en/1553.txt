If each one of us could do just like she did, we all could say, “I am thrilled and happy,” just like she said after her victory.
As the Sochi Winter Games come to an end, we pay attention to the number of medals each country won.
Team Korea has only won four medals so far, including two golds.
But it has achieved even better results than before - plenty of human stories and anecdotes involving our athletes.
The Winter Games also exposed the shades of our sports, as clearly seen in the shameful rivalry and division of the Korea Skating Union, which cost Korea an excellent short track speed skater, Ahn Hyun-soo, also known as Viktor Ahn, who chose the path of naturalized citizenship of Russia.
That is our loss and our shame.
As women’s speed skating 500-meter winner Lee Sang-hwa said, we need to prove our commitment to winning gold medals.
It is high time for the older generation to help another Shim Suk-hee do well in the Pyeongchang Winter Games four years from now.

Audiences watching the live coverage of the women’s short track speed skating 3,000-meter relay at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi couldn’t take their eyes off the screens on Tuesday.

If each one of us could do just like she did, we all could say, “I am thrilled and happy,” just like she said after her victory.
