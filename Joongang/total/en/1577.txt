Those 124 people were not simply martyrs.
They were pioneers in cultivating human freedom and social equality in the old regime.
Thanks to their sacred sacrifice at the grass-roots level, the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) could eventually move on toward becoming a mature, modern society.
The 124 martyrs send a resonating message to our society today.
