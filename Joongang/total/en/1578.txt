When the owner of the salt farm was asked why he tried to prevent the workers from leaving after enslaving them for more than five years, he bluntly said, “If dogs leave home, I must go out to find them.”
We are dumbfounded that such a brutal and inhuman example of slavery exists today.
The police should be ashamed of the case.
The workers at the farm did not dare look for help even though there was a police outpost near the area.
The local police said they could not imagine that such criminal activities had been taking place in their jurisdiction.
One of the workers posted a letter seeking help and his mother reported the case; the local police, residents and government had either been kept in the dark or stayed silent about what was going on at the salt farm for years.

Human trafficking cases in the area have been sporadically reported in the media since 2006.
