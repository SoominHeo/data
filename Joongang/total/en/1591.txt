In February 1910, he gave it to Masao Shitara, a guard at Lushun Prison.
He brought it back to Japan and admired Ahn for the rest of his life, and the calligraphy was bequeathed to his nephew, Masazumi Shitara.
A few years ago, Park met with Shitara, now the head monk at Gansenji Temple in Hiroshima, Japan, and offered to buy it or exchange it for a Korean calligraphy work that he may want.
But Shitara turned it down, saying, “Ahn wished for my uncle to let the Japanese know that the purpose of the assassination was for the independence of Korea, and therefore the calligraphy should stay in Japan.”
For Seishiro Yasuoka, a prosecutor at the Lushun court that interrogated him, Ahn wrote, “Worrying and Caring for the Peace and Security of the Nation” in March 1910.
