U.S. President Barack Obama’s last-minute cancellation of a tour to Southeast Asian countries last October - albeit a unique case - significantly damaged his purported “pivot to Asia.”
Although Obama made the decision due to a temporary shutdown of the federal government, Southeast Asia perceived it as a sign of growing isolationism in America.
Obama plans to resume his Asian travels in April to overcome some of the ramifications of the canceled trip.
