On Sunday, Jan. 26, I made sure I was in front of the television in the afternoon.
I secured the remote control from my wife and children to watch a game of baduk, a board game also known as Go.
Lee Se-dol, a Korean professional player ranked ninth, and Gu Li, a Chinese player also ranked ninth, were to play a 10-game tournament.


Lee Se-dol, a Korean professional player ranked ninth, and Gu Li, a Chinese player also ranked ninth, were to play a 10-game tournament.

The two players have conquered the world between them, and now they were putting everything on the line.

Two masters played 10 games, and a winner was announced when one fell behind by four wins, with the defeated vanquishing into a life of misery.

I was told a game of baduk was all about spirit and the “way,” but nowadays safety-first is the secret to success.

Most international matches have three-hour time limits, but each round could be four hours for the Lee-Gu tournament.

For the next nine months, I will make sure not to schedule anything else in the afternoon of the last Sunday of the month (when each Lee-Gu game is played).
