On Jan. 20, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called Ahn Jung-geun a “terrorist.”
He needs to learn what “terrorist” means.
English dictionaries define it as “a person who uses violence, especially murder and bombing, in order to achieve political aims.”
Suga claims that Ahn assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Hirobumi Ito for a mere political aim.
But a rebuttal can be found in the memorial.
The 110 items exhibited there represent that the purpose of Ahn’s courageous act was to assassinate the cruel war of aggression by imperial Japan that brought bloodshed in Asia, and that he was seeking peace for humanity.
