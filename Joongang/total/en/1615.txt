However, I did refrain from writing for some 10 years, when I became frustrated with my meager talent.
But even at that time, I was studying and trying to tame my reckless desire and passion.
Now, I don’t think of literature as a tool for my accomplishments; I think I can be a tool for literature.
However, writing is not my main job.
I don’t think I can make a living by writing novels.
The population that uses Korean language is not large enough, and the market for Korean writers is not very big.
More than 30 percent of Koreans do not read a single book in a year, and each person spends less than 20,000 won ($18.60) on books.
So I wouldn’t dare to try and make a living as a writer.
Yet some people hope a Korean Wave in literature, just like K-pop and television dramas, will create more international popularity.
On Monday, the Korean Novelists Association held a new writers’ forum titled “The Globalization of Korean Novels.”
The same day, it was reported that poet Ko Un received the Golden Wreath award by Struga Poetry Evenings in Macedonia.
However, the speaker of the forum and Dankook University professor Kwon Young-min concluded that the poet was pessimistic about any Korean Wave in literature.
The biggest obstacle is the absence of translators.
While the Literature Translation Institute of Korea translates seven or eight novels a year, that does not mean foreign readers will read them.
