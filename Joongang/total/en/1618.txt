After completing the three-month trail, they are sent home.
In fact, I am impressed that the French Ministry of Justice adopted such an innovative idea.
Is the walking trip effective in rehabilitating and correcting juvenile delinquents?
Members of the Seuil Association attended the World Trails Conference last week in Jeju and explained the program.
It costs 900 euro, or $1,220, for each juvenile delinquent to spend a day in a correctional facility, but the Seuil program costs only 300 euro a day.
While the recidivism rate for juvenile offenders is 85 percent, it drops to 15 percent for those who complete the Seuil trip.


It took me 35 years to understand that the threshold can be an obstacle to some people.

That works out to walking 17 kilometers per day on average.

While the recidivism rate for juvenile offenders is 85 percent, it drops to 15 percent for those who complete the Seuil trip.

Each young offender is paired with an adult for the three-month trip, which is why the Seuil program works; the teenager spends three months walking with a complete stranger.
