The Minjoo Partyâ€™s proposal to raise the corporate tax rate for companies with more than 50 billion won in annual revenue to 25 percent is unrealistic.
The share of our corporate tax to our GDP is 3.2 percent, already above the OECD average of 2.9 percent.


That will bring approximately 400 billion won more tax revenue to the government.

Nearly all income earners pay income tax in the United Kingdom, while 15.8 percent of Japanese, 19.8 percent of Germans, and 22.6 percent of Canadians are exempted from the tax.

To meet OECD standards, the party needs to lower the ratio of income tax exemption to less than 30 percent, while creating the new higher income tax bracket at the same time.
