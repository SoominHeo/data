The package was wrapped up hastily with a compromise to increase the payment age to 65 from 60 starting with employees recruited in 2010.
It is no wonder the new attempt hardly sounds credible.
What makes the incumbent government think it will be successful this time?
But if the fix goes up in smoke again, society likely won’t tolerate it.
Pensioners of government employee schemes collect nearly triple the amount of rewards than in the Contribution-based national pension program.
Reforms on other state-funded pensions won’t gain support if the mostly money-losing pension program remains intact.
No government employees would wholeheartedly welcome such a move, which would mean higher monthly contributions and less benefits after retirement.
Yet if civil servants don’t act first, no civilian would agree to the pension reforms.
Government employees are expected to exceed one million this year.
