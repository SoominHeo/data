Korea and Japan are trapped in four issues: territorial disputes, Japan’s denial of history, comfort women and compensation for enforced labor during World War II.

Japan’s direct investment in Korea plunged by a whopping 40 percent and Japanese tourists decreased by 23 percent last year.

About half endorsed military cooperation, including sharing sensitive information with Japan, while 37.3 percent opposed it.

More people (49.5 percent) backed a summit than those who opposed it (40.7 percent), and 57.8 percent even demanded President Park Geun-hye make efforts to improve bilateral ties.
