As the Japanese government was eager to get media coverage, the press was allowed to the courtyard of the main hall, and the reporters were less than one yard away from the prime minister.
The slow steps, relaxed shoulders and firmly clenched fists show that Abe was proud to have finally made the visit.
As I observed Abe at Yasukuni, I thought of President Lee Myung-bak during his visit to Dokdo in August 2012.
He, too, seemed relieved, as if a heavy load had been lifted.
His face showed a kind of accomplishment and satisfaction.
Lee Myung-bak in Dokdo and Abe in Yasukuni are similar, not just in their facial expressions but for the aftermaths of their visits.
Firstly, both leaders advocated economic recovery and pragmatism at the beginning of their administrations.
President Lee Myung-bak presented an economy-first principle, with the so-called 747 vision: 7 percent annual economic growth, $40,000 in per-capita national income and one of the top seven economies in the world.
