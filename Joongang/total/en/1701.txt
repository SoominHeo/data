It is as meaningless to forecast his possibility of winning the 2017 presidential election as it is predicting the weather.
It is also unclear if he will win the Democrat Party primary.
But he deserves credit for building political insight through the last presidential election.
Moon’s recently published memoir on his experience in the last presidential election says his defeat was unfair.
If that was the only thing he wanted to claim, there could be no progress.
But he presented objective analysis on the faults of the election entities.
He mentioned the failure to win votes of the older generation, his passive response on security issues and a lack of an agenda for growth as the tactical causes of his defeat.
If he doesn’t repeat those mistakes again, the possibility of a victory for him will increase for sure.
So it’s quite regrettable that he personally got involved in the controversy of not accepting the last presidential election outcome.
In 2017, it is not President Park Geun-hye he will be competing against.

That’s why I finally felt my impression of Democratic Party’s Moon Jae-in change when I learned that he said at a book publishing ceremony on Dec. 15: “Politics has become my destiny, which I cannot avoid any longer.”

It is as meaningless to forecast his possibility of winning the 2017 presidential election as it is predicting the weather.
