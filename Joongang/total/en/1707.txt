Kundera also cites the case of a poet who was a powerful member of the Communist Party in the 1950s.
He was targeted in a Stalin-style purge, but while in prison he wrote a set of poems confessing his loyalty to Communism.
He was not guilty either.
Kundera analyzed that the poet was not a coward but thought that loyalty to the punisher would reveal his virtue and honesty.
These patterns do not just happen in foreign countries.
North Korea executed Lee Sung-yop and Park Hun-yong for “unspecified espionage charges” to make them accountable for the failed southward invasion of the 1950-53 Korean War.
Trial records show that they admitted to espionage charges.
They may have felt the same way the poet did.
On top of severe torture and fabrication, they may have thought that they could become either loyalists or traitors, depending on where the power lies.
The photo of Jang Song-thaek being dragged into the court with a bruised face and hands shocked us all.
It also made us feel bitter.

Kundera discovered something in common between the cases of the Czech engineer and Josef K. - each one was punished without knowing why.
