According to the testimony, Cho asked the head of the administrative bureau of Seocho District to confirm if the son’s name and resident registration number are correct after sending text messages to him on June 11.
Cho strongly denied the allegation.
The prosecution is considering summoning Cho for further investigation along with efforts to restore the text messages in question.
But the question is why Cho, who’s been managing facilities of the Blue House under the presidential secretary for administration, Lee Jae-man, a core member of President Park’s inner circle, got involved in leaking private information totally unrelated to his job.
The suspicion is that Cho requested the Seocho district bureau chief to affirm the veracity of the information about the son’s family relations.
The suspicion grows even bigger when considering the sensitive timing of the confirmation request, which fell on June 11, only three days before the prosecution indicted former NIS head Won Sei-hoon on charges of violating the law on fair elections.
