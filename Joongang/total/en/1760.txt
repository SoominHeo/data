In 1863, Ito got a secret order from the Choshu Domain and, together with four others, snuck out of Japan to go to the United Kingdom and study.
His stay in Great Britain was a crucial experience in his life and made a great impact on the fate of Japan.
Ito learned about Western civilization and international politics from the most powerful country at the time.
The “Choshu Five,” who included Inoue Kaoru and Yamao Yozo, contributed to Japan’s emergence as a new power.
Celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Five’s secret journey, a memorial to the British couple who helped them on their voyage was erected in London earlier this year, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a letter of appreciation.
While Ito may have been a visionary in the Meiji period, he is only a symbol of aggression to Koreans.
Ito is inseparable to the annexation of Korea to Japan.
Some argue that Ito had opposed the argument for conquering Korea.
However, he was more of a prudent politician who supported gradual progress to wait for the right time in the international situation.
History, from the Eulsa Treaty of 1905 to the full annexation, proves his true color.
In 1909, a patriotic hero Ahn Jung-geun assassinated Ito at Harbin Station, China.
