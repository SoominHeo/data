The prosecution has announced it discovered as many as 1.21 million messages on Twitter posted by the National Intelligence Service staff to meddle in last year’s presidential and general elections.

According to a special investigation team at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, it all began with 26,550 original messages, which were disseminated through various ways, including tweets and retweets, to reach the total number.

Given the large number of the online messages and the professional programs involved, we can hardly buy NIS chief Nam Jae-joon’s Nov. 4 explanation that the online postings were committed by a small group of staff on their own.
