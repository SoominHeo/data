Listed companies subject to routine audits live in fear of the bill they will get once the books are cleaned up.
Of course, the primary responsibility for stopping accounting fraud lies with the companies themselves.
Companies can cook up the books and hide liabilities in many different ways if they want to, leaving their accountants to claim they could not uncover all those dubious practices.
But it is the accounting firm’s job to supervise and check a company’s financial figures to ensure they are correct.
The results of those audits are the only objective criteria investors have for evaluating the companies they buy.
If accounting fraud is tolerated, the stock market will lose the confidence of investors.
The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of shareholders of Forhuman and ordered the computer software company’s accountant, Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers, to pay 14 billion won ($13.25 million) in damages.
This is the first major ruling against an accounting firm.
Over the last three years, accounting firms had to pay a total of 3.4 billion won for partial responsibility and settlements in accounting scandal cases.
