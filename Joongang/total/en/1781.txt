The first one began with the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992.
As toll manufacturers that made shoes and toys relocated their plants to China, investments and exports increased rapidly.
Between 1992 and 1997, Korea’s exports to China increased by an average of 32 percent annually.
The second boom came with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.

We can see the change in the 20,000-word “decision” made at the Third Plenum.
The economic reform in the decision focuses on re-establishing relationships among the government, market and businesses.


The second boom came with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.

Even if an FTA is signed, my outlook is that it will be different from the first two booms.

We can see the change in the 20,000-word “decision” made at the Third Plenum.

Only then we will enjoy the third China boom in Qingdao.
