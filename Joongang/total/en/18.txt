As Hanmi admitted the deal’s cancellation within 24 hours, as required by the securities exchange act, it did not violate the law at all.
However, given the massive impact of the company on overall stock prices of pharmaceutical companies listed on the local bourse, Hanmi must take responsibility for its belated notification of the deal cancellation.
Hanmi provided a reason that only boosted suspicions about the company.
The company explained that it took a longer time to consult with Korea Exchange over the cancelled deal to export its technology to Boehringer Ingelheim.
However, because listed companies are obliged to notify the public about significant changes in their businesses, that explanation does not make sense.
Due to the company’s 30-munite delay in its public notification of the bad news to the stock market, investors who bought Hanmi’s shares earlier suffered a big loss.


Hanmi Pharm demonstrated moral hazard and defied its obligation to respect investors after belatedly notifying them of the cancellation on Sept. 30 of a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany’s leading research-driven pharmaceutical company.

After delivering the good news and bad news at different times, Hanmi Pharm’s stock price fell more than 20 percent.

Due to the company’s 30-munite delay in its public notification of the bad news to the stock market, investors who bought Hanmi’s shares earlier suffered a big loss.

Korean people had high expectations for the pharmaceutical company thanks to its amazing 8 trillion won export of top-caliber technologies for the production of new drugs.
