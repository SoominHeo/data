Korea has indeed outperformed Japan, a country that has an economy five times bigger than ours and which has been a trade surplus nation for decades.
However, we must confront an inconvenient truth behind the outstanding performance of our economy: The laudable achievement was made possible more by Japan’s domestic problems than our own merits.
Japan’s underperformance stems from its rapidly increasing energy imports after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima and the shutdown of nuclear power plants across the country.
Moreover, the steep devaluation of the yen against the U.S. dollar - as much as 40 percent - contributed to the deterioration of Japan’s capital accounts balance.
