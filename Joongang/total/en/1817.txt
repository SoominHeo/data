In 1998, at the height of the foreign currency crisis, Koreans welcomed foreigners willing to invest in Korea.

I was a cub reporter at the time, and I remember the guideline to write about any foreign investment over $100 million.

While foreign investors buy Korean stocks, the Kospi broke 2050 points, and Korean investors would have gladly sold their stocks, ending the nerve-racking wait.

The foreign direct investment has decreased by more than 10 percent this year.
