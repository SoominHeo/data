However, Montgolfier, then head prosecutor in the city of Valenciennes, persistently tracked down witnesses, and Tapie was sentenced to two years in prison.
Montgolfier later recalled that when Tapie appeared for inquiry, he boasted that he had just met with President Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace and would say good things about the prosecutor next time he meets the president.
Later, Montgolfier returned to public attention as he discovered that the judiciary had postponed trials or “lost” investigation files to help wealthy offenders.
It was unprecedented for a public prosecutor to investigate corruption in the courts.
When he was working in Nice in 2009, he had obtained a list of secret account holders at HSBC in Switzerland.


The 67-year-old defender of justice may be the only prosecutor that is a household name in France.

Tapie allegedly ordered his players to contact three players from Valenciennes to help the team win.
