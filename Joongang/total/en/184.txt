The United States established the safety standards for dressers in 2014.
Even when the drawers are opened and the weight shifts to the front, it should stand safely.
When a child weighing over 20 kilogram (44 pounds) climbs up, it shouldnâ€™t tip over.

A committee will be formed to investigate the case and conduct shock test, so it would take at least three months for decision to ban the IKEA dressers from the Korean market.


In the United States, 29 million units were recalled and a ban on sales was decided.

Four months later, in June, the U.S. government banned sales of 32 products of similar designs.
