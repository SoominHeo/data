A government-sponsored national pension development committee recently recommended revising the national pension law to hike monthly premiums incrementally to 13 percent or 14 percent of incomes from the current 9 percent.

Civil servants get paid a pension at 70 percent of their income levels, compared to 51 percent for the regular national pension.
