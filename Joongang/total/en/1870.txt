When the mother of Lee Hyun-il (1627-1704) was pregnant, she did not eat vegetables or fruit whose shapes were not pretty, kept her head down and did not look at other people at a village party.

Various events on prenatal education and childcare were held, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced that each subway car in the Seoul Metro system would have two seats for pregnant women.
