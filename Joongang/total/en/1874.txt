On Sept. 7, the government announced a plan to help small businesses and merchants, desperately wanting to revive conventional markets and mom-and-pop shops.
The plan includes ideas like using big data and encouraging the consumption of local agricultural products grown within a 50 kilometer (31 miles) radius.
The ideas are certainly innovative, but their actual benefits are doubtful.
Most of the merchants in locals markets are old and unfamiliar with smartphones and tablet technology.
The financial resources needed to adopt information and communication technology have not been readied.
The officials say that the budget is not a concern since private corporations like SK Telecom and KT will be involved.
But that makes the government look like it is just following a campaign by the telecommunication companies to revive traditional markets.
The plan to use local food also cannot be implemented easily.
The local food program is based on daily supplies and daily consumption, but even large corporations cannot afford this because of issues such as maintaining freshness and securing a distribution network.
The government plan assumes that processing, packaging and delivering orders in a day is possible with government-sponsored supermarkets and distribution centers.
But 613 supermarkets that receive assistance from the government have already closed.

Despite a variety of plans to help local markets, they suffered a 4 percent decline in revenue.
