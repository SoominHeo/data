Due to my short itinerary, I only visited two islands, Teshima and Ogijima.
I had lunch at Shima Kitchen, a restaurant in Teshima that is an artwork in itself, and viewed Tobias Rehberger’s “What You Love Can Make You Cry” and Susumu Kinoshita’s “101-Year-Old’s Silence.”
Ogijima is a tiny island with a population of 160, and the three hours I had spent was not enough to appreciate 23 artworks.

More than 30 people were injured in the crowd, and the festival left tons of waste.
