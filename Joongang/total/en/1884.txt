He was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1990s.
He was already married at the time and had to bring his 5-year-old child to a university day care center before going to classes.
His child always cried and did not want him to leave, so he gave the child some toys and left while it played.
After several tearful separations, the day care teacher told him, “You have to let the child see reality.
Don’t use duplicitous measures.
The child may cry, but you have to make known the fact that you have to go to school.”
He recalled that he was shocked when the day care teacher added, “You have to finalize the deal clearly.”
He shared another story.
Students and their spouses at the university volunteered at the nursery whenever they could, and he learned a rule from them.
Children covet new or interesting toys.
If one gets to play with a popular toy, others are envious.


Just like oil and water, the two extremes confront each other.
