A few years ago, I was waiting for my flight back home at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport when two men who claimed to be “Koreans who crossed the Aprok River” approached me.

I did not imagine experiencing this once again, especially in Europe.

A Korean immigrant who has lived in the U.K. for more than 20 years said the number of North Koreans working in Korea Town is increasing.

According to the Ministry of Unification, 12 defectors have gone back to the North so far, and two of them defected again, while 10 remain there.
