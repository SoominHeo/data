Since Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-an ordered an internal investigation into Chae’s personal life on Sept. 13, Chae said he will take legal action separately from the investigation to clear his name.
But it is unclear why Chae changed his mind after he stepped down.
The scandal is failing to go away even after Chae’s resignation.
TV Chosun interviewed a woman who allegedly worked as a housekeeper in the woman’s house.
The housekeeper] claimed she saw Chae frequent the house and act as father to Lim’s son.
Chae flatly denied the report.
The society was forced to play witness to the allegations around the prosecutor-general’s personal life for the last three weeks.
