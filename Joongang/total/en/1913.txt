The special committee on judicial reform was launched in April.
It was to take up the mission of reforming the system and reorganizing the prosecution, which was a campaign promise made by both the ruling and opposition camps.
But the bipartisan committee was ridden with one conflict after another.
The ruling and opposition parties were poles apart on institutionalizing outside special prosecutors for high-profile political cases.
The Saenuri Party suggested appointing a special prosecutor every time a sensitive political case emerged, while the Democratic Party insisted on institutionalizing a permanent special prosecution office.
Both sides narrowed their differences on separating an anti-corruption oversight agency from the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.
It is not the first time the Assembly failed to come up with legislation for prosecution reform.
In 2010, during the Lee Myung-bak administration, the legislature mulled establishing a separate anti-corruption agency to investigate senior public officials.
