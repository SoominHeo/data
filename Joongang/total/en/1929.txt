He only got two interviews, which he didn’t pass.
Earlier this year, he finally got an offer from a small company run by the owner and his friend.
The owner promised, “We will have 50 employees in a year,” and Lee did his best.
However, the company soon lost a contract with an advertiser that provided most of its revenue.
Then he lost his job.
His career had a grim start.
But then he saw a recruiting notice from the Walkers, a social co-op, offering a five-month-long program on advertising, marketing strategy and video production.
The program costs 5 million won($4,607), which can be repaid in 25 installments after he gets a job.
He had little hope, but he applied and got into the program.
He began attending classes last month.
Twenty students like Lee dream of a second chance at the Walkers’ third floor office in a fish market building in Mangwon Market, Mapo District.
The average age of the attendees is 30, as they have been repeatedly frustrated in their careers.
