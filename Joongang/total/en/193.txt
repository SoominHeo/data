Among the 34 OECD member countries, Korea is the only nation to give prosecutors the authority of direct investigation, investigation command, indictment and prosecution.
No other country has an organization with a justice minister, ministerial-level prosecutor general and 50 vice-ministerial director-level prosecutors.


It had been one year since I began working in the United States, and I had to renew my driver’s license.

I was to wait two weeks for a call, and of course, no one called me.

Among the 34 OECD member countries, Korea is the only nation to give prosecutors the authority of direct investigation, investigation command, indictment and prosecution.

No other country has an organization with a justice minister, ministerial-level prosecutor general and 50 vice-ministerial director-level prosecutors.

I can deal with a slow DMV once a year, but the “onion prosecutors” have gone beyond our patience.
