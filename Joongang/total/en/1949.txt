The National Assembly Budget Office projects the debt level could exceed 37 percent next year and reach 38.4 percent in 2016, threatening the government-imposed Maginot Line of 40 percent.
When the combined total debt of 392 trillion won at 28 public institutions is included, public sector debt could soon reach 900 trillion won.
