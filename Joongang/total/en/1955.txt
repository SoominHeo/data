High radiation levels were detected at four new locations near the storage tanks.
They are different from the tanks that authorities confirmed last month, which were leaking about 300 tons of contaminated water.

To make matters worse, authorities are rapidly running out of space to store highly radioactive waters that have been used to cool the reactors.
About 1,000 tanks have been built around the complex, but some already have been leaking from their bottoms.
Leakage of radiation is not Japanâ€™s problem alone as it can affect the maritime environment and ecosystem worldwide.

Tritium concentrations in underground waters near the waste tanks spiked up to 15 times more than the level six months ago.
