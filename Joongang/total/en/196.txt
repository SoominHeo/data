It has been 30 years since the 1987 system based on a five-year single-term presidency and small electoral districts was implemented.
In the three decades since, most presidents have not been able to avoid the cycle of glory and expectations followed by lack of communication, trial and error, national schisms and low approval ratings.
The masters of politics, the peopleâ€™s president and the best conservatives are no exceptions.
President Park Geun-hye has one year and seven months left in her term, but like most before her, she has gone down a similar track since taking the helm of the presidency.


When I was a newbie covering the Millennium Democratic Party in 2002, I predicted Lee Hoi-chang would win against Roh Moo-hyun.

After five years of the liberal Roh administration, the presidency was handed over to conservatives.
