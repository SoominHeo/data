I visited the island on Aug. 11 during my business trip to Africa.
Robben Island is a shrine dedicated to preserving the history of human rights activism.
Former South African President Nelson Mandela was imprisoned here from 1964 to 1982.
The entire island is a museum and has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Site.
The island was a leper colony and later became a prison mainly for political prisoners in 1959.

A handsome black tour guide pointed at a cannon and explained, “The encampment was built during World War II, but the construction was so slow that it was completed in 1947, two years after the war ended.”

The extreme incongruity between the scenic island and Mandela’s 18-year-long imprisonment was impressive, but upon returning from the trip, I couldn’t stop thinking about the guide’s joke.

I may be one of those people who has a watch but doesn’t have time.
