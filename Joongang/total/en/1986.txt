We have previously expressed concern about the crisis in filling leadership positions at public enterprises, which has been a major issue since late May.

Six months have passed since the Park Geun-hye government launched, but it is still dragging its feet on appointments.

A government can accomplish a lot in its first year, but the incumbent administration is wasting this precious time.
