The accident occurred on the Jungbu Highway on Aug. 7.
This kind of intimidating driving on the highway is not new.
Every year, more than 30 people are killed in accidents that result from reckless driving and competition for lanes.


I realized how easy it is to suffer an unexpected attack from a total stranger when I started driving some 20 years ago.

I had my worst experience when I was trying to merge as two lanes became one.

I barely avoided driving right into him, but he did it again three times.

Whenever a car tries to pass me, I always let it go first so I donâ€™t become the target of primitive instincts.

The dangerous move resulted in a five-car collision and the death of an innocent truck driver.
