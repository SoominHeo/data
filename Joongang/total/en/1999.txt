The month of August, the Okpo location and the name Kim Jwa-jin are all very significant.
The submarine was launched two days before the 68th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
Okpo is the site where Admiral Lee Sun-shin led the first victory against Japanese forces back in May 7, 1592, about a month after the invasion.
General Kim Jwa-jin (1889-1930), a hero of the armed independence movement in the nation’s modern history, has been resurrected as a submarine to defend Korea by sea.
Kim led the independence fighters in the Cheongsanri Battle in Manchuria in 1920.

By the time they arrived in 1919, the war had already ended.
Understanding the pain of losing a nation, they sold their weapons to Korean independence fighters.
In 2011, the Czech ambassador to Korea exhibited the historical materials in Seoul.
