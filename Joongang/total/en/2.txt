Six years have passed, and when you search “Smile Microcredit Bank,” it redirects to the Korea Inclusive Finance Agency.

As the core initiative of the Park Geun-hye Administration, a major company is in charge of a center in 17 regions to provide assistance and support for startup companies.

The first creative center was established in Daegu in September, 2014, and it’s been over a year since the 17-center structure was completed in July 2015.
