This year, 16 experts from the United Nations and eight countries in North America, Europe and Asia are attending.
On the North Korean side, 130 officials and scholars, including 12 environmental experts, will be at the conference.

But this is a short-sighted opinion.
The conference deals with global environmental issues such as climate change, forest management, waste treatment and water resources management.
For sustainable development, the environment is an indispensable issue.
North Korea may be economically struggling, but it is now starting to think about global issues.
North Korea recently suffered serious flooding in North Hamgyong Province.
According to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, North Korea suffered 200 casualties and damage to 50,000 homes and buildings.
The flood damage shows North Korea can no longer neglect environmental issues, and Pyongyang has invited foreign experts to learn from them.


On the North Korean side, 130 officials and scholars, including 12 environmental experts, will be at the conference.

Some may say it was insensible to hold such an event when the international community imposed sanctions after its fifth nuclear test.
