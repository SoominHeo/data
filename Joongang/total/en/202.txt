Since July 12, candlelight vigils have been continuing from 7 p.m. at the county office parking lot.
At first, 300 locals gathered voluntarily to protest the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile defense system in Seongju.
By July 17, the number of protesters had grown to 1,500.
The Seongju Office of Education estimated that 200 elementary, middle and high school students in the county participated in the protest.

The government is primarily responsible for failing to explain to local residents the possible consequences and issues that the residents are worried about, such as potential health risks, prior to the announcement.
Nevertheless, young students’ participation in the Thaad protests leaves a bitter taste.
Some people are worried that it could unfold like the mad cow disease rallies in 2008 did during the Lee Myung-bak administration.
At this juncture, the Committee Against Thaad Deployment declared that it will stage peaceful demonstrations, asking outsiders to stay away from local protests.
