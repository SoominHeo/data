While they are actually in their 20s, the girls look more like kindergarten students, with their childlike voices and simple tunes.
Male fans are going crazy over Crayon Pop.
They find the childish, cartoonish and totally unsexualized images very cute.
You can easily find many video clips online of enthusiastic fans jumping wildly at concerts or military unit performances.
Some shout the refrain, “Jump!
Jump!” from “Pa Pa Pa.”
Older fans of Crayon Pop refer to themselves as “Uncle Pop.”
Behind the enthusiasm of these male fans may be nostalgia for the cartoons and dances they once enjoyed in their youth.
