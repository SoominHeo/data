All three are aimed at adding fashion to the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, and popularizing domestic brands on a global scale.

Concept Korea has announced a list of designers that will appear in its New York showcase in September.

The globalizing project is also planning a major event in New York on Aug. 5.

The fashion Hallyu projects should be unified into one so they can be operated more effectively and efficiently.

Berlin and the Foreign Ministry of Germany are preparing Berlin Fashion Week in a bid to make the city “the fifth-largest fashion center.”
