A sensitive and subtle power dynamic runs between the two.
As such, it seems like Abe went out of his way for Aso 
An important point of attention in Korea-Japan relations after the Japanese upper house election on Sunday is the upcoming Yasukuni Shrine visit around Aug. 15.
We need to watch out for the Abe-Aso duo.
Abe is under pressure from the United States.
Last week, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell and vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Michael Green visited Japan and openly and repeatedly warned key Japanese officials “not to provoke Korea.”
Moreover, Tokyo is working to arrange U.S. President Barack Obama’s state visit to Japan this fall.
A visit to the shrine a month before Obama’s visit could create huge problems.
As a result, Washington is keeping Abe tied up.
So here, the front man is Aso.
Abe may look on as Aso visits Yasukuni and he himself stays away.
This would be a recurrence of what happened in April.


This would be a recurrence of what happened in April.

One positive aspect about the fact that Aso is taking the trips to the shrine is that Aso has been visiting the Yasukuni shrine every year since his first visit on April 28, 1952, when he was in sixth grade.

But no matter what happens, August will be an uncomfortable month as we closely watch the Abe-Aso duo and how they handle the Yasukuni issue.
