Hyundai Motor and the union representing subcontractor workers are negotiating an upgrade to permanent status for 1,750 workers this year, and for 3,500 by 2016.
But the union and the umbrella union group are demanding that the company place all 6,800 part-time workers on the permanent payroll and stop hiring workers on a non-permanent basis.


Over 3,000 activists and members of the militant Federation of Korean Trade Unions arrived at Hyundai Motorâ€™s Ulsan industrial complex last weekend in a convoy of buses and vans.

More than 100 security guards and protestors were hurt in the clash.

One newspaper reported that after the performance, the protestors drank all night, with some even ending up fighting amongst themselves.
