The Erdogan government is determined to purge more than 3,000 followers and sympathizers of the coup after arresting them, as seen in his grim vow to “let them pay the price.”
Even capital punishment, which was abolished long ago, appears to be revived.
Given the crowds’ wrath against the armed soldiers involved in the coup, retribution could get out of control.
Blood begets blood.
Though the coup ignored the constitutional order, the government must not take revenge on the rebels beyond the rule of law.
The international community has pointed out that the insurgents staged the coup in protest of the president’s prolonged seizure of power, suppression of the press and biased appointments in government posts.
Erdogan should not exploit this as an opportunity to remove his political enemies.
Another concern is the safety of Korean residents and tourists there.
Security experts say that various types of terrorist attacks and commotion take place 4.7 times a day in Turkey.
