Among the inmates of the Cheongju Womenâ€™s Correctional Institution, about 30 percent are serving terms for killing their husbands.

Last week, the Suwon District Court handed down a suspended sentence to a woman in her 80s who strangled her husband after living with him for 67 years.

I hope the step will help to end domestic violence in this country once and for all.
