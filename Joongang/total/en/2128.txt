The inhumane treatment and merciless punishment of repatriated defectors is widely known to the world through various testimonials by defectors.
North Korean authorities appeared to offer the nine young defectors special treatment after the international community’s criticisms.

We hope that North Korea sincerely accepts the G-8 leaders’ warning and guarantees the young defectors totally humanitarian treatment.
