At a presentation to the reporters on the potential effects of Thaad earlier this month, a reporter pointed out that the safe range in the U.S. Army manual is different from the data presented by the defense ministry (2015 Guam Environmental Impact Report).
The defense ministry claimed that the U.S. Army manual was not right, only to retract the remark immediately.
Moreover, the military’s position was inconsistent, as it said to maintain strict security until the announcement, while promising to explain the issue to the residents sufficiently before the announcement.
When the residents protested that there had been no prior explanation, the defense ministry made an excuse that the media had revealed it first.
The government had cancelled the announcement only 14 minutes before the schedule, only to reverse it again.


Two months later, then defense minister Kim Tae-young said in private, “People don’t believe the Board of Audit and Inspection’s investigation and the international investigation team.

Six years have passed, and the ministry is fighting another battle.

The government had cancelled the announcement only 14 minutes before the schedule, only to reverse it again.

The defense ministry must face the public with 100 percent truth and facts rather than making up stories here and there.
