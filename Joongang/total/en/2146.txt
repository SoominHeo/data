It took only eight days from start to finish.
As the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland proposed high-level talks last Thursday, the government responded quicker than ever before.
In seven hours after the Northâ€™s proposal, the government counter-proposed to Pyongyang to have a ministerial-level meeting in Seoul on Wednesday.
Next morning, Pyongyang proposed working-level talks to deal with the reopening of the Kaesong Industrial Complex as well as the resumption of tourism to Mount Kumgang and more reunions of families separated by the border.
All went surprisingly smooth and fast.
But the actual atmosphere of the working-level talks was different.
Despite a 17-hour long negotiation, both sides could not reach an agreement on the level of their chief representatives, which led to a disappointing breakdown of the talks.
