2 man of the UFD as vice chairman.
The No.
3 man is the director general, whom North Korea wanted to send to the talks as chief representative of its delegation.
It’s a shameful development for both Seoul and Pyongyang that such long-awaited talks have to be scuttled due to a disagreement over the relative levels of their representatives, when the two sides agreed to meet and certainly have plenty of urgent issues to discuss.
That is tantamount to dashing cold water on the rising expectations of the people, including hundreds of South Korean businessmen who were running their factories in the last symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation in Kaesong.
Of course, it’s too early to jump to any permanent conclusions.
Such hurriedly arranged meetings are inherently susceptible to breakdowns at any time, particularly considering the North’s fondness for belligerent provocations.
But the scheduled meeting was obviously going to deal with such important issues as the reopening of the industrial park in Kaesong and the resumption of tourism to Mount Kumgang, which was suspended after a South Korean tourist was shot to death by a North Korean guard five years ago, along with more reunions of families separated by the border.
