Two years ago, the university team was successful with research using a fresh egg in the United States, but the research did not progress in Korea out of fear of damaging the egg and stoking controversy against human cloning.
The university hopes to use stem cell lines derived from somatic cell cloning embryos to treat patients suffering from optic nerve damage, stroke and osteochondral defects.
This is welcome news for scientists of stem cell research, which had come to a full stop after a celebrated local cloning pioneer, Hwang Woo-suk, was found to have fabricated his stem cell lines and research results in late 2005.


Stem cell research, which has been underwater for the last seven years, has cautiously resurfaced.

The university will be resuming the research after failing in the reproduction stage during the first trial licensed in 2009.
