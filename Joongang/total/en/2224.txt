Market participants are betting the dollar could soar to 110 yen as the current trend continues.
The cheaper yen is a boon to Japan’s manufacturers and exporters and a nightmare to rival Korean companies and our export-reliant economy.
If exports slip further while local demand remains sluggish, the economy won’t be able to pull out of the slowdown in the second half as hoped.
As expected, stocks tumbled, quickly wiping out the gains from the Bank of Korea’s benchmark rate cut last week.
The problem is that the Korean government has few policy options to fight Japan’s aggressive monetary easing.
The Japanese government’s currency policy gained tacit approval from the G-7 group as part of the country’s all-out measures to kick-start and inflate the depressed economy.
