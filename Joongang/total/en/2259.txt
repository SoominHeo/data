The government has been attempting dialogue on the eating and health conditions of around 170 South Korean employees remaining in the complex.
Since Pyongyang closed the gates to the industrial city near the border on April 3, transport of food and necessities has been cut off.
The South Korean workforce was reduced to 170 from 700 and they are now surviving on meager stocks left in the deserted complex.
