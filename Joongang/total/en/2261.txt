Grapes and berries bring three times more income as juice and six times more as alcohol, compared to when theyâ€™re used as fresh fruits.
Kang emphasized that we need to work on developing alcoholic beverages that can represent the country in order to vitalize our local economy and enhance our national image.
He cited the example of Tokachi wine from Ikedamachi, a farming village in Tokachi County in Hokkaido, Japan.
The small village, with a population of 7,000, suffered from an earthquake in 1952 and poor harvests two years in a row.
