While Singapore’s GDP projection is a mere 2.6 percent for this year, it boasts one of the world’s largest per-capita incomes ($51,162), more than double that of South Korea ($23,113).
Once one of the most vibrant economies in Asia, South Korea might soon draw sneers from regional peers.
Ernst &amp; Young, one of the Big Four accounting firms, cut its growth forecast for South Korea to 2.2 percent from 3.3 percent just three months ago.
That is below even the 2.3 percent the government estimated last month in its pitch for a supplemental budget to compensate for an expected shortfall in tax revenue.
