I’ve always wanted to go to the five-day village market.
When I got on the subway, I saw a sign board posted by Yangpyeong County.
The market opens in Yangsu on the 1st and 6th, in Yangpyeong on the 3rd and 8th and in Yongmun on the 5th and 10th.

When I inquired at the Yangpyeong County Office, Kim Seong-ok of the local economy bureau told me that it is a unique market with some 300 street stalls and 30 direct vendors, including farmers doing business within the marketplace.
I could find chain bakeries, pizzerias and chicken shops as well as high-end residential towers near the market.
There was an interesting contrast between city and country, tradition and modernity.
However, the village market offered unbelievably affordable prices and local tastes.
A bowl of red bean porridge and barley rice each cost 3,000 won, buckwheat cake was 2,000 won and sorghum cake was 1,000 won.
It felt as if I were in a time machine.

Since early spring, I’ve been touring the five-day markets in Yangpyeong County on my days off.
