After two powerful explosions near the finish line, at least three people died and about 140 were injured.
As the number of the seriously wounded will surely increase, more people may lose their lives.
The FBI is chasing suspects under the assumption that the explosion is most likely connected to a terrorist plot.
After the terrible scene on the spot was exposed to the public through media coverage, the United States was again struck with horror reminiscent of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks which took the lives of 2,977 innocent citizens.
In the 117th marathon race in Boston, as many as 27,000 runners from 96 countries around the globe participated.
The perpetrator detonated explosive devices about three hours after the winner had passed the finish line - strongly hinting at a possibility of meticulously blowing them up when a number of amateur marathoners approached the finish line with lots of applause from their families and friends.

It could have been committed by a professional terrorist group affiliated with a religion or by a loner with no connection to a specific group, as we clearly witnessed in the bombing against government buildings and a shooting spree on innocent citizens by a psychopath in Norway in July 2011.
