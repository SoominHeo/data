Caernarfon in North Wales is known for Caernarfon Castle, one of the castles that Edward I of England built upon conquering Wales in around 1300.
In 1969, the investiture ceremony for Charles, Prince of Wales was held here.

History is repeating itself 90 years later.
I bring up the history of the British Liberal Party because a Saenuri Party lawmaker lamented, “This is not even a political party.”
This is the truth.
The current party leader’s hunger strike is strange enough, but he then ordered lawmakers to attend a National Assembly session, only to be rebuked a few hours later.
We’ve seen the ruling party embarrassing itself every five years, but it is especially absurd this year.
There is one thing the Saenuri Party must remember.


In 1969, the investiture ceremony for Charles, Prince of Wales was held here.

He represented Caernarfon in Parliament for 55 years.
