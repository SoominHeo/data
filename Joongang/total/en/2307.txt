In February, I went to Cyprus, right before a series of bank closures and the sovereign financial crisis were revealed.

A French immigrant said he would have had to pay 40 percent of his pension income as tax in France, but in Cyprus, he pays 5 percent.

Frankly, I envied Cyprus for a moment, thinking Koreaâ€™s per capita income would be $30,000 to $40,000 if we could attract such foreign capital.

If the crisis had occurred two years later, Korea might have experienced its second IMF bailout.
