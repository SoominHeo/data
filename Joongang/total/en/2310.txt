Dutch multinational financial corporation ING Group came up with the idea when it advanced to the U.S. market in 1997.
How is direct banking different?
“When a salesman cannot explain the product in 20 seconds, don’t sell it.”

Benchmarking the success of ING, HSBC began a direct banking operation in Korea.
In February 2007, then-CEO Simon Cooper introduced “HSBC Direct” and held a press conference at the Hilton Hotel, Seoul.
They pledged to approach the customers directly and offer 1 to 2 percent higher interest rates than other banks.

It may have been an inevitable choice for KDB, which has only 60 branches.
It was a way to prepare a foundation as a commercial bank and enable privatization.
One year and four months later, KDB Direct amassed 9 trillion won ($8.07 billion) in deposits.


“When a salesman cannot explain the product in 20 seconds, don’t sell it.”

The result was a great success, with more than 15 million customers in nine countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

When KDB Financial Group CEO Kang Man-soo introduced “KDB Direct” two years ago, the market had mixed forecasts.

When other banks offered a mid-3 percent interest rate on average, KDB Direct offered 4 percent.
