The project was ambitiously pushed ahead six years ago based on greedy and vague fantasies about renovating the banks of the Han River and raking in the real estate gains.
The chances of resuscitating this elephantine project now appear slim.
High rises along the skylines of both the Han River and Incheon are largely empty due to the real estate slump.
It would be wiser for authorities and concerned parties to sit down and coolly discuss how best to exit this money-losing project without further damage.
Accountability may eventually end up being decided on by the court.
But state-funded Korail could go bankrupt if it loses its investment in the bid to transform its former train storage lot into a multifunctional business district of shopping malls, hotels and apartment complexes.
There needs to be a re-examination of whether the project should be entirely scrapped or scaled down for incremental development of businesses that can be saved.
But the development should not be bailed out with public funds or involvement from public entities, as some recommend.
It could set a very negative and wasteful precedent because other money-losing real estate development projects led by local governments and private companies could also demand similar bailouts.
Asset-backed commercial papers and construction project loans that mature by the end of this year total 27 trillion won.
