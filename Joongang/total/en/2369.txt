Coming into an unexpected $20,000 dollars apparently boosts your happiness as much as getting married.
If you lose $180,000 dollars, the level of misery is said to be similar to that of losing a child.

During the period, income levels exploded in Korea, which is among the top 5 nations with the most dramatic jump in happiness.
But as income goes up, the effect on happiness becomes smaller.

You’re happy when you get richer than other people.
But you feel less happy if you find others are growing richer than you.
Eduardo Porter wrote in “The Price of Everything” that when economic growth results in some people getting more, the happiness of the rest goes down as much as it goes up for the bigger gainers.
He calls happiness a zero-sum game.
President Park Geun-hye has promised an era of happiness.
Her definition of it is a variation on her father’s “Let’s get rich” slogan.
She pledges to boost economic growth and make the country richer so that everyone gets happier.
But in a country with a per-capita income of $20,000, economic growth is not enough.
She needs to think further.
She wants to begin the era of happiness, but her cabinet likely won’t be formed for over a month.


If you lose $180,000 dollars, the level of misery is said to be similar to that of losing a child.

According to the research of economist Richard Easterlin, the happiness index went up in 45 of 52 countries whose income increased over 25 years since the 1950s.

During the period, income levels exploded in Korea, which is among the top 5 nations with the most dramatic jump in happiness.

If you make more than $75,000 a year, increases in income have little impact on happiness.
