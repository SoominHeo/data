Some said the crash could delay full introduction of autonomous cars by at least five years.

Last year, Ford recalled 37,000 F-150 pick-up trucks from the U.S. market because the brakes were automatically applied even when nothing was ahead of the truck.

After the crash was reported, Teslaâ€™s stock price fell by 3 percent to $206.25, but it  bounced back to $216.50 on July 1.
