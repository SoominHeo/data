Since it is my job as a journalist to investigate, I didnâ€™t hesitate to drive two hours to see the roses in person.

After breeding repeatedly on average for eight years, he gets a new rose.

In an effort to recover sovereignty of breeds, our researchers across the country began to nurture new breeds one after another.

But even if my rosy dream had turned into something like a thorny cactus, I may soon be able to transform it into a new beautiful rose eight years later - if I breed it with a new rosy dream now.
