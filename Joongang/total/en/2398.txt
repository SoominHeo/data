Local companies said they will be outpaced by Chinese rivals in shipbuilding (41.1 percent), telecommunications (38.1 percent), textiles (31.1 percent), steel (29.1 percent) and automobile manufacturing (28.5 percent) within five years.
Chinese companies that had been winning in labor-intensive sectors are moving up fast and threatening our biggest exports like shipbuilding, information technology, steel and automobiles.
The companies have reason to worry.
The Samsung Economic Research Institute estimates that China is already a formidable rival to South Korea in the parts, material, equipment and mobile industries.
Koreaâ€™s manufacturing sector is now sandwiched between Japan and China, losing ground in both quality and price competitiveness.
Low-cost China is quickly advancing in technology, and advanced Japanese products are growing cheaper thanks to the weak yen.
Most Korean companies - 79.8 percent - believe the manufacturing sector will be squeezed by Chinese and Japanese competitors perhaps to the point of losing the game.
