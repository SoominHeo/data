It is shocking that four members of the liberal Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union were prosecuted for propagating the juche (self-reliance) ideology of North Korea.
They turned out to have devotedly injected the failed ideology of the North into the minds of young students under the guise of educators.
The government cannot avoid criticism for leaving the situation unattended even when a pro-Pyongyang group took students hostage to foster a communist revolution.
We are dumbfounded by the teachersâ€™ critical violation of our educational values.
The prosecution first cracked down on a pro-North group set up by members of the leftist teachers union.
The four arrested teachers include a former senior deputy chairman of the Ktewu (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union)- a core member who substantially leads the union under the chairman.
