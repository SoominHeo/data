While all four are ultra-rightist regardless of their age, they are superstars in Japanese politics.
In contrast, Japan’s Democratic Party is relatively progressive but struggles to get media exposure.
But it can’t blame the country’s winner-takes-all culture and lopsided media entirely.
Secretary General Goshi Hosono and Seiji Maehara are reluctant to take the helm of the DP after its loss in the general election.
In the end, Banri Kaieada, a characterless politician who lost his own seat, became the party president.
No matter how great and ethical their policy direction may be, the Democratic Party can’t compete with stars who can attract the ears and eyes of the citizens.
Korea’s opposition party can sympathize with Japan’s DP, having lost two consecutive presidential elections with no clear way forward in sight.
