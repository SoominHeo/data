Only five days are left until President-elect Park Geun-hye is sworn in as president.
Regrettably, however, we can hardly expect a smooth transition of power at the current pace.
Despite a mounting nuclear threat from North Korea and some tough economic challenges at home and abroad, Park’s plan to reshape the government to increase the effectiveness of governance for the next five years has hit a wall due to disagreements with the reorganization by the opposition.
The political standoff is exacerbated by delayed confirmation hearings for Park’s nominees to her cabinet.
If some of her appointments happen to fail to make it through the legislative scrutiny, we may have to wait for more than a month until she presides over her first full cabinet meeting, which is reminiscent of the fate of the Lee Myung-bak administration.
