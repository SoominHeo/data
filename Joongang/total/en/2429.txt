Despite the international community’s repeated warnings, North Korea conducted a third nuclear test yesterday following 2006 and 2009 in what amounts to a reckless provocation threatening peace in Northeast Asia and the world.

After brazenly defying the UN Security Council Resolution 2087, which warned of “significant action” if the North engages in yet another provocation, Pyongyang cannot avoid the international community’s tougher sanctions.

As the six-party talks have failed, Korea, America and China need to find a breakthrough through cooperation.
