Japan’s stock market went up by 30 percent in the two months since November and the value of the yen dropped 15 percent.
It is the first time in 42 years that the stock prices have risen for 11 consecutive months.
Japanese companies that had set the exchange rate at 78 yen to the dollar now enjoy great profits since a dollar is currently exchanged at 91 to 92 yen.
So everyone cheers for Abe.
The prime minister is very happy with the economic rebound.
However, Western countries are wary and concerned about ruthless Abenomics, twisting the central bank’s arm to release money into the market.
But such voices don’t get much attention among the Japanese.
They claim they did not complain to America and Europe when the yen was high, and they are eager to get out of their 15-year-long deflation.
