Big-box stores, also faced with the worst-ever revenue losses in 20 years, are slashing prices by more than half in a desperate bid to get consumers to open their wallets.
Authorities estimate that private consumption could rise nearly 3 percent later this year.
But even if that does happen, it would mean spending similar to the gain of 2.6 percent in 2009 following the global financial crisis and 2.8 percent in 2003 after the credit card bubble burst.


As a result, however, private consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of the GDP, is also quickly receding, pushing the economy further toward the danger of a recession.

Despite the New Year sales period, department store revenue fell 8 to 10 percent from a year ago.
