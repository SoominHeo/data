“Cheongdam-dong daughters-in-law” are women who marry rich and flaunt the handbags that ladies of lower incomes drool over and request as wedding gifts.
Thanks to the immense demand, luxury brands constantly ratchet up the price of such bags into the multimillion won range despite the falling won-euro exchange rate.
But as soon as a bag becomes popular for ladies of other, less celebrated neighborhoods, Cheongdam-dong’s divas have already moved on.
In the TV show, Alice buys an expensive bag with a credit card as she falls deeper into the Cheongdam-dong fantasy.
