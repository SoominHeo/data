The success is particularly meaningful as it was achieved after failures in 2009 and 2010 and after suffering two postponements due to technical problems.
The two failures were part of the cost of space exploration and the price a country pays to reach a stepping stone to advance its space technology.
The success is a tremendous accomplishment for our science and technology community given the critical lack of technology, budget and manpower compared to other space powers.
We extend our sincere congratulations to the scientists at the Naro Space Center and elsewhere who devoted themselves to realizing the nationâ€™s dream of making it to space.
The successful launch carries great significance as it shows how we put together the technologies and experiences required to achieve independent space technology.
Now, we should make more efforts to facilitate technological advancements.
Space technologies that involve materials engineering, combustion engineering and control engineering have a huge ripple effect on other industries.
Those technologies are essential to reinforcing our self-reliance in defense as well.
The most urgent task for us is developing our own first-stage rocket instead of relying on foreign technology as we did with the Russian-made first-stage rocket used in the launch yesterday.
