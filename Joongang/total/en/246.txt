Employees of the two state-owned banks will be rewarded with sizable bonuses this year as well.
Because the review is of last year’s performance, former chief executive Hong Ky-tack is get a bonus as will his staff and executives.
The review board said the score is not just based on the banks’ management of corporate restructuring, but also on their so-called “contribution to creating new jobs and industries for the creative economy.”
The two banks require recapitalization capital of up to 11 trillion won of taxpayers’ money due to their exposure to soured debts of the troubled companies they were managing.


Troubles at shipyards and shippers have been warned about since 2008.

Yet the bank earned top grades and gave staff fat bonuses over the last seven years.
