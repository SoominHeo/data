Lawmaker Chung Doo-un wrote “Best Prime Ministers, Worst Prime Ministers” after he lost the 2000 general election, and after serving three terms he was recently put under court custody for a violation of political fund regulations.


The ruling Saenuri Party’s Chung Doo-un classified the prime ministers of Korea according to Hammerstein’s methodology as he spent 15 years of his 20-year career in public service at the Office of the Prime Minister.
