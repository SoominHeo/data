The value of the Japanese yen has fallen over 15 percent in just four months, sinking below the 90-mark against the U.S. dollar amid calls from new Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to cure Japan’s maladies through ultra-loose monetary and fiscal policies.
He has even vowed to make the Bank of Japan conform to his will to fix the deflationary and sluggish economic trend through “unlimited money-printing” - or quantitative easing to depreciate the yen, ignite inflation and revive Japan as an export powerhouse.
His new cabinet approved an emergency stimulus package to increase government spending and projects and set a specific inflation target of 2 percent to “free” the economy from its chains of deflation and a strong yen.

The yen has remained strong since 2008 despite it having under-performed, largely due to external factors.
