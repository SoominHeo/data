Given that the number of single elderly is estimated to total about 1.19 million, it means just one out of 10 senior citizens living alone receives government care, including phone calls from social workers.
The elderly poor may be better off than the rest of their age group living alone because at least theyâ€™re checked upon every day.
Preventing solitary deaths is no easy task.
Japan, which has had a similar problem for a few years, estimates that about 26,000 people died alone and without decent care and assistance in 2011.


The bones of a man in Busan were found six months after he died in total solitude.

About 170,000 are on the watch list.
