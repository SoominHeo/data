President Lee Myung-bak’s signature project to restore and revamp the country’s four major rivers has proved to be a colossal failure in terms of safety and water standards, according to a Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) finding.

The government watchdog pointed to the shoddy design of irrigation waterways at a number of reservoirs around the four rivers, which have caused land erosion.

Meanwhile, the environment ministry said the initial testing of the water in the four rivers was aimed at measuring the BOD of biodegradable pollutants, adding that it plans to come up with comprehensive measures to improve the water quality after a long-term evaluation.

While agreeing on the necessity of the project, we have advised the government to pursue it in incremental stages rather than all at once.
