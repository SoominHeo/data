Some cheerfully dream about a second career, while others struggle to get used to retired life.
“What should I do?” I asked my wife, who seemed to already have an answer prepared.
“You have to do something, no matter what,” she said, adding that staying active will help keep me healthy.

These days, the only leisurely retirement to be found in Korea is on soap operas.
Most retirees have to work into old age as they don’t have enough savings.
The sad truth for Korea’s senior citizens is that they can’t expect a comfortable old age; as long as they’re alive, they have to work.
According to a recent report published by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, 41 percent of our senior citizens between the ages of 65 and 69 were employed in 2011, more than twice the OECD average of 18.5 percent.
