President-elect Park Geun-hyeâ€™s transition committee is mulling draining 30 percent of funding for basic monthly benefits to senior citizens out of the national pension.

The government revised the related law in 2000 to sustain the public servant pension.

Despite the reform in 2009, the public servant pension still offers greater returns at an earlier receiving age than the national pension.

At the current rate, the national pension will run into a deficit after 30 years and run out of funds 40 years later.
