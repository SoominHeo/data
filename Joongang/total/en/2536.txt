President-elect Park Geun-hye is reportedly mulling whether to send special envoys to four major countries - the United States, China, Russia, and Japan - as her predecessors have done.
However, this hardly seems prudent as Korea is no longer restricted in its foreign affairs to the four major powers.

But we are long past needing to kowtow or rely primarily on the four nations to promote our national interests.
In terms of political and economical weight, the European Union, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, Africa and Latin America have all become much more important to Korea than in former days.


However, this hardly seems prudent as Korea is no longer restricted in its foreign affairs to the four major powers.

Roh said he needed to define his view of South Korea’s role as a “balancing power in Northeast Asia” and his plans to reorganize diplomatic relations with the four world powers.

Given the roles the four major countries play in respect to Korean diplomacy, the country cannot help but focus on them.

But we are long past needing to kowtow or rely primarily on the four nations to promote our national interests.

It would bode badly for the country’s image to send envoys to the four countries alone.

But making such an overture in favor of the four powers could do more harm than good, especially in lieu of any substantial benefits.

It is time for president-elects to reconsider the tradition of sending envoys to the four nations.
