When I read the Bible in college, I found a phrase I now live by: “As a dug returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly (Proverb 26:11).”

Smoking is one of the habits I am struggling to kick.

I had stopped smoking for as long as three months, but my willpower was no stronger than the tiger in the founding myth who failed to stay in the cave for 100 days.

When you place food at the end of the maze and have a mouse search for it, the brain becomes very active at first.
