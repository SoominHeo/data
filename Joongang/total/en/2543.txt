I have learned one thing from this election.
The 5060 generation is not a minority.


The 5060 generation is not a minority.

But one thing in particular is strange: the population of the 5060 generation is the largest.

So why is the 5060 generation forgotten?

I am so excited that the 5060 generation gets to enjoy our own kind of entertainment.

The 5060 generation has more time and money for culture and leisure than the young people who have to be at work.
