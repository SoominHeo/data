The newly opened National Museum of Korean Contemporary History has a great significance because it is a museum featuring Korea’s history since the independence movement from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule.

Among the exhibited items are the handwritten documents of the late national independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun, March 1 Declaration of Independence, the Constitution bill, a university student’s diary recording the April 19 Revolution, major documents from the Park Chung Hee administration’s five-year economic development plan, a diary and passport of a Korean miner dispatched to Germany in the 1960s, and a Pony, Korea’s first exported car.
