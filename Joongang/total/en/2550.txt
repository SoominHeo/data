Only 37.4 percent, or 2.61 million voters, supported opposition party candidate Moon Jae-in.
The exit polls indicated that ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye earned 62.5 percent, or 4.37 million votes, from the age group.

That means the voters with liberal tendencies voted for progressive candidates both elections.
However, the support for the conservative candidate increased by 1.51 million over the last 10 years.
The numbers tell us that the progressive faction has not collapsed but has certainly failed to expand its territory.


The exit polls indicated that ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye earned 62.5 percent, or 4.37 million votes, from the age group.

We all admit that the concentrated support of the voters in their 50s led to Parkâ€™s victory.

However, the support for the conservative candidate increased by 1.51 million over the last 10 years.

The liberals may feel frustrated and disappointed, but the seed of hope remains in the 14.69 million votes they earned.
