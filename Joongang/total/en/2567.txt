The conservative Liberal Democratic Party of Japan made a strong comeback in Sunday’s parliamentary election by securing 294 seats, more than  half of the 480 in the House of Representatives.

We cannot but worry about the course of Japan under the leadership of nationalist Shinzo Abe, the head of the LDP who will return as prime minister for the second time.

The LDP’s public support rate is no more than 20 percent.
