The UN Security Council has denounced Pyongyang’s rocket launches and forbidden additional tests through the UN Resolutions 1718 and 1874.
When the North dared to launch an intercontinental missile in April, the council declared it will “automatically” call a Security Council meeting if the North test-fires a missile.
