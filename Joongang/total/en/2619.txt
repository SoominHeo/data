A fourth South Korean was reported to have been physically assaulted in Australia this year at the hands of youths who may have been motivated by racism.
Cho, 28, who had been on a working holiday in Brisbane since July, was attacked 
All four assaults were violent, including one case where part of the victim’s finger was chopped off without any reasonable cause, and all four were committed by local white youths.
Other Asians from Japan and China have also been targeted, raising concerns about a re-emergence of racist hate crimes in the country.
Despite the ongoing concerns, local police were slack in their investigation and reportedly made racist comments - like “Asians are so stupid and silly” - in front of the Korean victim who was reporting the crime.
It does not look well for the country if Australian authorities appear to be unconcerned about racist attacks against Asian students and workers.
Last month, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard outlined the country’s goals for the next 13 years that were primarily focused on closer ties with Asia.
They included actions like introducing more scholarships for Asian students and making it compulsory to learn at least one Asian language at school.
However, her plans will be of little use if the Australian government cannot protect Asians from criminal attacks on its own soil.
Australia suffered a diplomatic spat with India in 2009 amid a drastic rise in racially motivated assaults against Indians, including murders that sparked massive protests by Indians against abusive overtones and discriminations.
