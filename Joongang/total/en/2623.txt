She is the younger sister of Kim Jong-un, first chairman of North Korea’s National Defense Commission, and there seems to be no one who can stop her.
Five months ago, when her brother Jong-un attended the opening ceremony of the Nungra Peoples’ Amusement Park, she jumped around from behind the North Korean leader and senior officials of the Workers’ Party and military.

Although he assured the people in his first public speech in April that they won’t have to tighten their belts anymore, the promise is expected to become empty words.
During her childhood, Yo-jong studied with her brothers Jong-chol and Jong-un at the International School of Berne in Switzerland.
She was exposed to Western culture and has some knowledge of international affairs and the problems of the North Korean regime.
Therefore, the world wonders what role she will play in the future.
She must not just become a beneficiary of the third-generation power succession.
If so, she will be nothing more than a “military first” princess trapped in the framework of juche (self-reliance) ideology and “military-first” policy.

The free-spirited Kim Yo-jong was heralded during the memorial ceremony for the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il last December.
