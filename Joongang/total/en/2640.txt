According to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the number reached 9.46 million last year.
But at its current pace, it looks set to hit eight figures this month and possibly climb to 12 million by the end of the year.
Non-Korean tourists have surged tenfold since their number first passed the one-million threshold in 1978 and more than doubled since reaching 5 million in 2000.
The increase suggests the countryâ€™s tourism industry has grown quickly over the last decade.
The upward trajectory owes largely to the popularity of Korean pop culture and entertainers and a rise in Chinese tourists.
Despite the growth in numbers, however, tourism revenue remains short of expectations.
The number of foreign tourists surged 64 percent between 2005 and 2011, but their spending here grew just 4.4 percent on average annually.
