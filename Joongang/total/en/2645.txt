With the ruling Saenuri Party’s presidential candidate Park Geun-hye’s announcement of her economic platforms last Friday, voters now can see the three candidates’ positions on the thorny issue of “economic democratization.”

Despite some differences in their approaches to unfair chaebol business practices, the three candidates have mostly touted similar planks on the issue of economic justice as seen by their commitments to introduce a punitive compensation system for subcontractors, a scrapping of the Fair Trade Commission’s exclusive rights to accuse chaebol’ malpractices and a reinforcement of punishment for business crimes of big business groups, to name a few.

The three candidates’ pledges to ban new cross-shareholdings or limit chaebol from entering a particular market, for example, can help foreign capital to take over our domestic market rather than foster small businesses.
