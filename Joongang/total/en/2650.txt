The globalization of seafood reminds me of my business trip to Cuba in 2005.
I was covering the opening of the Kotra trade center in Havana and heard about a Korean businessman working in the fisheries industry.
When Mr. Choi, who lived in Venezuela, visited Cuba in 1990, he learned a curious fact.
