With this reality in mind, the two candidates should take into account important points when negotiating the merger.
The two should move beyond rhetoric like “a joint declaration on new politics” and be more specific in outlining their vision and direction.

Ahn has been largely characterized as a liberal on the economy and a conservative on security issues and successfully earned the support of many centrists.
Moon, however, has been outspokenly more liberal than President Roh Moo-hyun, under whom he served as chief of staff.
He opposed the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement that Roh initiated and sounded more left-leaning in his comments on the Northern Limit Line, the western maritime border with North Korea.
Both must clearly unite their voices on issues involving the United States and North Korea as they can affect the country’s security.
They also must explain what issues they differ on and how and why they have come to an agreement.
Lastly, they must finalize merger talks as soon as possible to give the public enough time to compare and contrast the policies of the two main candidates.

The two should move beyond rhetoric like “a joint declaration on new politics” and be more specific in outlining their vision and direction.

The two camps should discuss coordinating their policies to present a congruous and clear direction.
