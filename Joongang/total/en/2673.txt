The three presidential candidates have declared their plans to overhaul politics.
Their plans largely coincide, indicating political reform is likely regardless of who gets elected.

Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri Party wants more civilian participation in the selection of candidates for both the ruling and opposition parties.
Moon Jae-in of the opposition Democratic United Party and independent Ahn Cheol-soo believe nominees should be elected entirely through open primaries.

The three candidates have agreed to scrap party nominations for councilmen of local government assemblies, who act like subordinates to lawmakers of the National Assembly, because the latter wield so much influence in nominations.
