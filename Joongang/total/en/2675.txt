The Supreme Court has upheld lower court rulings that didnâ€™t take into account unstable mental and physical conditions in two cases of sexual offenses committed under the influence of alcohol.

Based on Article 2 of Clause 10 of the Criminal Law, our courts have customarily handed down lighter punishments for alcohol-induced sexual assaults against adults.

According to statistics from the National Police Agency, about 40 percent of all violent crimes in the past five years were committed by drinkers.
