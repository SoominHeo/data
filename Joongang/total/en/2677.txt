The musician was Mexican-American Sixto Rodriguez, who has released two albums, including “Cold Fact” in 1970.
His poetic lyrics and soulful melodies were about the grim reality of life in  Detroit.
“?’Cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmas/ And I talked to Jesus at the sewer/ And the Pope said it was none of his God-damned business/ While the rain drank champagne,” he sang in the song.

He shared all the profits with needy neighbors and still lives as a poor laborer in his home in Detroit.
One of his laborer friends said he does not know Rodriguez’s music well, but he is sure he is a wise man.
“Searching for Sugar Man” shows reality is more dramatic than any fictional dramas.
It documents the miracles music can create through the path of one man.
And yet, there are only eight cinemas in Seoul where this miracle is shared, screened alternately with other shows.

“?’Cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmas/ And I talked to Jesus at the sewer/ And the Pope said it was none of his God-damned business/ While the rain drank champagne,” he sang in the song.

In the 1970s, Rodriguez’s music made it to South Africa, a country of extreme racial discrimination and authoritarian control.

In 1998, Rodriguez, then 56, stood on a stage in South Africa, overwhelmed with emotion as tens of thousands of people sang his song and chanted his name.

The film went on to win awards at other festivals and eventually made its way to Korea, where it was seen by more than 10,000 people.

Since then, Rodriguez has had about 40 concerts in South Africa.
