Removing these dams would kill the four-river restoration project and bring with it heavy costs.
The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, had to retract his proposal to remove the levees along the Han River after the idea sparked heavy criticism during the campaign in October.


Ahn, a candidate without political experience, said he would consider removing the dams around the four major rivers.

The 16 dams are critical for securing a sufficient water reservoir and preventing flooding.
