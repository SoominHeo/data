According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease will increase to 800,000 in 2020 from this year’s estimate of 534,000 and reach one million by 2025.
The major problem is that care for these patients is still primarily taken on by the families.
Insurance coverage for long-time nursing homes and institutional care since 2008 helped ease the burden, but there are more than 400,000 who haven’t received the benefits because their symptoms are deemed too minor or have not been registered properly.
