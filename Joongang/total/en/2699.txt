The same narrative unfolded in 1997, when Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil consolidated about 40 days before the election, and in 2002, when Roh Moo-hyun and Chung Mong-joon did so 20 days before the election.
Some pundits expect it to occur even after the Nov. 25-26 deadline for the official registration of presidential candidates.
However, the candidate unification card causes many unwanted side effects.
After Moon and Ahn decide to consolidate their candidacies, their commitments must change accordingly.
The two candidates still confront each other over political reform, with Moon strongly opposing Ahn’s ideas, including a radical slashing of the president’s appointment rights, the number of legislators, government subsidies for presidential contestants and the role of a central party in the political establishment.

While the U.S. election is focused on such issues as jobs, growth and welfare, Korea’s is overshadowed by the question of whether, when and how the two candidates would merge their candidacies.

In the meantime, the ruling Saenuri Party’s candidate, Park Geun-hye, opposes a three-way TV debate, citing that her rival camps have yet to begin the final race.
