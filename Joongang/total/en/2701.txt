Personally, I will remember Ambassador Muto for two reasons.
He was fluent in Korean and he underwent a lot of trouble during his tenure.
He mastered the language as he worked with Korea for nearly 40 years.

Joseon Tongsinsa was a massive goodwill mission to Japan, whose members included scholars, warriors and artists, which continued for more than 200 years from 1607 1811.
Just like the Baltic Way, which is added to the Unesco Memory of the World Register, the passage from Hanyang (old name of Seoul) to Edo (old name of Tokyo) may be designated.


He mastered the language as he worked with Korea for nearly 40 years.

But Muto unexpectedly came home around 9 p.m. because Pyongyang had announced the death of Kim Jong-il.

I see hope in the International Symposium for the Designation of Joseon Tongsinsa as a Unesco World Heritage held in Busan on Oct. 19.
