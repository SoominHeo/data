I stayed overnight and watched the entire first season of the U.S. television series “Newsroom.”
The HBO series was created by Aaron Sorkin of “West Wing” fame.
It has been praised for dramatic and realistic depictions of the discords between the news production staff and management over the role and limits of the media.
In the show, McAvoy said the United States used to be a great country because journalists were respected by citizens and voters were provided with accurate, objective information about political candidates and their positions.
But that is no longer the case, he said.
Each media company selectively chooses information it likes and distorts it as needed, and American society is the most divided it has been since the Civil War.
McAvoy believes a “well-informed electorate” is the most important element in democracy and attempts a “news revolution” with his colleagues in the newsroom.
With the U.S. presidential election in two weeks, incumbent Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are running neck and neck.

“The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one,” McAvoy said in the show.
