It’s already been two and half years since I moved to Unjeong New Town in Paju, Gyeonggi.

In August 2009, all turnstiles were removed from 17 stations around the country where KTX trains stop, including Seoul Station.

In fact, the free rides are drastically decreasing from 88,921 cases in 2009 to 67,169 in 2010 to 46,080 cases last year.

In August, Korail launched the “Transfer Helpers” program, hiring helpers, including nine homeless people at Seoul Station.
