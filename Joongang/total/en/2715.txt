Korea beat Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Mexico and Namibia in a bid to secure the fund’s headquarters, and the country’s success should be celebrated in the same vein as its hosting of the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and Group of 20 summit.

This comes as welcome news and another cause for celebration after Korea recently won a two-year term on the UN Security Council.

Some 32 international bodies have offices in Korea, but none of them is as important as the GCF.
