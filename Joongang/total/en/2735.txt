The Jeongsu Scholarship Foundation is reportedly attempting to find ways to invest in welfare programs for Busan and the South Gyeongsang region by, for instance, selling its 100-percent stake in the Busan Ilbo and 30-percent stake in MBC.

But a donation plan, no matter what intention it has, is not desirable with only 60 days left until the election.

President Lee Myung-bakâ€™s announcement to donate his wealth for a scholarship - called the Cheonggye Foundation - was welcomed, but its purity was damaged because of the timing: he did it shortly before the 2007 presidential election.
