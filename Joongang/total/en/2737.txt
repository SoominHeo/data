But the candidate that the same fortune-teller picked as the winner of the 2007 presidential election was defeated, so it is unknown whether his prediction would actually help the current candidate’s campaign.
But there has been a case before of a misinterpretation of physiognomy and erroneous fortune-telling ruining the country.
In 1590, right before Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s invasion of Korea, Hwang Yun-gil and Kim Seong-il were sent to Japan as part of the Joseon Tongsinsa goodwill mission.

Niyama Daiho was the most famous fortune-teller of the time, and regarding Seo Yu-dae, a military officer of Joseon, he said, “Seo will certainly rise to a high rank, will bring about a disaster and will then die early.”
Upon returning to Korea, Seo Yu-dae became a general, but he was a generous and respected man who enjoyed longevity, passing away at the age of 70.
Niyama Daiho was wrong about his prediction.


In 1590, right before Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s invasion of Korea, Hwang Yun-gil and Kim Seong-il were sent to Japan as part of the Joseon Tongsinsa goodwill mission.

In 1763, 173 years after Kim Seong-il’s visit, another group of Joseon Tongsinsa delegates went to Japan, and a record of Japanese fortune-tellers’ physiognomy analysis remains today.

Upon returning to Korea, Seo Yu-dae became a general, but he was a generous and respected man who enjoyed longevity, passing away at the age of 70.

The fortune-tellers say the three presidential candidates generally have good physiognomic features.
