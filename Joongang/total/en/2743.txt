Lately, Japanese doctor Yoshinori Nagumo’s book has created a stir by claiming that having one meal a day is the secret of a long and healthy life.

“It is an old concept to think you need to have three regular and balanced meals to live healthier and longer,” he says.

When you hear your stomach growling once, you are burning visceral fat.

When you hear it three times, your blood vessels get younger.

It is great news that having one meal a day guarantees health, youth and longevity.

I made an ambitious suggestion to my wife: “I am considering changing my diet and having one meal a day.”

“I will prepare three meals a day for you, so why don’t you quit drinking and smoking first?” I could not argue with her.
