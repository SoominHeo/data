A group of nearly 1,300 Japanese intellectuals, including Nobel Prize laureate Kenzaburo Oe, sponsored a statement calling for an end to the hysterical reactions and emotive spat over territorial claims brewing among Korea, China and Japan.

Their statement drew attention to a manifesto drawn up by Korean and Japanese intellectuals in 2010 declaring Japan’s forced annexation of the Korean Peninsula in 1910 as illegal.

There are far more issues at stake beyond territorial disputes involving the three nations, however, and losing one’s head due to nationalistic sentiment is akin to “getting drunk on cheap sake,” famous writer Haruki Murakami wrote in Japan’s Asahi Shimbun on Friday.

If the three countries, all of which await key power shifts later this year, do not step back from the brink, we could see hostilities escalate far beyond the exchange of water canon bursts between Japanese and Taiwanese Coast Guard vessels Top executives as well as government officials and politicians from the three countries should first tone down their rhetoric.
