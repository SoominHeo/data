Since acquiring grounds for democracy through constitutional reform in 1987, the country has made great strides in democratization and industrialization.

The three main contestants - Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri Party, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party and Ahn Cheol-soo, independent candidate - all vowed to end the age of hostility and pave the way for the new age of tolerance and unity.

The candidates all relatively lack political experience, but all three are credited for integrity, sincerity and honesty.

Park Geun-hye endured a heavy attack and finally modified her understanding and assessment on past deeds of her father President Park Chung Hee, a strongman who ruled the country for 18 years.
