The North has not only deployed as many as 1,000 Scud missiles aimed at the entire region of South Korea, but is also enthusiastically developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could reach the continental U.S.
The missile gap between Seoul and Pyongyang is too wide to be narrowed at the current pace.
Thatâ€™s why South Korea has earnestly been negotiating with the United States since early last year primarily out of a desperate sense of crisis under ever-growing missile threats from the North.
The 800-kilometer missile range which South Korea and the U.S. have agreed upon appears to be a realistic choice, as it can cover the entire area of North Korea but stops short of arousing Japan.

Missile experts contend it would be difficult to expect an effective strike of strategic targets in the North if our ballistic missiles carry warheads weighing less than 500 kilograms.
A clause in the missile agreement is also problematic as it still bans our development of solid fuel for civilian space rockets.


The 800-kilometer missile range which South Korea and the U.S. have agreed upon appears to be a realistic choice, as it can cover the entire area of North Korea but stops short of arousing Japan.

However, maintaining the warhead weight at the same level as before is troublesome because of the need to sustain our defense for at least one hour until the U.S. nuclear umbrella and troop reinforcements prove effective.
