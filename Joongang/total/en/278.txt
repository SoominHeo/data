When a foreigner buys a real estate using a local as a proxy, it is subject to 25 percent fine.
Hong Kong and Singapore experienced the same trouble because of China, which is why they now impose additional 15 percent acquisition tax on real estate transaction of foreign buyers.


It is learned that there are more than 10 Chinese people living in the apartment.

In the report on foreign buyersâ€™ land acquisition in Seoul published last year, Chinese people showed highest rate of growth, purchasing 56 percent more than the previous year.
