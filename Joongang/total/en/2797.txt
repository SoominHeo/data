So more and more city folks are packing up and moving in search of a second career in the countryside.
Their choice is notable since they are not relocating as a temporary solution to go through the economic crisis; they are moving to rural villages to change their lives.
The rural lifestyle is emerging as an alternative for young Spaniards.
The reverse migration from city to country has been dubbed “Rurbanismo.”
Some sociologists point out that the movement was not inspired by the economic crisis, though Spain’s crippled economy has certainly accelerated the trend.
Instead, it began because the development of Internet made it possible to work from anywhere.
It may be as natural a phenomenon as industrialization spurring people to move to cities, that the people are returning to the country in post-industrial society.
Koreans also are increasingly moving back to the countryside, although we have different motivations.
According to the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the number of households moving from cities to rural areas has been growing over the past decade.
In 2001, 880 households migrated to the country, 1,240 households in 2005 and 4,067 households in 2010.

More than half of the reverse-migrants are of age 50 and older, a sign that as baby boomers retire, many of them choose to spend their twilight years in rural villages.

Those who know from experience say country living is not as easy as one may think.
