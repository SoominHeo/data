The National Assembly on Sept. 3 passed a bill to name a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation into the purchase of a plot of land in a posh southern Seoul neighborhood by the president’s son and the presidential security service to build a retirement home for Lee, a plan that was scrapped after it raised political and social controversy.
The president must sign or veto the bill within 15 days after the legislation is introduced.
We advise against the president’s use of his veto power.
The justice minister and some in the presidential office have been recommending Lee resist the motion.
They claim the bill, which requires the president to choose one of two candidates to head the special investigation recommended by the main opposition Democratic United Party, raises questions of fairness.

In January 2008, Lee filed a suit with the Constitutional Court claiming the law delving into allegations of his involvement with a dubious company called BBK was unconstitutional because the law gave authority to the Supreme Court chief justice to name a special prosecutor to probe the case.
