It has reached a peak in its 100-year history.
Kim’s personal history combined with his uncompromising pursuit of his goals both add drama to his feat in Venice.
The 51-year-old’s schooling ended in middle school due to poverty.
His teenage days were instead spent on factory assembly lines crammed in industrial slums.
After military service, he landed in Paris and made a living by sketching portraits.
After he mastered drawing, he discovered films in his 30s.
He likes to describe himself as “a monster that fed and grew on an inferiority complex.”
He writes, directs, produces and finances his films to explore human psychology, cruelties and contradictions and to consider questions and answers about life.
While snubbed as an eccentric outsider by the local industry, Kim’s startling films have been recognized on the international stage and he is regularly invited to awards ceremonies.
He won the best director award in 2004 for “Bin-jip” in Venice, while another film, “Samaritan Girl,” snatched up the same honor in Berlin the same year.


Korean director Kim Ki-duk’s “Pieta,” with its brutal plot of a loan shark who cripples those who can’t pay up and then seeks salvation through a woman claiming to be his mother, scooped up the Golden Lion for best film at the 69th Venice Film Festival over the weekend.
