Even after its half-hearted recall plans were turned down by the Ministry of Environment for three times, the carmaker continues to shrug it off.
That’s a sharp contrast with its prompt actions to recall the same models sold in Europe with a total cost of 16.2 billion euro and offer $10 billion compensation packages to the roughly 600,000 U.S. owners.
Behind Volkswagen’s such dismissive and arrogant approaches are our environment authorities’ tendency to levy weak punishment on illegal activities of foreign companies and our consumers’ laidback attitudes.
As the government’s regulations on recalls only mandate producers submit their recall plans within 45 days after confirmation of defection — with no further instruction afterwards — car manufacturers can protract their cases with no time limits.
The government is only watching the scene with folded arms citing a lack of articles on refunding for intentionally manipulated cars.
Nevertheless, Volkswagen’s car sales increased by a big margin after the car company reinforced its marketing strategies in Korea, which led three models of Volkswagen to be among the top five imported cars here.
