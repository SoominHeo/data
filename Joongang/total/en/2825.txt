Otherwise, more than 9,000 sexual predators are roaming the streets looking for new prey.
According to the National Police Agency, the number of sex crimes involving rape and sexual abuse hit 81,860 during the period of 2007 to 2011, and 9,189 cases were left unresolved.
Moreover, the number of those unresolved cases sharply rose to 3,094 last year from 1,277 in 2007, a more than twofold increase.
That explicitly shows a huge loophole in our law enforcement system.
A bigger problem, however, is that no one knows what the offenders who haven’t been caught are doing on the streets and in alleys across the country.
Given the meager report rate as low as 10 percent, citizens’ anxiety cannot but be exacerbated.
