Article 3 of the current police law says policemen can do so when there is reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is about to commit a crime or is aware of a criminal act that took place or is about to occur.
According to the law, police officers can ask that person to go to the police station but he or she can refuse to answer or comply with the request.
Such discretion is given to strike a balance between the need for protection and to avoid human rights infringement.
Criticisms of the practice were mostly based on an assessment that law enforcement officers resorted to power abuse without solid grounds for suspicion.
A written warning from the human rights commission in September 2010 didnâ€™t find fault with the act of random questioning on its own.
