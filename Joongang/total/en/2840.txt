The issue of freedom of expression has long been a political football in the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration, particularly after the exacerbation of ideological conflict stemming from massive candlelight protests against the government’s decision to resume U.S. beef imports in 2008.

The prosecution at the time accused the production staff of MBC’s “PD Diary” of defamation and in 2009 arrested Park Dae-sung on charges of spreading false rumors about the government’s economic policies under the pseudonym “Minerva” in cyberspace.

It declared Article 1 of the telecommunication law, which served as the foundation for prosecuting Park, and another clause of the public office election law, which restricted online campaigns through Twitter, for instance, as against the Constitution.
