In June, the KFDA announced it will classify ordinary contraception pills as “special drugs that require a doctor’s prescription” and morning-after pills as over-the-counter drugs, reversing its earlier classifications on each.

Women should take them for as long as 21 days in a row to avoid pregnancy.

In the case of morning-after pills, however, the KFDA decided it would be better to give women easier access to the drugs as they are taken within three days of sexual intercourse to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.
