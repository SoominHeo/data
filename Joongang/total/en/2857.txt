Once a week, I attended a church meeting.

I was standing at one corner with a smile, hoping one of them would talk to me, but I was invisible to them.

Any one of us can be an outcast in an unfamiliar setting.

A group of friends would point at one person as an outcast, and the others would exclude and bully that person.
