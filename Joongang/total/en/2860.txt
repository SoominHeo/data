So the first thing I do in the morning is put a filter in the coffee machine, fill it with a spoonful of ground coffee and make a fresh pot.

Reading a newspaper with a good cup of coffee in the morning is one of the pleasures of my life, and I do not want to compromise the moment.

At first I thought it was bitter, but I soon got used to it.

Rhyu is unwilling to give up his choice of coffee, saying, “You live your life only once and wouldn’t it be a little sad if you have to miss out on this small pleasure?” Progressives who reject Americano are not true progressives.
