Last week, the Bayfords won EuroMillions, a nine-country lottery operated by a French company.
Because there had not been a first-prize winner for 14 consecutive games, the prize money soared to 190 million euros ($234 million).
The Bayfords hit the “super jackpot” by getting all seven numbers when their odds of winning were one in 116.53 million.

If any of these numbers win, the winners would give 5 to 10 percent to the “expert” who predicted the number.
