The ruling Saenuri Party approved the return of its seven lawmakers who got elected in the April 13 general election after running independently after being denied of party nominations.
They include former floor leader Yoo Seong-min, now a fourth term lawmaker, and three-term lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun.
The ruling party has been under criticism for doing nothing over the last two months after a crushing defeat in the election, which gave it a derogatory moniker — “A party in a vegetative state.”
