Justices Kim Jong-dae, Min Hyeong-ki, Lee Dong-heub and Mok Young-joon will retire on Sept. 14.
The seat for former Justice Cho Dae-hyun, who retired in July of last year, is also set to be filled.


The seat for former Justice Cho Dae-hyun, who retired in July of last year, is also set to be filled.

Once all seats are filled, the Constitutional Court, which has been running without a justice for more than a year, should normalize all of its functions.

The main opposition Democratic United Party recommended lawyer Cho Yong-hwan to fill Justice Choâ€™s seat, but his nomination was delayed by opposition from the ruling party, and in February, it was formally vetoed.

Of the five vacancies, two successors will be named by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and three nominated by the National Assembly.

Like the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court is dominated by male judges over 50 years of age with degrees from Seoul National University Law School.
