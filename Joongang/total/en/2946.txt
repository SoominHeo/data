After a long, boring flight, I arrived in San Francisco, where my two daughters live.
It was hot and humid in Seoul, but the climate in Northern California was refreshing and balmy.
After having dinner together, I went to the elder daughter’s house.
It had been six months since we met last winter.

Thankfully, it was a dry sauna, so I didn’t have to get sweaty with them.
My daughter was educated at a top university in the United States and is currently a professor.
Her husband works for a computer company.
The couple has no plans to have children.
When I asked why, they argued that having children cost a fortune, and they are not confident that they would be good parents.
But they were already spending good money to send their dogs to pet day care and gym classes.
Aside from the financial burden, they do not want to sacrifice their careers.
“You can take leave and work part time for a few years,” I advised.
But they said they had barely gotten their jobs in the bad economy.
She said that it was her first semester teaching at the university, and she would not have time to take care of a child when she often has to work overnight.
Venerable Hemin posted on his Twitter that working parents would not feel so sorry for their children if they got up at 6 a.m. and played with the children for 45 minutes every day.
 She was always fond of children, and she is avoiding parenthood not just because of the financial burden.


It had been six months since we met last winter.

So I was sitting inside the sauna box with two dogs.
