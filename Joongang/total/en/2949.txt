When I am on the road, I tailgate and yell at other cars, cut in front of them and change two lanes at once.

When you change lanes in the congested road, the one you switched to suddenly slows down, and the one you just left starts to move.

On the first day I drove after being released from the hospital, I firmly made up my mind that I would not change lanes unless necessary.
