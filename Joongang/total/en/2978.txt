Cooking oil begins to boil at over 240 degrees Celsius.
You can touch it nonchalantly and get burned instantly.
 Last week, Korea acted just as mindlessly over a military information protection agreement with Japan.
The government may have thought that it could put its hands into the oil slyly.
But it got third-degree burns.
