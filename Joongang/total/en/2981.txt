In January 2011, a police officer gave a lecture on crime prevention and safety for women at a university in Toronto.
He said, “Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.”
Women quickly denounced the remarks as inappropriately blaming the victim and staged a protest walk dressed as “sluts” in provocative outfits.
Some staged performances by using their bras as jump ropes.
The movement rapidly spread to 30 countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
The first SlutWalk was organized in Korea in July 2011 in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul.
As the term “slut” is so controversial, the events have attracted media attention.
But still, many people do not know about the cause for which the events stand.
Repelled by the provocative title, many people shun the cause.
But let’s look at why these women are staging a protest.
Whenever a sexual assault case arises, the issue of revealing attire on female victims frequently comes up.
It may be instinct for a straight male to feel attracted to a scantily dressed woman, but committing a crime is never acceptable.
A sexual offense is not driven by sexual desire but by an urge to control.
When three medical students at Korea University were convicted of sexual assault of a female classmate, the offenders distributed a survey and claimed that the victim was not well-behaved and so deserved the assault.
