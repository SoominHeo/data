Kim, who owns a Web site design company, started collecting computers as a hobby five years ago.
Since then, he and his friends have collected more than 450 units in 200 different models.

Since then, he and his friends have collected more than 450 units in 200 different models.

They are so rare that there will be no more than 10 units listen on eBay in a year.
