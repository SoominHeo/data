While the family believes that Kenya is a young businessman, he is actually 40 years her senior.
The family works together to make sure the mother does not find out, but one lie leads to another.
The chaotic situation brings about constant laughs, and I was giggling the whole time.
Interestingly, I initially expected the unrealistic couple to break up, but as the story moved on, I ended up rooting for their relationship.
The old boyfriend does his best to get approval from the family of his girlfriend, and his positive attitude won my heart.
The movie “Eungyo” is a tragic tale of a 70-year-old poet and a 17-year-old girl.

I always do my best, and I am more interested in the future than the past.
What would have happened if the old poet in “Eungyo” were a confident, positive and motivated man like Ayumi’s boyfriend?
Instead of being jealous, gloomy and frustrated, he would have made his best efforts to complete his love.
Knowledge and prestige can certainly be sexual charms just like youth and freshness.
He shouldn’t have to be so lonely and secretly admire the young woman.
As long as you’re healthy, you can do anything.
By the way, what would you do when your grown-up daughter brings home a 70-year-old boyfriend?
Would you cheer for their love and bless their future?

Ten years later, I would miss today, but I wouldn’t want to come back here.
