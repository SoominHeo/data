There were more than 8,000 voice phishing cases in Korea last year alone involving as much as 100 billion won in total.
This year, 2,485 cases resulted in 27.4 billion won in damage as of late April.


The Chinese police announced that 235 members — including 51 Koreans — of a voice phishing network were arrested in five provinces of China last week.

The fact that a three-month joint investigation of the voice phishing networks led to a  crackdown on such a large crime ring means that voice phishing has become an even bigger problem than we originally suspected.
