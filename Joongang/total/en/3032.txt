But residents in the area and environmental groups refuse to accept the IAEA’s conclusion, saying it was a predetermined one.
Given that our government was not obligated to ask the agency to conduct a special inspection of the reactor, however, it is difficult to reject the conclusion just because you don’t like it.
The fate of the Gori-1 reactor now depends on a decision by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission on whether to extend the reactor’s lifespan.


The International Atomic Energy Agency gave pretty good marks to the accident-prone Gori-1 nuclear power reactor in Busan.

But residents in the area and environmental groups refuse to accept the IAEA’s conclusion, saying it was a predetermined one.

The fate of the Gori-1 reactor now depends on a decision by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission on whether to extend the reactor’s lifespan.

That situation is expected to continue until 2014, when large-scale thermal power plants are scheduled to be completed.

Even if it decides to extend the lifespan of Gori-1, it only amounts to a technical judgment, not an indulgence.
