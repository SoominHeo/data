The ruling Saenuri Party recently adopted a six-point reform agenda to pursue in the legislature.
They propose that legislators give up immunity from arrest, follow the no-work-no-pay principle, revise their pension system, strengthen penalties on physical violence and enhance the role of ethics committee.
If these proposals are carried out, we may see unprecedented and sweeping changes in the legislature.
Former legislators aged over 65 get monthly pensions of 1.2 million won ($1,025), equivalent to the national pension into which ordinary citizens pay 300,000 won a month for 30 years.
Why should lawmakers enjoy this privilege?
Members of the 19th National Assembly reported personal assets averaging 2.84 billion won, even exempting Representative Chung Mong-joon, who alone is worth more than 2 trillion won.
The figure is more than 10 times the total assets of an average household.
