The Democratic United Party has picked a new leadership with six-term Representative Lee Hae-chan as head of the party and Rep. Park Jie-won as floor leader.
With the election, a tri-polar alliance among Lee, Park and Moon Jae-in, a presidential hopeful of the DUP, may affect the dynamics of the December 19 presidential race.
Before the April 11 general election, the DUP raised strong doubts about its qualification to be a ruling party.


Before the April 11 general election, the DUP raised strong doubts about its qualification to be a ruling party.

After the election, the minor opposition Unified Progressive Party raised an uproar over vote-rigging in one of its primaries and its pro-North Korea stance, which led to a bigger crisis of the DUP after its lawmaker-elect Lim Soo-kyung called North Korean defectors “traitors.”
