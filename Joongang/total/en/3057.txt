Seo Myeong-suk, the director of Jeju Olle, published a book titled “Cruel History of a Female Smoker,” documenting her 27 years of smoking before she quit in 2004.
“I was arrested for my involvement in student movements, and when the interrogator found a pack of cigarettes on me, he called me a ‘smoking whore.’ But the police offered cigarettes to male students, and I realized how a cigarette had different meanings for men and women,” she wrote.
Seo found it funny that just as women finally get to smoke in public without being scorned, both male and female smokers became the public enemy.
If you smoke in the bathroom or out on the balcony of your apartment, the neighbors will surely complain.
Smokers are a minority unworthy of pity in other countries as well.
Japan was known to be tolerant of smokers, but nowadays, smoking is prohibited on major city streets.
In January of 1994, a 3-year-old girl nearly lost her vision when a lit cigarette hit her in the eye at Funabashi Station in Chiba Prefecture, and Japan became increasingly concerned about smoking in public places ever since.
