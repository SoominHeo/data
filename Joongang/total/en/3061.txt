Under the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime, only five countries - America, Russia, China, the U.K. and France - are recognized as nuclear powers, while India, Pakistan and Israel are recognized as “de facto nuclear powers” outside the NPT.

The U.S. State Department stated it has maintained the position not to accept the North’s nuclear status for a long time, adding that Pyongyang must observe the Joint Statement it signed in Beijing on September 19, 2005.

The declaration of nuclear status in the Constitution has also made the 1992 Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula obsolete.
