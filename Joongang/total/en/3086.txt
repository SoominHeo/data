As part of the ban on Iranian oil trade in January, European insurers were prohibited from providing insurance to oil carriers shipping oil from Iran starting July 1.
If an oil carrier runs into an accident, the damage can amount to at least 1 trillion won ($859 billion).
Korean refiners must insure with European companies because there are few local insurers who can afford such a guarantee.
Without insurance from European companies, Korean refiners cannot get oil from Iran.
The government tried to negotiate with the EU, but so far has made little progress.
Insurance may be cut off from July and since oil freighters take more than a month to arrive on Korean shores, shipments will likely stop later this month.
