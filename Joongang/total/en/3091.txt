With both parties facing a myriad of political, economic and social issues to be addressed over the next four years, a crucial question still remains: whether representatives should be able to retain side jobs.

In the 18th National Assembly, 127 lawmakers - a whopping 42.8 percent - held other jobs as lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, patent agents and CEOs of private and public companies.

The 21st century calls for an assembly which can represent the growing demands of voters 365 days a year.

We hope our legislators will discuss this issue in a sincere manner and follow the example of the U.S. Congress, which strictly bans its members from earning more than 15 percent of their salaries in extra income.
