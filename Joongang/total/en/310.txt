As Chinese fishing boats have been illegally fishing for 18 years now, Korean fishermen are suffering from significant decreases in their catches.
Chinese fishing boats use fine nets in pair trawling, stripping from the bottom.
So fishermen took a risk, entering the restricted area on Sunday and capturing two Chinese boats.
It was only 550 meters (600 yards) from the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea.
After the incident, the fishermen were even more frustrated.
As if laughing at the capture, Chinese fishing boats illegally operated in the waters near Yeonpyeong Island for three consecutive days, and Korean authorities virtually condoned it.
Fishermen ask if it is really Korean territorial waters when more than 100 Chinese boats come within 150 meters of the Yeonpyeong Island coastline.
