The government must use every possible means, including international cooperation, to unveil how Shin died and if her two daughters are alive.
The government should ask the UN to confirm if the two daughters really want to remain in the North.


Pyongyang added that her two daughters donâ€™t want to see their father.

The misfortune of Shin and her two daughters began with her husband Oh, who still makes efforts to bring them back to the South.

Actually, Oh persuaded his family to go to North Korea in 1985 after having been cajoled by a famous South Korean composer from Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang, into defecting to the North when he was studying economics in West Germany.
