In many ways, the performance of the four-rivers restoration project will become an important measure of the Lee Myung-bak administration.

When Japan was defeated in World War II in August 1945, Tanaka was staying at an inn near Daejeon Station, as his company, Tanaka Civil Engineering and Construction Industries, had a branch there.

Similarly, President Lee started the controversial four-rivers restoration project.

But hopefully President Lee does not follow Tanakaâ€™s path in at least one aspect.

Before Tanaka passed away in 1993, he was indicted for his involvement in the Lockheed bribery scandals.
