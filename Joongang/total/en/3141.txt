Thanks to advancements in drugs and treatments, the rate of surviving more than five years after diagnosis has gone up to 62 percent.
The cancers with the highest survival rates — thyroid (99.7 percent), breast (90.6 percent), colorectal (71.3 percent) and stomach (65.3 percent) — are now seen as chronic diseases rather than fatal ones.

When including new patients from 2010, there must be more than a million battling the disease.

The cancers with the highest survival rates — thyroid (99.7 percent), breast (90.6 percent), colorectal (71.3 percent) and stomach (65.3 percent) — are now seen as chronic diseases rather than fatal ones.

A total of 808,503 people are still living after cancer diagnoses and treatments between 2000 and 2009.

When including new patients from 2010, there must be more than a million battling the disease.

With over one million cancer patients in our nation, we must think beyond the health aspects of the disease and work on ways to help people with their rehabilitation.

According to the National Cancer Center, 53 percent of patients lose their jobs and just 30.5 percent return to work after treatment.
