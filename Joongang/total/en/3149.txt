Recently, a research team at the University of Chicago surveyed citizens from 30 countries about the existence of God, and it led to interesting results.
While only 23 percent of respondents under age 27 said they believed in God, 43 percent of the group over age 68 held the opposite view.


In the package, I found two books written by Park and an introductory booklet in English.
