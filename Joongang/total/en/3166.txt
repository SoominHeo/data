The revised bill concerning the use of physical force requires punitive action to be taken against lawmakers who disrupt legislative procedures, for instance, by banning their entry to the Assembly for three months and cutting their allowances.
But these measures are too light to be totally effective, especially when lawmakers routinely threaten to resign from their posts in protest of new bills.
Recently, for example, three members of the opposition Democratic Party handed in their resignations to protest the passage of the media law.
