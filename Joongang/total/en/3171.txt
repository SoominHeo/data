Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests after launching a long-range missile in 2006 and 2009.
It is expected to do the same this time.
As the UN councilâ€™s presidential statement warns clearly, its third nuclear test will no doubt invite an immediate reaction from the council.


The stern statement came just three days after Pyongyang pushed ahead with the launch in violation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1874, which strictly bans the North from launching any long-range missiles.

Yet it contains clauses which mandate reinforced sanctions against the North as a result of the earlier Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874.
