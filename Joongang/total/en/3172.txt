9, which was constructed and is run by a private company, is in hot water for its surprising announcement that it will raise fares.

Under the agreement signed with the Seoul Metropolitan government in 2005, which authorizes the private operator to set the prices, the company does nothing wrong in raising the fares.

As it turns out, the company’s losses have piled up to 182 billion won because it could not raise fares due to the city government’s pressure to keep them low.

According to the contract, the city administration must compensate for any losses from the operation and guarantees up to 90 percent of the private operator’s estimated income.
