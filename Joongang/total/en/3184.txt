I had a chance to interview Kenichi Ohmae, an internationally renowned business consultant and economic commentator, seven years ago in Tokyo.
The two-hour-long interview was especially memorable because I asked questions without reservation, and he gave straightforward answers.

I wonder what Ohmae would say about the fates of the two companies now.
