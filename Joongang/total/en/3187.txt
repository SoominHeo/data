Today, the area is still important militarily.
On the left side of Yalong Bay is Sanya Naval Base of the People’s Liberation Army, made up of two docking facilities and four piers.


Though there were only a couple of resorts on the island eight years ago, the deserted beach has turned into a popular vacation destination as resorts and hotels by global brands are constructed along the coastline.
