Manjiro Tatsumi is a master of Noh, one of three traditional Japanese performing arts.
He is a member of the Shitegata Hosho School and has performed around the globe, notably on special occasions at the United Nations and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as well as in front of the Sphinx in Egypt.
Just like Kim, Tatsumi began his career early, with his first public performance at the age of 4.
Last Monday, these two masters met at the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Seoul.
