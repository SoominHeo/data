Only five restaurants are participating in the festival.
Most of the preparation was to encourage participation and promote the event to Korean consumers.
A travel operator insider who wishes to remain anonymous said, “The sale percentage and participants were finalized at the last minute and there has been little PR abroad, so not many foreign tourists planned their trips to go shopping in Korea during this event.”
Another department store employee said, “While the department store uses its own marketing channels to promote the sale to Japan and China, it is regrettable that overseas PR efforts on the festival itself were poor.”
Social media is also very quiet.
The Facebook video featuring B2B, Baek Ji-young and Hong Soo-ah is in Korean only, and as of Sept. 28, it has 185 views.


It’s getting bigger and bigger, the Korea Sale FESTA from Sept. 29 to Oct. 31.

On Sept. 28, discounts on mobile phones, a must-have for all Koreans, were announced.

Among countless hotels in Korea, only 25 of them posted the coupon on their English website, indicating they offer discounts for foreign visitors.
