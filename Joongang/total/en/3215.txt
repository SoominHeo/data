In a podcast, unionized journalists of public broadcaster KBS, who are currently on strike, revealed 2,619 reports of spying activities drawn up by the public ethics team.

The revelation adds an entirely new twist to the prosecution’s investigation, which has been focused on the illegal surveillance of only one person - Kim Jong-ik, head of a financial subsidiary of KB Financial Group, who posted a video ridiculing the president on the Internet - and the government’s attempt to cover up the spying.
