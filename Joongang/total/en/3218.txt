The Japanese yen, which appreciated to as high as 75 yen to the U.S. dollar in the midst of great economic uncertainty, has fallen to 83 yen to the greenback — perhaps signalling the end of the era of a super-strong yen.

The yen’s volatility directly affects the Korean economy as industrial players of the two countries are major rivals in mainstream exports of electronics, automobiles and chemicals.
