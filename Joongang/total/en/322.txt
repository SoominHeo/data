It was about 30 minutes after the departure time.
Passengers didn’t seem to be stirred.
Then, I saw a friend’s post about the Guui Station accident.
He was furious that a worker was killed at 5:57 pm, and the subway resumed operations 26 minutes later.

But it takes just 20 minutes to settle the scene.

At first, I heard the authorities blamed the dead worker.

Finally, the flight departed after a two-hour delay and arrived two hours after the scheduled time.
