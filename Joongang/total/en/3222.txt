Unlike other expositions, the Yeosu Expo will be held in a small city of just 300,000, far away from the capital and major cities.
Kang Dong-suk, chairman of the organizing committee, said the goal is to turn the expo into an event for the entire southern coastal region, not just for Yeosu.
Under the theme “The Living Ocean and Coast,” the exhibition involves 2,500 small and large islands and the sea coast linking Yeosu, Namhae, Goheung, Gwangyang, Busan and Jeju.
The lodging and traffic has been spread across the entire southern coast with a long-term vision to unite the southern coastal region as a maritime tourism belt.
A total of 10 trillion won ($8.8 billion) was spent on constructing roads and traffic infrastructure along the southern coast.
The bullet train can arrive in Yeosu from Seoul within three hours and 30 minutes, which will be shortened to two hours and 50 minutes by the time the expo begins.
