As Pyongyang does not appear to be willing to give up its plan despite mounting pressure, the volatile situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula will likely deteriorate fast after mid-April.
All parties involved are particularly concerned about the possibility of another nuclear test.
South Korea, the United States, Japan and other Western allies are expected to push forward stronger sanctions against the North as Pyongyang’s satellite launch violates the UN resolution.
The possibility of stricter sanctions being unanimously agreed upon could be low due to expected opposition from China and Russia.
Yet Western allies, led by Seoul, Washington and Tokyo, in particular, will most likely push ahead with tougher sanctions to penalize Pyongyang’s repetitive breach of the resolution.
Then, Pyongyang would possibly conduct a third nuclear test in defiance of international criticism.


The White House and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations have stressed that such a move clearly violates UN Security Council Resolution 1874.

As Pyongyang does not appear to be willing to give up its plan despite mounting pressure, the volatile situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula will likely deteriorate fast after mid-April.

Then, Pyongyang would possibly conduct a third nuclear test in defiance of international criticism.

The government must not repeat the nightmarish moment of “being capable of doing nothing” in 2006 and 2009, when Pyongyang brazenly conducted underground nuclear tests.
