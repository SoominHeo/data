Pyongyang went so far as to argue that a “suppression of such a right is equivalent to a mean action negating our intrinsic rights to make  peaceful use of space and infringing our sovereignty,” just as it said at the time of the launch of the Kwangmyongsong-1 and 2.
If it’s about the peaceful use of space, why would China - Pyongyang’s blood ally - instantly express its worry and raise the question of responsibility?
Civilian rocket technologies are almost identical to those of military missiles.
That’s why the international community regards the North’s allegedly peaceful rocket launch as a long-range missile test.

Should the test go forward, Pyongyang will have to give up the 240,000 metric tons of nutritional aid promised by Washington.


The international community is pressuring North Korea to suspend its plan to test-fire the Kwangmyongsong-3, an intercontinental ballistic missile disguised as a satellite.

South Korea, the United States, Japan, the EU, China and Russia have all expressed their worries about Pyongyang’s scheme to shoot the “satellite” into orbit via the Euha-3 rocket.
