The seven-volume series chronicles the turbulent life of Ibuki Shinsuke, who was born in a mining village in Kyushu in imperial Japan.

The author notes that Japan has been pushed out of the position of the second largest economy in the world, acknowledging the fact that Japan is descending now.

Her perspective is similar to Itsukiâ€™s idea that the Japanese are increasingly unhappy because of the conventional mindset to pursue growth, with over 30,000 people killing themselves every year.
