At my friend’s taxi company, two drivers have been beaten up by drunk passengers and are currently in the hospital.
This dangerous profession is increasingly attracting middle-aged or senior drivers.
Of the 287,660 registered taxi drivers in the country at the end of 2011, 31,438 were seniors over the age of 65.
Ten years ago in 2001, there were only 4,302 drivers who were older than 65.
The number of senior drivers continued to increase every year and surpassed 10,000 in 2005.
The number went up to 20,000 in 2008, and another 10,000 were added after three years.
Bus drivers are also getting increasingly older.
The National Taxi Association Joint Conference confirmed that 1,928 drivers passed the taxi license test in January and more than half, or 1,006, were over 50.
