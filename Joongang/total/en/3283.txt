I was sorting the recycling one day when I brought the recycling bin down to the sorting area, only to find the bin was nowhere to be found once I had finished my job.

The recycling bin was left alone, and one of the residents driving by thought it was waste and took it.

The positive aspect of crime prevention overrides the negative one of compromised privacy, and yet a bitter feeling remains.
