Those who die arrive every Monday and are then instructed to choose the happiest moment of their lives before they are sent off to the next world with that one memory.

One person names the day he ate a lunch prepared by his mom on a swing in a bamboo forest.

If you want one happy memory to carry with you into the next life, it should be something that gives you eternal joy.
