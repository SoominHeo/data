Hanwha, one of the country’s 10 largest conglomerates, clearly violated stock market regulations 

Investigators have been probing the embezzlement case since January of last year, but the stock exchange has not pressed the company to disclose information on the case in a bid to protect investors.

The graft in this case amounts to 3.88 percent of Hanwha’s net capital.

Last year, 13 companies were kicked out of the technology-laden Kosdaq market after being linked to cases of graft and misappropriated funds.
