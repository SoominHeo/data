Research shows that measures are needed to tackle the growing scourge of game addiction among Korean students, as 470,000, or 6.5 percent, of elementary, middle and high school students, are excessively immersed in games.

Meanwhile, children from low-income families seem more prone to game addiction, as are children with two working parents.

More than half of the students who spend more than four hours a day playing games said in a survey that they had no interference from their parents.
