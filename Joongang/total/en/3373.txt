Despite the stalemate between South and North Korea, production and the number of North Korean workers at Kaesong Industrial Complex have risen consistently since 2010.
According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Unification, the special economic zone in the North has produced $369.86 million worth of goods from January through November last year, a whopping 25.7 percent increase over the same period in 2010.

Moreover, our companies complain that they need about 20,000 to 25,000 more North Korean workers to run their business there.
Though the problem can partly be attributed to the government’s ban on further investment in the complex after the North’ attacks on the Cheonan warship and Yeonpyeong Island, it primarily results from the lack of available North Korean workers.
