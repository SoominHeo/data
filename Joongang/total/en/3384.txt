We welcome Park’s remarks, given citizens’ fervent desire for a genuine revolution in the candidate nomination process ahead of the legislative elections in April.

This is in sharp contrast to how it conducted itself in the legislative elections four years ago, when the pro-Lee Myung-bak faction wielded absolute influence in the nominations.

The party has also decided to split its electoral college into the general public (80 percent) and party members (20 percent) who regularly pay their dues.

The DUP is no exception: It plans to select 70 percent of its candidates through public participation in voting and 30 percent based on traditional top-down nominations.
