In comparison, King Sejong, who is praised as the greatest king of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea, ascended to the throne at age 22 in 1418, following the abdication of his father, King Taejong.

When his father died four years later, Sejong was finally able to demonstrate his abilities as a ruler.

They are worried that young Koreans armed with social networking services may rise against the establishment and start “Occupy 2012” demonstrations.
