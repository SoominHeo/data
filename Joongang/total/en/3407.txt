When the French First Republic was established as a result of the French Revolution, the government replaced the Gregorian calendar with the French Republican calendar.

The Republican calendar begins with Vendemiaire, the month of the grape harvest, which corresponds to September.

The two incidents took place in the same period, only 12 years apart, and the two have something in common.

Of course, it may be cruel to compare the president to the Jacobins, who divided a day into 10 hours and each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and the Qing emperor, who ordered his ministers to travel 280 kilometers.
