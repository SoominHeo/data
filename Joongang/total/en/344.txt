STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding, which used to be the world’s fourth largest shipbuilder in terms of orders, is headed for court receivership.
The company’s creditors concluded in a meeting Wednesday that they no longer can afford to sustain the money-losing shipbuilder that was placed under their management in April 2013 and decided to take insolvency procedures.
Financial Services Commission Chairman Yim Jong-yong confirmed the planned move, saying it was an “inevitable” decision considering various factors.
STX ran into trouble by trying to keep orders pouring in by offering bargain contracts amid reduced demand following the global financial crisis in 2008.
