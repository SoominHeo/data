The ordinance is expected to go into effect in March at the start of the new school term, but private and public schools in the capital are agonizing over whether to adhere to it - unless it is killed or revised before the new term begins.
If it is enforced, schools may find their teachers shunning direct, one-on-one contact with their students to avoid any potential conflict, which threatens to jeopardize the quality of education students receive.


A revised version of a proposed students’ rights ordinance was finally passed in Seoul this week to serve as the first-ever piece of legislation aimed at protecting students’ rights in the history of the nation.

The ordinance is expected to go into effect in March at the start of the new school term, but private and public schools in the capital are agonizing over whether to adhere to it - unless it is killed or revised before the new term begins.

If it is enforced, schools may find their teachers shunning direct, one-on-one contact with their students to avoid any potential conflict, which threatens to jeopardize the quality of education students receive.

It also makes it imperative that schools convene committee meetings to decide how to change their regulations before the March deadline.
