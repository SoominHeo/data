Seoul Station has banned the homeless from sleeping overnight in the waiting area since August.
On Dec. 2, the National Human Rights Commission informed the Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs that it will vote on a recommendation to retract the ban.


The city leased the building in October to set up the “Freedom Cafe for the Homeless.”

There are 39 homeless shelters and many service and counseling centers in Seoul.
