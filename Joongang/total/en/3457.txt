The GNP is weighing two paths.
One is to conduct reform while retaining the party identity.
The other is to dissolve the party and organize an entirely new one.
The emergency council will choose between the two.
Should Park take the lead, she will likely seek opinions from inside and outside the party.
Whether it decides on a renovated house or entirely new one, the GNP will not likely be welcomed by the public if its contents remain unchanged.
The executive committee discussed whether the party revamp should be a complete or partial makeover and whether to maintain the emergency council until the legislative elections in April or hold a party convention.
