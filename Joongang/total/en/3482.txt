New broadcasting station JTBC reported that former President Chun Doo Hwan regretted his 1980 decision to merge newspaper and broadcasting organizations.
TBC - Tongyang Broadcasting Company - had been shut down as a part of the plan under his military government.
It is the first time the general-turned-president expressed regret over his decision.
Lee Won-hong, culture and information minister who served under Chun, said his former boss was sorry that he did not undo the damage he caused to the nationâ€™s media broadcasting industry before he stepped down.
On Nov. 12, 1980, soon after the deadly and controversial military clampdown on the democracy movement in Gwangju, presidents and publishers of media companies were summoned to the security command headquarters.
In the presence of armed soldiers, they had to sign contracts to close down newspaper or broadcasting organizations.
As a result, 64 media companies, including TBC, were massacred under the security law.
