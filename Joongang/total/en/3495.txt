Abraham Lincoln was also once criticized as a traitor.

President James Polk wanted to start a war against Mexico, but the 38-year-old congressman was firmly opposed, arguing that the clash that would start the war took place in a disputed border region, not in American territory.

Nevertheless, Lincoln was branded a traitor, lost his seat and could not get into politics for over 10 years.
