About 100 activists broke the police line and jumped over the walls to get into the assembly.
With this action, the symbol of a democratic system has been violated.
A couple of days ago, a police security guard in front of the National Assembly building was beaten by a mob of activists protesting against the FTA.
He was stepped on and kicked when he fell to the ground while trying to disperse the group.
He had been merely doing his job, but was brutally hit and humiliated in broad daylight.
He could have been seriously injured if his peers had not pulled him out of the ring in time.
And it was not just one police officer who was hurt.
