There are about 85 welfare centers, including 44 shelters and eight institutions for the homeless.
Many of them are empty.
Railroad authorities decided to evict the homeless from Seoul Station because of complaints about drinking, fights, violence and begging.
Many homeless people drink in groups in corners of the station from daytime and demand money from passengers.
They dominate the station after dark.
A female passenger in her 50s was stabbed by one.
This incident led authorities to ban the homeless from staying overnight at the station in August to protect passengers.
