One of the things I found interesting when I first visited Japan was that people were comfortable eating alone at a restaurant.

In Han Sang-bok’s “If You Are Lonely, All is Well,” the author divided “being alone” into two categories, citing Harvard University Professor Paul Tillich.

As Confucius once said, “Learning without thought is labor lost.”

At first, the lone diners in Japan seemed strange and awkward.
