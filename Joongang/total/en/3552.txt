I noticed that one bear was walking the same path over and over.
He would walk to the edge of the cage, turn his head, walk back and repeat the pattern.
Its behavior is similar to a child who develops a tic when under extreme stress.
It happens to tigers and lions as well, but polar bears are especially prone to this behavior.
In the wild, a polar bear’s boundary of movement is over 80,000 square kilometers (30,888 square miles).
It is only natural that being confined to a small space with only a tiny pool would put it under tremendous stress.
The polar bear in his cage reminds me of the appointments made 
The president has created controversy with his tendency to make appointments based on academic, religious and regional favoritism - and repeated the same pattern over and over again.
The administration’s tendency toward cronyism is serious.
A friend of mine holds a public position.
He said that although the position was advertised, his selection was predetermined thanks to his personal connections.
He even visited the office before the recruiting began to meet with the staff.
At the interview, he said that, while he was waiting with other candidates, he grew nervous because he was worried that one of the staff members he had met would talk to him, and he did not want the other candidates to realize the interview did not matter.


The zoo nearly shut down in the mid-1990s, when the number of visitors declined significantly.
