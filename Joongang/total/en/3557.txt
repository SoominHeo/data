In October 1415, the English achieved a major victory over the French when they attacked the small town of Agincourt in northern France in what would become known as the Battle of Agincourt.
The French had overwhelming strength, so they opened the gates and marched out with their cavalry in front.
But the English longbowmen, who were laying in wait, began shooting all at once.
When the French began falling from their horses, the English stormed in.
This made the French soldiers furious and they threatened to cut off the longbowmenâ€™s index and middle fingers so they would never be able to shoot arrows again.
But in a defiant gesture, the English lifted the two fingers into a V and showed off, mocking the French.
