Yesterday, Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang agreed to raise the cap on currency swaps from $26 billion to $56 billion.
Thanks to the effort, Korea gains a considerably stronger defense against steep fluctuations in exchange rates.
If you add the latest currency swap to an earlier $70 billion swap with Japan in addition to our foreign reserves of $303.3 billion, the total amount of reserves available at times of crisis will balloon to $430 billion.

The interest rates our government must pay after borrowing money from foreign countries will also go down, which is one of the biggest benefits from the currency swap arrangement with China.
