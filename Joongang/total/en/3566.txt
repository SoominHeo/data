After my title was taken away and I was expelled from the palace 575 years ago, my own father strangled me to death.

The one sin I committed was having special affection for Sossang, my handmaid.

Researchers have found that about 5 percent of the population is attracted to members of the same sex because of genetic qualities with which they are born.

I have waited 575 years, maybe Iâ€™ll have to wait another couple more decades.
