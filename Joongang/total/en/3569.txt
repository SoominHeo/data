In a nationwide televised address on Dec. 20, Obama announced his plan to form a legislature comprised of citizens selected through a lottery system from all 50 states and replace the House of Representatives.

In describing his plans for the Citizen Legislature, the president said that scientific advancements allowed the government to make a sample size that precisely represented the nation’s voters, creating a “miniature America” of 500 citizens from all walks of life and proportional representation of gender, race, age, region, occupation, income, political tendency and religion.

In the House today, 80 percent of the seats are currently occupied by wealthy white men and 40 percent are attorneys.
