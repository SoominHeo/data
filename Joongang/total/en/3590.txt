The other 24 libraries in the district have been closed on Sundays for a while.
As soon as I entered the library, I saw the sign announcing that the library would be closed on Sundays beginning this month.
Every visitor stopped and read that sign.
An elderly man named Scott, who was at the information desk, said that the library had never closed in the 30 years he had been working there, except for renovation and reconstruction projects.


A young African-American man in shabby clothing waited in line for 20 minutes to use a computer in the center of the lobby.

This is the libraryâ€™s first closure since its opening.
