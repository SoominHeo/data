President Park Geun-hye this year was again absent at the ceremony at the May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju commemorating the 36th anniversary of the democratization movement.

The May 18 Democratization Movement was a civilian uprising against dictatorship.

The sacred sacrifice by Gwangju civilians led to a nationwide democratization movement in June 1987 and established the Constitution, ensuring the democratic system we enjoy today.

Politicians regardless of their party allegiance must pay respect to the victims of the May 18 movement and remember their legacy.

The May 18 spirit must be freed from politics and genuinely honored as a proud part of our history.
