President Barack Obama submitted to the U.S. Congress yesterday a bill seeking approval of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement - four years after both governments signed it.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida and chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has said that there will be no more obstacles to the ratification of the trade deal in the House.
As the bill represents the outcome of close consultations between the White House and the House leadership, the possibility that it will be ratified before President Lee Myung-bakâ€™s state visit to Washington on Oct. 13 is even stronger than before.
