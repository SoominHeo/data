Therefore, Level 3 and 4 victims, including Park, did not receive notification concerning the meeting schedule for the official apology and compensation plan.
The official apology, scheduled for May 20, is the first meeting between Oxy and the victims.
However, the Level 3 and 4 victims, who did not get the text message are hurt once again.

Experts say that determining the health effect of humidifier sterilizers based on lung damage was not sufficient.
Recently, the Ministry of Environment announced a plan to operate a subcommittee to review diseases other than lung damage as a result of the use of humidifier sterilizers.
However, the classification system that the government came up with two years ago, without basing it on sufficient investigation, subsequently resulted in the victims being categorized that way.
Oxy sent text messages selectively based on this classification.


After using the Oxy brand humidifier sterilizer, he suffered rashes, a sinus infection, rhinitis, skin problems and has been designated a Level 3 victim.

The company is trying to only apologize to the Level 1 and 2 victims.”

Therefore, Level 3 and 4 victims, including Park, did not receive notification concerning the meeting schedule for the official apology and compensation plan.

However, the Level 3 and 4 victims, who did not get the text message are hurt once again.

Level 1 victims are the one whose lung damage had an “almost clear” causal relation with sterilizer use, and Level 2 victims are the ones with “highly possible” causal relation.

The Level 3 and 4 victims suffer from other conditions, but because no lung damage was confirmed, they were excluded from government assistance for medical and funeral expenses.
