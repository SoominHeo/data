In September 2010, a fire at a gosiwon in Sincheon- dong, eastern Seoul, killed 11 people.
Yet, gosiwon accommodate more than 100,000 people in Seoul, or nearly 1 percent of the population.

The dream of one gosiwon resident recently came to an end.

When he was 12, he left the facility and lived by begging on the street and doing manual labor.
Based on his generosity, he must have lived thinking about children in similar situations.
