A friend of mine called one day and wanted to have a drink.
He said he had stormed out of his house after an intense quarrel.
He has been married long enough to know better than to fight with his wife, but he is in his 40s and still thinks that he can stand up against his wife.
It was an inconceivably bold act.
I told him he should go back immediately, apologize for his challenge and keep himself out of sight for a while.
After a few drinks, I pushed him back home.
We’ve all had our share of family fights.
I, too, had intense quarrels with my wife when I was naive.
One day, all of a sudden, it occurred to me that I should no longer live this way.
Most of all, it was embarrassing to be a father who fought with his wife in front of my children.
At the same time, the quarrels and tensions made my life miserable.
So I hypnotized myself, telling myself that my wife is the sun of my household.
At the same time, I vowed that a quarrel with my wife was no longer in my dictionary.
Mysteriously, peace came to my home.
Anxiety disappeared from the faces of my children, and our home was filled with refreshing energy and happy laughter.
I do not go against my wife’s words; actually, I agree with just about everything she says.
When she is in a good mood, I casually throw in my opinions.
I guarantee a 100-percent success rate.
