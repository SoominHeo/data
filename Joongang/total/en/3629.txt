It is a set of cognitive optical illusions that look either like a vase or like two faces looking at each other.

Depending on which part you consider the figure and which you consider the background, the black and white areas separated by a common border can be interpreted in two ways.

Most importantly, you can only see either the vase or the faces at one time, but you can never see them together.

One online television network, for instance, airs professional baseball games in a way that is reminiscent of Rubinâ€™s vase.
