When an earthquake and tsunami battered power stations in Japan, the Tokyo government enforced an electricity usage cut of 15 percent.
Japanese people joined energy-saving campaigns and brought down their use of energy by 10 percent, leading to overall electricity consumption going down by 25 percent.


But the problem was that 23 power plants were under regular maintenance that usually takes place in sequence during spring and autumn.

If the reserve ratio slips below 5 percent, rolling blackouts are inevitable.

Since we cannot expect immediate increases in supply - new plants arenâ€™t scheduled to open until 2015 - we can only choose to use less energy.
