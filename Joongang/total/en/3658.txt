The father of Song Hye-hee, an 18-year-old high school girl who went missing in 1999, gave up his life and began traveling the country to look for her, while her mother committed suicide out of depression.
The father has carried out his search for 12 years and has said he has only one wish before he dies: to see his daughterâ€™s face just one more time.


In modern times, families are separated by other means, and every year about 30,000 cases of missing persons are reported.
