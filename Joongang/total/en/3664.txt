In 16th century England, a despicable person was referred to as a cat.

The general public became familiar with the phrase copycat crime after the release of the Hollywood thriller “Copycat” in 1995.

In March, then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs criticized products by Samsung, Google and Motorola as copycats while presenting the new iPad model.

Jobs’ comments may have prompted Samsung to pull its newest tablet model, the Galaxy Tab 7.7, from the IFA Berlin International Consumer Electronics Trade Fair right before the opening of the event earlier this month.
