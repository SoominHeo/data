According to a legend, the mute swan is silent its whole life until just before death, when it sings one beautiful song.

The tale has given humans the notion of the “swan song” - that final gesture one makes just before retirement or death.

However, the idea that a swan sings only once in its life is a scientifically ungrounded myth.
