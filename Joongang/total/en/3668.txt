Its ultra-loose monetary policy, quantitative easing and aggressive fiscal spending over the last three years have failed to turn the economy around and stabilize the job market.
Authorities simply exhausted their bag of tricks without seeing any positive tangible results.
In return for its hard-won Congressional endorsement to raise the ceiling for federal debt, the U.S. government promised more austerity and tightening measures.

The U.S. benchmark interest rate is already close to zero and more quantitative easing is out of the question, given that the Consumer Price Index is already hovering around 3.6 percent.
