Pope John Paul II passed away on April 2, 2005, and two days later, a strange thing happened in London.

The wedding was originally to take place on April 8, but when the pope died, his funeral was scheduled for the same date.

People wanting a Birkin bag often wait at least a year or two before they can buy one.
