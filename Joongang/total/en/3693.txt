The prosecution arrested five members of the spy ring yesterday on charges of espionage, obtaining illicit infiltration and organizing and joining an antistate association.
The ringleader of the group, who was an avid follower of the North’s Juche (self-reliance) ideology, had reportedly pledged allegiance to the Workers’ Party and Kim Jong-il after vowing to struggle for revolution.
He attracted several members to the spy ring after receiving a secret order from the Workers’ Party’s foreign liaison department in 2001.
The agents collected data on our government’s political and military activities as well as the trends of dissident groups.
Wangjaesan attempted to infiltrate the political arena, with the Assembly speaker’s secretary playing a central role.
The authorities in charge of public security regard the group’s activities as evidence that Pyongyang seeks to win over key figures to form its unification front in the upper echelon of our society.
It feels similar to the German case - in which East Germany implanted over 30,000 resident agents in West Germany to curry favor with politicians, bureaucrats and college students.
