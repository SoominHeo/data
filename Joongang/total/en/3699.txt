Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s 42-year-old tyrannical rule is finally over.

The UN Security Council’s resolution on military intervention and NATO’s bombing raids helped anti-Qaddafi forces gain a priceless victory in just six months.

No doubt it will not be easy for the country to jettison the residue of despotism, both physical and mental, and establish a democratic system, given the internal schism among over 140 tribal groups.

As Libya’s overseas assets amount to $100 billion, a massive reconstruction project is expected.
