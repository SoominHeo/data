How many would believe that all things living and dead exist on the dirty streets and breath stinky air in the dumpster and crumbling buildings?” A class of urban poor sprang up in England during the industrial revolution, when laborers commonly toiled for 18 hours a day to make their living.
Saving the poor was a national task.
However, the New Poor Law legislated in 1834 could not meet its goal.


But Charles Dickens may have captured the main gist of it when he described London’s slums in the weekly magazine “Household Words” back in 1850.

How many would believe that all things living and dead exist on the dirty streets and breath stinky air in the dumpster and crumbling buildings?” A class of urban poor sprang up in England during the industrial revolution, when laborers commonly toiled for 18 hours a day to make their living.

However, the New Poor Law legislated in 1834 could not meet its goal.

Charles Dickens’ classic novel “Oliver Twist” (1837) is known as a fine piece of social criticism shown through the prism of a young boy who survives life at a miserable workhouse.

The book is a dark portrayal of 19th-century England, which is when the Salvation Army was organized to bring some relief to poor by offering them soap and soup.

The situation had not improved much in the early 20th century, as Jack London found when he wrote “The People of the Abyss” in 1902.
