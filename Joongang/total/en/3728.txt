China has finally completed the reconstruction of the Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag, which was purchased from Ukraine in 1998.
The newly refurbished 60,000-ton carrier is set to launch this month.


The fleet was comprised of 55 vessels, including eight cruisers, with a total loading capacity of 50,000 tons.

The battle ended in Chinaâ€™s defeat with the loss of five warships and 850 soldiers.

For the over 100 years since, China has not achieved notable naval capacity.
