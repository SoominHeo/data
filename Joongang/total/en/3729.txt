The Korus FTA is finally on the threshold of ratification in both countries after having traveled a thorny five-year path from the Roh Moo-hyun administration to the Lee Myung-bak administration.
We feel deeply ashamed that Chun, who served as the justice minister under the Roh administration, has even attempted to urge his counterparts not to ratify the pact now.
His claim - that a majority of Koreans are worried about the pact - is also groundless.
At the start of the Lee administration, many people were opposed to the trade deal because of increasing worry about mad cow disease with U.S. beef imports.
But that has changed.
According to a survey conducted after the Korea-EU FTA was successfully ratified by both sides, an overwhelming majority of people said they support the Korus FTA.
Another survey by the DP shows that 75 percent believe the Korus FTA will help boost our national interests.
