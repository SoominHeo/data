The number of suspected cases of insurance fraud increased from 26,754 in 2006 to 54,268 in 2009.
However, the industry estimates only 10 percent of the cases have been prosecuted.


Insurance fraud is a favorite subject of crime films such as “Double Indemnity,” Billy Wilder’s 1944 classic, and this year’s “Suspicious Customers” starring Ryu Seung-beom.

The Financial Supervisory Service in 2004 installed an insurance fraud detection system ti analyze a database of insurance contracts and accident information to automatically generate a list of suspects.

The number of suspected cases of insurance fraud increased from 26,754 in 2006 to 54,268 in 2009.

However, the industry estimates only 10 percent of the cases have been prosecuted.

If 90 percent of the criminals behind these cases are not caught, more people may be tempted to commit similar crimes.
