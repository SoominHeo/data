Goryeo period Buddhist monk Gakhun wrote “Lives of Eminent Korean Monks” in 1215.
According to Venerable Gakhun, the Indian monk Marananta arrived in Korea in 384, the first year of the reign of King Chimryu, the 15th king of Baekje.
The purpose of Marananta’s visit was to bring Buddhist teachings to Korea.
However, while he travelled from India to Baekje via China, he became ill because he was not accustomed to local food and water.
Upon his arrival in Korea, he drank spring water from a mountain in what is now Seoul and recovered.
To celebrate its healing power, he established Daeseong Chodang, which is the predecessor of Daeseong Temple.
Located on Mount Umyeon, Seocho-dong, the temple was destroyed during the Korean War, but was rebuilt in 1954.
The 293-meter tall mountain is named Umyeon, or sleeping cow.

Foreign residents and tourists say one of the charms of Seoul is its easily assessable mountains and Mount Umyeon offers great hiking trails.

In December 1999, the equivalent of two years worth of rain inundated Vargas State.

The slums at the foot of the mountain were completely buried, killing more than 30,000.

Perhaps the Nature and Ecological Park, which opened in July 2004, was the cause of the disaster.
