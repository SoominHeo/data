When Radcliffe appeared in the third film, “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” in 2004, he was obviously different from the boy in the second film, “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.”
In the “Azkaban” book, which was originally released in 1999, Harry is still a 13-year-old boy, but Radcliffe had turned 15 by the time the movie came out.
To address this problem, the film characters were redrawn to match the adolescent actors.
J.K. Rowling began reflecting these changes in the sixth book, “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.”

But unlike his character, Atsumi was a shy man.
When he realized that people expected him to behave like Torajiro, Atsumi chose a life of seclusion.
He wouldn’t go out with his fellow actors and he wouldn’t even speak on the phone.
In a recent interview, Radcliffe said that the last 10 years were wonderful, but he no longer wants to hear people asking him to do magic.
He said he was happy when someone complimented his acting in the play “Equus.”


J.K. Rowling began reflecting these changes in the sixth book, “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.”

Japanese actor Kiyoshi Atsumi, who starred in 48 episodes of Yoji Yamada’s “It’s Tough Being a Man” series, responded to this problem in an eccentric way.
