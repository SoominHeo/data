The Ministry of Environment has been reluctant to figure out exact causes for the deaths — and slow in helping victims — since 2011 when humidifier sterilizers proved to be the very cause for the deaths and ever since 2013 when the incumbent minister Yoon took office.
The ministry didn’t took follow-up measures like additional research and study, saying, “no clear causal relationship was found” even when a disinfectant containing the hazardous CMIT or MIT chemical already led to a number of deaths at the time.
The ministry also turned away from other related illnesses than lung injuries.
In particular, Minister Yoon made shocking remarks at an Environment and Labor Committee meeting in 2013 that he does not believe it is right for the government to take responsibility for what the public pays for with their tax money.
But in Wednesday’s meeting, he flip-flopped and said.
“The ministry is consulting with other ministries to offer financial support for victims.”
In the meantime, a multitude of victims had to live in desperation and pain.
Yet the ministry has not investigated how disinfectant and other sanitizers have been sold in the markets over the last five years.
