If two people try to sleep in a jjokbang, they have to curl up in order to fit.

After a police crackdown in 1968, the red light district was shuttered and day laborers seeking cheap housing moved to the area to look for jjokbang.

There are still 3,508 jjokbang units in the Jongno, Yongsan, Yeongdeungpo and Jung districts in Seoul.
