If that’s the reality at the country’s 100 largest corporate names, like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, we hardly need to look into board affairs of smaller companies.
The operation of outside directorship is flawed from hiring.
Outside board members in theory should be nominated by an interim committee and approved at shareholders’ meetings.
But in reality, they are named by the largest shareholders, chairman or chief executive.
They are mostly their acquaintances and are lawyers, professors, corporate executives and retired government officials.
They are paid as much as 100 million won ($94,500) a year.
The money would be well spent if their presence enhanced transparency.
But we cannot expect such contributions from acquaintances and friends of board members.
Many don’t even attend the board meetings.
Others say outside directors can’t object to board decisions because of their cozy relationships with shareholders and chief executives.
Many are also unfamiliar with the corporate world and lack the expertise to oppose policies.
The current outside board system is more or less useless.
The system should be revamped starting with the recruitment process.
Owners and CEOs must first change their mind-set and hire people who can really benefit the company.
