With the launch of the liberal Kim Dae-jung administration in 1998, most of the Kim Young-sam administration’s policies toward the North were tossed in the rubbish bin.
The Roh Moo-hyun administration’s engagement policies with the North faced the same fate after the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration came to power.
To put it simply, there’s not much consistency in our government’s policies toward the North, and that only fuels internal conflict in our society.
It is, of course, legitimate for a new administration to take a different approach, especially if it won power promising new policies.
But if the new president reverses his predecessor’s positions without deep reflection on the overall state of bilateral relations, he will always be starting from scratch without the benefit of  previous experience and know-how on North Korea.
One typical example is the joint declaration for the development of inter-Korean relations, peace and prosperity between President Roh and Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang on October 4, 2007.
