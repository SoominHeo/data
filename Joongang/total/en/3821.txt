But the Guggenheim’s prominence would not have been possible without Solomon’s niece Peggy Guggenheim (1898-1979).
She was a passionate art collector and used her enormous inheritance to build her collection.
She purchased the works by artists who would later become masters, such as Picasso, Kandinsky, Chagall and Klee.
Her keen eye ensured that she was not just another collector.
She contributed to the creation of new trends in contemporary art.
The Guggenheim Foundation is a pioneer in museum management as well.
Upon Peggy’s death in 1979, it assumed management of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.
In 1997, it opened satellite museums in Bilbao, Spain, and Berlin.
Bilbao had been a declining industrial town, but it has proven how much a city can change when a world-class museum moves in.
For the next three months, the Guggenheim in New York will host “Marking Infinity,” an exhibition of the work of Lee Ufan, 75.


In the United States, businessman and philanthropist Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861-1949) used his fortune from the mining business to support artists.

Today, the Guggenheim maintains a collection of more than 3,000 paintings, sculptures and graphic art.
