There are over 100 local play productions about the life of Bao Zheng, and his name on his tombstone has worn off as visitors touch it to pay their respects.
If Bao Zheng valued integrity over family ties, Jeong Yak-yong compared it to chastity.
“Integrity of government officials is like the chastity of a woman and even the slightest stain will leave a mark forever.
A dark room does not grant secrecy as four know.”
