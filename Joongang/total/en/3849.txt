Dartmouth College does not ask students to pay at all if their parents’ income is less than $75,000.
This shows that a student’s economic status is a crucial criteria for determining how much they should pay for tuition.
Although U.S. college tuition fees are among the highest in the world, one third of college students receive scholarships.


The plan would benefit students from households that spend less than 89,700 won a month on national health insurance and less than 200,000 won on annual net property tax.

For instance, Harvard University students don’t have to pay a cent for their tuition if their parents’ annual income is below $60,000.
