The demographic figures suggest the broad population base will start declining in about eight years.
A low birthrate is the primary reason behind the decline.
Korea’s birthrate was 1.22 last year, compared with 4.53 in 1970.
The generation of baby boomers born from 1955 to 1963 is retiring from the work force.
Such a demographic decline has enormous economic and social repercussions.
It depresses productivity and consumer spending, leading to a lethargic economy and weak growth potential.
Welfare and health care subsidies will have to increase to support a larger nonworking population.
The country’s national pension will dry up in the next 50 years.
