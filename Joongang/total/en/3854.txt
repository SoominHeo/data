The GNP’s preparations for its half-priced apartment offer began in spring 2009.
In his Liberation Day speech, President Lee Myung-bak talked about “an epoch-making housing policy for citizens who do not own homes.”
Not long after, the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs announced that it would build housing on sites where the Green Belt restriction was lifted.
In a normal market, half-price products do not exist.
Therefore, administrative authority and tax money, which later became the deficit of the LH Corporation, were mobilized.
The half price deals were only possible when the Green Belt restriction in the pricey Gangnam region was removed.
Finally in spring 2010, apartments became available in Segok-dong in Gangnam District and Naegok-dong in Seocho District.
The apartments were offered at a little over 10 million won per 3.3 square meters through a lottery system.


When a shoe company has a 50 percent off sale, the sale items are the leftovers that have fallen out of fashion or are unpopular designs that will never be sold at the regular price.
