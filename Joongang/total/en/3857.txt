Though our restaurants always boast that they use first-grade local beef, the quality of the beef falls far short of consumers’ expectations.
KAPE classifies Korean beef into five grades: A++, A+, A, B and C. Beef with an “A” grade actually refers to beef in the third tier of the rating system, which goes against consumer expectations that an “A” grade is the best.
Of the Korean beef sold on the market last month, A++ grade beef accounted for only 9.6 percent of the total, followed by A+ (23.3 percent), A (31.1 percent), B (25.1 percent) and C (10.3 percent), which indicates that beef over the A grade accounted for 65 percent of the total sold.
The Korea Consumer Agency and other civic groups have long demanded that this sly practice be stopped while also advocating for a better grading system.
At long last, KAPE has come up with a solution that will be implemented next month.
It will stamp all five grades on the label and a circle will be drawn around the grade of the meat for sale.


The number of Korean cattle increased from 2.6 million in June 2009 to 2.73 million this March.

The price drop was further fueled by an increase in beef imports, which rose 22 percent to 98,277 tons in the first four months this year compared to the same period a year earlier.
