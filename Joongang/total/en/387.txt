Oxy Reckitt Benckiser had assigned SNU and Hoseo University professors for scientific investigation after the Korean Health Authority linked sterilizers used in humidifiers to mysterious deaths and the cause of lung illnesses in August 2011.
The company responded to the accusation, which was based on university reports, by claiming that the causal relation between lung damage and humidifier sterilizers was unclear.
The scientific report is crucial in uncovering the truth behind the manufacturing and sale of deadly sterilizers that caused 143 deaths.
