A working group of 31 scientists from 14 countries meeting at the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that all the available scientific evidence pointed to radiation exposure from cell phone use as “possibly carcinogenic.”
Their study showed that the use of mobile phones for more than 30 minutes per day for 10 years or more raised the rate of brain glioma, a type of tumor, by 40 percent.
