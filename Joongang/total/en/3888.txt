In an audit last year, 19 private universities were penalized for accounting malpractices.
To put these practices to an end, universities must legitimize their financial operations and make public their financial papers to ensure transparency.
Through efficient financial management, they can figure out ways to lower tuition.
Universities also need to restructure their use of reserve funds.
The reserve funds at 149 four-year private universities amounted to 7 trillion won ($6.5 billion) last year.
Of that amount, 46 percent was spent to renovate and build campus facilities, while only 8.6 percent was reserved for student scholarship programs.
