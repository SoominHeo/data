In 49 B.C., the Senate - which represented the interests of conservative aristocrats - felt threatened by Caesarâ€™s remarkable rise and summoned him back to Rome.

He came from the lower class, but with outstanding bravery and military skill, he contributed greatly to driving the Jurchens from the northeast and constructed nine fortresses there during the reign of King Yejong.

All of this reminds me of the recent case of a young prosecutor-turned-auditor who was once a symbol of justice but turned out to have been involved in a corruption case.
