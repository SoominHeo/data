In 1924, two elite young men kidnapped and murdered a boy in Chicago.
The motivation of the criminals, known as Leopold and Loeb, was to commit a “perfect crime.”
It was as if they were trying to prove their intelligence and superiority.
Their story has been the subject of several artistic works, including the film “Rope,” directed by suspense master Alfred Hitchcock and written by Arthur Laurents, the late American playwright who wrote the musical “West Side Story.”
The brutal crime also inspired the musical “Thrill Me: The Leopold and Loeb Story,” which premiered in Korea in 2007.
