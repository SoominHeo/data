Health authorities have released the names of 14 hospitals, dental clinics, Eastern medicine clinics and pharmacies that have doctored their books or counterfeited documents in order to get more funds from public health insurance programs.

It turns out that they overcharged patients and institutions between 15 million won and 200 million won.

As a matter of fact, the NHIC incurred a deficit of more than 1 trillion won last year and has already used up this yearâ€™s reserves of 960 billion won.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare has demanded that the over payments be returned, suspending the operations and licenses of the 14 facilities for between 66 and 184 days.
