The history of the city of Yangzhou goes back 2,500 years.
Originally, Yangzhou was a riverside village with willow trees.
Ancient documents portray Yangzhou as a “city of willows.”
The character for Yang was then changed to a character meaning “hand” instead of “tree” during the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty.
He was the one who ambitiously began construction of a grand canal.
Yangzhou was the south gateway at the Grand Canal that connects the Yellow River in the north and the Chang River in the south.
Maybe the construction project required many hands and that’s why the character was changed.
Yangzhou was also the center of Southern Chinese civilization and the gateway to the world.
During the Tang Dynasty, over 5,000 foreign merchants from Silla, Arabia and Europe lived there.


The first traveler said he wished to become the governor of Yangzhou Province.
