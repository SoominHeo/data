In a nutshell, a strike in a parts supplier with a tiny revenue of around 200 billion won could jeopardize our entire auto industry of 81 trillion won.
For now, there is no other way around letting the Yoosung employees on strike return to work.
If prolonged, the walkout could make the company go bankrupt.
It might face massive lawsuits by local automakers, who would demand compensation worth 1.8 billion won for every hour of loss in manufacturing.


Yoosung Enterprise, which fills 80 percent of the demand for piston rings - a major component of car engines - has stopped production due to a labor protest over wages and a shift system.

In the worst scenario where production grinds to a halt, it could amount to a loss of more than 100 billion won a day and nearly 1 trillion won by the end of the month.
