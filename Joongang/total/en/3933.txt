The four noble families of the Joseon Dynasty were the Kim Sang-heon family of the Andong Kim clan, the Park Se-dang family of the Bannam Park clan, the Lee San-hae family of the Hansan Lee clan, and the Lee Jeong-gu family of the Yeonan Lee clan.

The new award honors families whose members have been teaching students for three generations.

These families have a combined total of 100 years in education.

The three generations of teachers are walking the path of educators together, and they are worthy of the title “Noble Educators” for their dignity and tradition.

According to a survey by the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Associations, up to 80 percent of teachers feel that their satisfaction and morale as teachers have decreased.
