Bernie Madoff, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market, is responsible for the largest Ponzi scheme in history, and in 2008, a U.S. court sentenced him to 150 years in prison.
Madoff’s financial fraud resulted in a $60 billion loss to his clients, and his crime was punished accordingly.

There is no reason why we should not have longer prison terms, of 100 to 200 years, as in the United States.

Economist Gary Becker, who won the Nobel Prize in 1992, calls these “rational crimes.”

Bernie Madoff, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market, is responsible for the largest Ponzi scheme in history, and in 2008, a U.S. court sentenced him to 150 years in prison.

Madoff’s financial fraud resulted in a $60 billion loss to his clients, and his crime was punished accordingly.

If the heaviest sentence, 50 years in prison, were given, financial crimes would decrease.
