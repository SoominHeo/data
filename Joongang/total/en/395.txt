The seventh congress of the North Korean Workers’ Party convenes today in Pyongyang.
In the event, which comes 36 years after the last party congress in October 1980, North Korean officials are expected to announce various measures to consolidate Kim Jong-un’s sole leadership centered around the Communist Party and the political heritage of his father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.
The congress will most likely boast the achievements the North has made in nuclear weapons — one of the two pillars of Kim Jong-un’s double-track policy of nuclear and economic progress which he proclaimed in 2013 when he took power.
They have no other choice but to focus on nuclear development because Kim fell short of achieving economic development in the past five years.

Over the last five years, the North managed to achieve about 1 percent growth in the economy thanks to so-called family farming and an increase in autonomy for businesses.
