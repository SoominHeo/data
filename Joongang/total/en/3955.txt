In the case of Busan Savings Bank, a hotbed of corruption, the auditors of its four subsidiary banks came from the FSS and were involved in providing illegal loans and committing accounting fraud, instead of detecting malpractice by major shareholders.

The new FSS governor, Kwon Hyouk-se, has stressed that he will push ahead with a plan to expand the group of employees who are obliged to report the details of their assets, from the current second-class officials to fourth-class ones.

The FSS should now be prepared to divorce itself from vice once and for all.
