Korea became the second country after the United States to endorse the testing of embryonic stem-cell therapy on people.

The experiment had been devised by a team from the Stem Cell Institute of CHA University’s College of Medicine to treat 12 patients losing their vision from Stargardt’s Macular Dystrophy.

It will be the first case that goes beyond local bioethics law, which limits the use of embryonic stem cells to exterior parts of the human body.
