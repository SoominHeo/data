As international pressure mounted, Italy returned the obelisk in 2005 after 67 years.
The obelisk’s return was made possible by a worldwide campaign urging the return of looted cultural properties sparked by a conflict over the Elgin Marbles.
Considered an artistic masterpiece rivaling the “Mona Lisa,” the Elgin Marbles are a collection of sculptures on the Parthenon.
The earl of Elgin, who was the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, had taken the sculptures to England, and they are now displayed in the British Museum.
The campaign to bring the Elgin Marbles back to Greece has attracted global attention thanks to Greek Culture Minister Melina Mercouri.
Mercouri was an acclaimed actress, and in 1962 she saw the Parthenon Marbles at the British Museum while shooting the film “Phaedra.”


That was over 2,000 years ago.
