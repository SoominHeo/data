LIG Engineering &amp; Construction received an investment-grade rating from agencies, even as it headed to court to apply for receivership on March 21.
Upon winning the investment-grade rating in December last year, the company was able to raise 70 billion won ($64 million) in commercial papers.
Sambu Construction, which recently applied for court receivership, also gained an investment-grade rating in November.
