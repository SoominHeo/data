In Russia, where sweets are popular, some 230 million pies are sold a year.
The pies are also becoming popular in the Middle East.
At a Carrefour store in Tehran, Choco Pie sales are said to amount to 50 million won per month, the biggest amount sold at a single store in the world.
The productâ€™s rising popularity in the market has produced a number of copycat products.
Nestle, a renowned food and nutrition company, manufactures a similar cake that is sold in Moscow.
But Choco Pie still enjoys a dominant position in the global market because consumers have acquired a taste for the original.
The secret behind the original is said to be the extra water that keeps the cake hydrated.
These days, Korean men in their 40s and 50s use it as a substitute for a birthday cake, using match sticks in place of candles.


Chocolate originated with a beverage the Mayans drank 2,600 years ago.

Marshmallows in their present form were first introduced in the late 1800s.
