North Korea may be ready to accept the precondition of inter-Korean dialogue in order to reactivate the six-party talks on denuclearization.

Chinaâ€™s top North Korean envoy, Wu Dawei, told visiting North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, that the six-party talks should resume after North Korea breaks the ice with South Korea and the United States on nuclear issues.

If six-party talks ensue after Seoul-Pyongyang and Washington-Pyongyang dialogue, the topic could move next to food aid.
