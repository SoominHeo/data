Shigeki Toyama wrote in his 1955 book “The History of Sohwa” that the announcement of the war was a bolt out of the blue, even to the Japanese people.
The declaration of war started with the sentence: The Emperor of Japan, who ascended to the imperial throne that is unique in the world, informs you, the brave and faithful subjects, of the following.
But the surprise war declaration completely excluded the Japanese public.
The war took the lives of nearly 5 million Japanese - including 1.14 million army and 440,000 navy soldiers, 1.5 million civilians attached to the military and 1.8 million civilians.

I could not understand why Japan, which had only one-tenth of the economic power of the United States, provoked a war against it.
