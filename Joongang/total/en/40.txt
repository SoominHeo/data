The Korean military has decided to cancel deliveries of KUH-1 Surion transport utility helicopters upon learning of potential defects in its engine as well as other parts.
In a test administered in the United States early this year, the countryâ€™s indigenous twin-engine helicopter failed in 29 out of 101 categories, testing the vehicle flight and operation under freezing weather conditions.
