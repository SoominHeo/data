The first sentence creates the first impression.

That is why so many writers talk about the pain of writing that first sentence.

Prominent literary works often begin with a gripping first sentence.

It begins: “As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.”

A remarkable first line by a literary master also gives inspiration to other authors.
