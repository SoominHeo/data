On April 13, 2008, Hiroshi Komiyama, a former president of Tokyo University, gave a lecture on how to make Japan a great country that can solve the worldâ€™s problems, stressing that a great country always contributes to the progress of history.

He said he saved 80 percent on energy consumption in 2002 by building his house with special insulation materials and solar cells.

Nine years have passed since then, and Japan is now agonizing over problems caused by its nuclear power plants.

But the developing country could never be first rate, just as the student who does their homework after playing cannot beat one who studies first and plays later.

Those who are satisfied with copying will always remain in second place.
