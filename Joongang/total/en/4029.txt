The Japanese Empire had great hopes for the mission and allocated 2 percent of the state budget to the journey.
That is the equivalent to Korea spending 6 trillion won ($5.5 billion) of this year’s 309 trillion won budget.
Korea’s overseas mission was the Sinsa Excursion Group sent to Japan in 1881.


During the 18-month tour, they visited many countries and learned the advanced civilization of Western Europe.

Over 170 years later, Japan dispatched a similar diplomatic mission abroad.

In 1871, Iwakura Tomomi, the foreign minister, led the Iwakura Mission, a team composed of about 50 diplomats that toured 12 countries for 22 months, starting in the United States.
