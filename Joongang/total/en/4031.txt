The title of the film is based on a hypothesis announced in 1971 by American atomic physicist Ralph Lapp, who proposed that if the core of a nuclear reactor in the United States melted, the radioactive material would penetrate the earth and even contaminate China.
The antipode of the U.S. is, of course, not China, but India.
But the phrase “China syndrome” originated from the hypothesis nevertheless.
Later, Lapp’s hypothesis was proven groundless by physicists who concluded that it was not possible for radioactive material to penetrate the earth no matter what the circumstances.
But the idea was not easily erased.
Then, two weeks after the release of “The China Syndrome,” a lethal amount of radioactive material leaked at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.

Are the nuclear reactors in Korea that were built more than 30 years ago safe?
Will the easterly wind that sometimes blows in April bring radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi plant to the Korean Peninsula?


This conundrum is illustrated in the 1979 American film “The China Syndrome,” which tells of the confrontation between the government, which tries to cover up safety problems at a nuclear power plant, and a female journalist who works to uncover the truth.

The title of the film is based on a hypothesis announced in 1971 by American atomic physicist Ralph Lapp, who proposed that if the core of a nuclear reactor in the United States melted, the radioactive material would penetrate the earth and even contaminate China.

Although the content of the essay was proven false when it was published more than 10 years ago, it is redeployed whenever the nuclear issue rises.

Are the nuclear reactors in Korea that were built more than 30 years ago safe?

Will the easterly wind that sometimes blows in April bring radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi plant to the Korean Peninsula?
