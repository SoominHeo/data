In a government-led joint investigation of the sinking, 24 experts sent from the United States, the U.K., Sweden and Australia concurred that the corvette was sunk by a torpedo attack by North Korea.
The international community’s response was no different.
The U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, for example, fully accepted the results of the multinational probe, denouncing the North for its ruthless behavior.
However, the DP rallied to vote against a resolution condemning the North at the National Assembly last June.
In fact, the DP was the ruling party when North Korea waged a sea battle against our patrol ships in the Yellow Sea eight years ago.
We are dumbfounded that a political party with such a history wanted to turn a blind eye to the North’s attack on our warship.
The DP didn’t even bother to investigate the incident on its own.
To the contrary, it argued that the Cheonan struck a coral reef or collided with a U.S. military vessel.
Such a willfully blind attitude reminds us of its lawmakers marching in the front lines of the massive candlelight demonstrations in 2008 against U.S. beef imports.
