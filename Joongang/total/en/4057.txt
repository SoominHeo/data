The Cheonan sinking has raised our alertness to the highest level since the Korean War.
Those skeptical of the South-led multinational investigation that blamed Pyongyang for the attack were silenced when North Korea bombarded Yeonpyeong Island in November.

At the same time, however, we must not forget that the North is apart of us and we will embrace each other one day.
