The South Korean military came under fire for hastiness when they repatriated 22 North Koreans a day after they were discovered in southern waters in a rubber boat in February 2008.
Since 2000, North Korea has returned all South Korean fishermen it captured on the East Sea.


Pyongyang posted propaganda interviews with the family of the four online and accused South Korea of brainwashing the four.

Then suddenly earlier this month it said four wanted to defect, claiming that they changed their mind at the last minute.
