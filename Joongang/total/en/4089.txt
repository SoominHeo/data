Starbucks was the company that in the 1980s introduced Italian-style coffee to Americans, who were accustomed to drinking drip coffee.
It took its business model from Italian cafes.
Not all coffee is the same.
Like wine, the price and taste of coffee vary greatly depending on the area where it is produced.
There are two major species of coffee - Arabica, which makes up about 75 percent of total global output, and Robusta, which is lower in grade than Arabica but has more caffeine.
They are priced according to quality: Jamaican Blue Mountain, Hawaiian Kona, Colombian Mild, non-Colombian (such as Guatemalan, Yemeni and Ethiopian), Mild Arabica, Brazilian Arabica and Robusta from Java.
Blue Mountain coffee, the production of which is only about 1 percent of the total output, is rare and much more expensive than other varieties.
