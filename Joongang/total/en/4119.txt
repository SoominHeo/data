Last October, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared in a video for the “It Gets Better” project, aimed at giving hope to young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.

The project was launched after the death of Ashe Brown, a 13-year-old who shot himself, and Taylor Clementi, an 18-year-old who jumped off a bridge.

It is said that a person knows he or she is gay between the ages of 10 and 18.

Ten of the 12 attackers are in middle school.
