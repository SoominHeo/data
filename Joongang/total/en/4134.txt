That afternoon, KICE announced that the average score had actually dropped by two to three points from the previous year.
It was a tragic result.
The basis of the controversy over the CSAT is its inconsistency with the level of difficulty.
We often say it is either a “fiery” CSAT or a “watery” one.
The 2002 CSAT was a fiery one.
Compared to the year before, the average score was 66.5 points lower, which was the largest margin of decline in its history.

The average score went up by 27.6 points, and 66 people got perfect scores.

Since the 2001 CSAT failed to differentiate students in different levels, even a student with a perfect score did not qualify for the special admissions round at Seoul National University.
