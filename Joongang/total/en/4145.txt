The Cheonan naval ship was the victim of a thoroughly organized attack by North Korea in March last year.
Yet the South Korean military failed to learn and change after that incident, allowing a much more significant attack on Yeonpyeong that led to civilian deaths.
In January of last year, North Korea fired 400 artillery shells toward the southern waters of the disputed maritime border of the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea.
