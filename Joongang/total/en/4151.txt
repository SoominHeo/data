He wrote that young Koreans need to remind themselves that they are not in a concentration camp in North Korea because many young Americans fought in the “forgotten war” in 1950.
As he said, we cannot deny America’s influence, both positive and negative, on Korea’s emergence from the devastation of the war.
Rumsfeld certainly had a point here.
But human memory has its limits.
According to the “forgetting curve” by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a person will remember only 50 percent of what he saw and learned within one hour.
He will forget about 80 percent after a month, and the other 20 percent will remain vaguely in one corner of the brain.
When we use the 20 percent of our past as a lesson, we make progress.
