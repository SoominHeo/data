The European Union adopted an emissions trading system in 2005, capping emissions levels and allowing companies that don’t hit the limit to sell the rights to whatever they don’t use.
The United States and Japan, however, are dragging their feet on the issue as their economies slowly recover, despite being aggressive in this area in the past.
In a cabinet meeting on Dec. 28, the Japanese government decided to postpone an emissions trading plan - which was initially scheduled to go into effect this year - for an indefinite period.
Democrats in the United States also seem to have put the issue on the back burner after losing to corporate-friendly Republicans in the mid-term elections in November.
