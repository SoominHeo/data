The city of Yubari - located on the island of Hokkaido in Japan - went bankrupt in 2007.
It became saddled with huge debts after sponsoring an international film festival and investing heavily in projects to build museums and a massive amusement park.
The moves were part of a larger plan to turn the ailing coal mining town into a tourist destination.
As part of its cost-cutting efforts, half of the city’s public workers were sacked and the rest were forced to take wage cuts.
An elementary school student wrote a message that said he wished a rich person who would come in and save the town.
Unfortunately, many cities across Korea could share the same fate as Yubari.
Take Taebaek in Gangwon Province, for example.
The city spent 200 billion won ($180 million) to build a theme park, but it’s now questionable whether it will even open at all due to doubts about its ability to generate profits.
There are four other amusement parks and museums in this mountainous city with grim prospects as well, which could put Taebaek in a precarious position.
