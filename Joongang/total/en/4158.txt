The only new discovery that came to light during the interrogations is that Seok Hae-kyun, the captain of the freighter, was hit by bullets fired not only from Somali pirates but also one from the Korean rescue squad as well.
The central focus of the investigation is to discover who actually ordered the hijacking, but it has not cleared up this issue.
Authorities have also yet to find any connection between the attack on the Samho Jewelry and the earlier hijackings of the Samho Dream supertanker and the Geummi 305 trawler.
