A more serious problem is there is a possibility that more of these incidents will be uncovered because the Seoul education office is rolling up its sleeves to inspect another 20 schools that have frequently corrected students’ records.
High schools and teachers may be tempted to edit their students’ performance to make it easier for them to get into good colleges.
If a student once said he wanted to be a prosecutor, and the teacher changes that to banker on his record, maybe that’s not so serious, especially if the student changed his mind after a year or two.


It’s terribly regrettable - and shocking - that some private high schools have manipulated their students’ three-year records to their advantage during the college admission season.

The Seoul education office has requested the school in question punish 17 teachers - including the principal - involved in the scam.
