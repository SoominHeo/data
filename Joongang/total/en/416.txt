As the KCCI claims, taking another day off in May could trigger a bigger economic effect than on a hot and humid day in August.
The government estimates that its decision to designate last August 14 as a special holiday sparked demand worth 1.31 trillion won ($1.14 billion) after the economy suffered from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak.
The measure led to soaring revenues, albeit temporarily, in the tourism, accommodation, restaurant, retail and transportation sectors, the government says.
 But the government must avoid overly abrupt decisions.
As happened last August, local companies are not prepared.
Some 30 percent to 40 percent of all businesses cannot take such a hurried holiday off because it will cost them money.
