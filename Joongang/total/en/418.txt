Mun, who had habitually abused Jo verbally and physically during their 20 years of marriage, acted no differently that day.

At the initial trial, all nine members of the jury found her guilty and did not accept her self-defense plea, arguing that Mun was no longer violent once he fell to the floor and that murder is not the only way to resolve domestic violence.

Still, the court upheld the two-year sentence, explaining that her crime still merited punishment because she was responsible for the loss of a precious life.

Since the 1990s, many womenâ€™s rights advocates and academics have continuously argued that self-defense or an act of necessity must be recognized as valid defense when the victim of domestic violence murders a spouse.

The perspective of the nine jurors who convicted her is the reality, but we must expand our awareness of the psychological status of a domestic violence victim.
