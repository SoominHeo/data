The report was drawn up by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources after three years of study from 2009 to 2012 and handed to fire department authorities for reference.
What is shocking is that the fault zones overlap with Koreaâ€™s nuclear reactors.
Eight reactors sit near the Ilgwang fault, and two additions under construction in the Gori complex are just 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.
The Wolseong complex, which houses six reactors, is not far from the Ulsan fault.
