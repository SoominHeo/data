Ishihara, who used to be the champion of Tanaka critics, wrote a nonfiction book about Tanaka’s life from a first-person perspective.
In 1974, Ishihara wrote a contribution to Bungei Shunju, a popular literary magazine, to criticize Tanaka’s plutocracy, creating an opportunity for his resignation.
And yet, Ishihara shed new light on Tanaka by depicting him as a genius and a patriot.
Ishihara paid particular attention to Tanaka’s foresight.
He sponsored 33 bills as a lawmaker, mostly on improving infrastructure and developing the country.


Since last year, 13 books on him have been published.
