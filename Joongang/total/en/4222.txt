Today, some 400 spotted Hanwoo cows are being raised on Ulleung Island in the East Sea.

American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead wrote that the French and English have 35 different cuts of beef, the Bodi tribe in Africa has 51 cuts, while the Koreans have a staggering 120 different cuts.

Now, the countryâ€™s cows are suffering from foot-and-mouth disease, which has spread to farms of six leading Hanwoo brands in Gangwon.
