Therefore, Zeus extended the lifespan of humans to 70 years by taking 18 years away from donkeys, 12 years from dogs and 10 years from monkeys.
The 18 years borrowed from the donkey, the fables say, represent the period when humans should work hard to contribute to society, while the 12 years from the dog are when they should support their families.

Buddha left the comfort of his palace at 30, and Confucius said 30 was the age when men can stand up firm and steady.
The broadcasting arm of the JoongAng Media Network, jTBC, received the highest ranking of the four candidates awarded licenses to operate new general programming channels.

For a paper that has been barred from broadcasting for the past 30 years, the license to broadcast signifies more than just three lost decades: itâ€™s a time to celebrate the return of long-absent guests.

The 18 years borrowed from the donkey, the fables say, represent the period when humans should work hard to contribute to society, while the 12 years from the dog are when they should support their families.

First, pleasure dominates the first 30 years of life because humans are free from responsibility, but agony and hard work are sure to follow.

The relationship between maturity and 30 years appears to be similar in almost all civilizations.

Buddha left the comfort of his palace at 30, and Confucius said 30 was the age when men can stand up firm and steady.

With the awarding of the license, the Tongyang Broadcasting Company, which was closed by the military government in 1980, has the chance to resume broadcasting after 30 years.
