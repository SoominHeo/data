On Nov. 23, a livestock farmer in Andong, North Gyeongsang, reported possible symptoms of the disease among his cows.

By that time, however, 15 cows from the farms where FMD was confirmed had already been moved to other parts of the country.

That regulation was added after most of the cattle that tested negative in examinations in January and April turned out to be positive for the disease after a more detailed test later on.

FMD has already hit the country three times in this year alone.

Now we have no other choice but inoculation, which makes it more difficult for us to regain our FMD-free status once the disease is eradicated.
