Born Sayaga, he arrived in Joseon in April 1592 and defected immediately because he did not want to kill the innocent people of Joseon and had always revered the culture and civilization of Joseon and China.
Kim served in the Joseon army, driving away Japanese forces, and taught Joseon soldiers how to use guns and explosives.
The Joseon government recognized his merits and gave him the title of general.
He was also given the family name Kim.
After the Imjin War ended, Kim continued to serve in the military.
He also participated in the Second Manchu invasion of Korea in 1627 and was posted in the frontier until he retired.
Kim had devoted his body and soul to his chosen home.
He also married a Joseon woman and settled down in Urok-dong near Daegu.
During the Japanese colonial era in the 20th century, Japanese officials and scholars tried to deny Kim’s existence.
Some scholars visited Urok-dong and personally investigated the records handed down in the Kim family.
However, they did not recognize him as Japanese.
Rather, they considered him “half Korean and half Japanese” or just a fictional figure.
In 1930, Hidetaka Nakamura of the Japanese colonial government’s Korean History Compilation Committee conducted an investigation and confirmed that Kim Chung-seon was indeed a Japanese defector.
