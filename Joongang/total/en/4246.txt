A few years ago, the Wall Street Journal surveyed 19,000 men and women in 20 European countries, and the poll showed that the Italians are the best lovers in Europe.
The women had higher expectations for Italian men over those from their countries.
They preferred the Italian men and their lifestyle of “dolce far niente,” or “sweet doing nothing.”
An ancient Roman saying goes, “You don’t count the age, the number of lovers and wine.”
However, even if you take into account the distinctive Italian culture, 74-year-old Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a mysterious figure.
