The governments of South Korea, the United States and Japan believe that six-party talks can start only when North Korea is willing to seek denuclearization, take responsibility for the Cheonan sinking, and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island.
Thatâ€™s the right way to go and a majority of South Koreans also support it.
The West had supported the six-party talks in order to change North Korea through dialogue and engagement.
