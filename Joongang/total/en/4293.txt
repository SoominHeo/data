Cho Chang-ho, the first South Korean prisoner of war in the North to defect back to the South, who passed away in 2006, was known as the “fallen soldier who returned.”

At the age of 64, Cho risked his life to defect from the North by crossing the Yalu River in a dugout canoe.

Scenes of him saluting the defense minister touched hearts nationwide as Cho said, “Second Lieutenant Cho Chang-ho of the artillery unit, military service number 212966, reports his safe return.”

Since then, more than 70 South Korean POWs have escaped the North to live here.

A few days ago, four South Korean POWs met their families at a reunion.

But about 500 South Korean POWs are reportedly still there.
