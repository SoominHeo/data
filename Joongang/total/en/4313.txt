The difference in reading culture between Korea and Japan, which has already produced two Nobel laureates, is noticeable at bookstores.
“1Q84,” written by Murakami Haruki, who was also mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize this year, sold 4 million copies in Japan and more than 1 million copies in Korea.
Korea’s book market ranks 10th in the world in size, but the portion of literary works is only 2.8 percent.


Although Tolstoy was said to be the strongest candidate for the first Nobel Prize for Literature in 1901, the prize instead went to Sully Prudhomme, a French poet.

The 1958 literature prize was given to Boris Leonidovich Pasternak, the author of “Doctor Zhivago,” which criticized the reality of living under socialism.
