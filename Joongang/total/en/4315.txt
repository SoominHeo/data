In Iraq, the cluster bombs were dropped from an altitude of 30,000 feet so that many of the small bombs could detect and destroy Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles.
However, the weapon that has attracted the most attention is the E-bomb.
It destroys electronic equipment with an electromagnetic radiation pulse (EMP).
It does not aim to kill or wound humans or destroy enemy forces.
It is a concept bomb that aims to disrupt communication systems and the enemy’s chain of command.
An EMP can infiltrate wherever there is a conductor, such as an antenna, ventilator or water pipe.
The EMP concept was introduced in “The Matrix” series of films as the most powerful weapon available.
