On one side, Jeong Jae-seung, a professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Kaist), posted a Tweet saying: “Consuming cheap pizza, ‘which consumers do not need and can do without’ at E-mart is not reasonable.”
On the other side, Chung Yong-jin, vice chairman of Shinsegae Group retorted, “It’s a consumer’s instinct to want to enjoy cheap and good food,” adding “they try to color consumption with ideology.”
It is difficult to say which side is right, but there is one thing Chung failed to note.

McKinsey and Company, a global management consulting firm, recommended people purchase products considering the social reputation of companies in 2007.
