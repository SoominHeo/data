Four of the orphanages were exclusively for girls.
One of them was Ospedale della Pieta, a convent, orphanage and music school.

The center provides free music education to select children from low income and multiethnic families.
The program is modeled after El Sistema, a music education program for young people from poor families founded in Venezuela.
El Sistema started with 11 children at a garage in the slums in Caracas in 1975 and has since grown to include 125 youth orchestras under its umbrella.
In the course of its 35-year history, more than 300,000 young people have learned music through El Sistema.
The program is credited with helping young people find their lifeâ€™s goal through music and delivering them from violence and crime.
The founder of El Sistema, Jose Antonio Abreu, was recently selected as the winner of the 10th Seoul Peace Prize.
His theory - that music is the most effective preventative against drugs, prostitution and other social vices in the lives of children - still makes my heart flutter.
The news that 24 percent of students at primary, middle and high schools in Korea are in a situation in which they are exposed to the dangers of drinking, gambling and depression, is extremely troubling.
Now more than ever we need to expand the Korean version of El Sistema, as found in the Sejong Youth Harmony Orchestra.


One of them was Ospedale della Pieta, a convent, orphanage and music school.

About one third of the girls who grew up there became highly accomplished musicians.

What the two institutions have in common is their commitment to nurturing unfortunate youths through music.
