The sport was introduced to Korea by the crew of the British Royal Navy ship Flying Horse, which landed at Incheon port in 1882, during the 19th year of King Gojong’s reign.
Sixty-seven years later, in 1949, the first women’s football match was held in Seoul with the participation of three middle school girls’ teams - Muhak, Jungang and Myeongseong.
Although there weren’t many complaints about women playing either volleyball or basketball, there was such a strong reaction to girls playing football that the match was only played after much delay.
Perhaps it was for that reason that women’s football disappeared again until after the Korean War.
In this rapidly changing world, however, Korean women’s football cannot be ignored.
In 1985, the Korea Football Association inaugurated the Korean women’s football team.
Girls’ football teams and professional women’s football teams sprang up one by one as if they had just woken up from 36 years of sleep.
Later on, the Korea Women’s Football League failed to attract public attention and didn’t have much support - but that wasn’t the end of the story.
In 2002, the Korea-Japan World Cup and “Bend It Like Beckham,” a film about a young woman whose dream is to play football, were great catalysts that showed once and for all that football was not the exclusive property of men.
Korean women players also gained inspiration from the FA Women’s Premier League in England, Women’s Football Bundesliga in Germany and Women’s Professional Soccer in the United States.
It’s been said that Koreans have football in their DNA.
During the Silla Dynasty, Koreans played chukguk, a game similar to football.
Gomujullori also requires delicate footwork.
Recently, the Korean women’s football team won the U-17 World Cup title.
