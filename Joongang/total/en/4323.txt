The 17 elements are scandium, yttrium and the fifteen lanthanides.
The name “Lanthanum” comes from the Greek “lanthanon,” meaning “I am hidden.”
Dysprosium, which also belongs to lanthanide category, means “hard to get” in Greek.
These rare materials are key materials in high-tech industries such as semiconductors and electric automobiles and are indispensible to green industries.
The most notable of Japan’s eco-friendly high-tech products is the Prius, a hybrid electric car by Toyota.
Each electric motor in the Prius requires 0.9 to 1.8 kilograms of neodymium, a rare earth element whose name means “new twins” in Greek.

Until mid-2000, rare earth metals were traded at a reasonable price, but as the Chinese government began to control the trade, the price has skyrocketed.
Terbium, which is used to bake lasers and fluorescent lamps, are traded for over $300 per kilogram.


Each electric motor in the Prius requires 0.9 to 1.8 kilograms of neodymium, a rare earth element whose name means “new twins” in Greek.

Seventy percent of the rare earth elements reserves are concentrated in China, which produces 97 percent of the world’s rare earth element supply.

Until mid-2000, rare earth metals were traded at a reasonable price, but as the Chinese government began to control the trade, the price has skyrocketed.

As if predicting the rise in demand for rare earth metals, Deng Xiaoping said in 1992: “There is oil in the Middle East, but there is rare earth in China.”

As of the end of August, the rare earth elements reserve in the Korea Resources Corporation is 3 tons, only 0.3 percent of the target volume.
