In Korea, our ancestors used four standards to measure a person’s character: the body, speech, writing and judgment.
But there was a time when one’s political leanings were expressed through clothing.
In the late-Joseon period (1392-1910), when factional confrontation was at its height, politicians and officials of different political factions wore different clothing styles.
One example of this was the bokgeon, a headpiece worn by male politicians.
During the reign of King Jeongjo, the members of the Seoin faction wore bokgeon while the members of Namin faction did not.
This enraged the king, who asked how they could have different attire when they served in the same court.
In the end, the Namin were pressured to wear bokgeon to follow the custom of the Seoin, which was the norm at the time.
It was just one instance in which attire was a symbol of power.
Recently, Foreign Policy magazine analyzed the fashion of 10 dictators around the world.
