June is the cruelest month - for fruit, that is.
After they endure the low temperatures of the winter, with some barely escaping, it is time for them to compete for water and nutrients.
Those that lose the competition fall from the trees in a phenomenon known as the “June drop.”
Poet Byeon Hak-gyu wrote of the June drop: “Just like the wandering mountain birds, they cry out and spit blood.”

Every autumn, the country is hit by a series of typhoons.
As Typhoon Kompasu swept the country, it left a trail of uprooted trees and fallen fruits in its wake.
And our repulsively long rainy spell has forced the last remaining fruits from their branches.
All of this is the result of climate change brought about by global warming.
If this continues, we should start calling it what it is - the September Drop.
Yet we shouldn’t be discouraged.


Poet Byeon Hak-gyu wrote of the June drop: “Just like the wandering mountain birds, they cry out and spit blood.”

And the summer was the second hottest ever, with average temps of 24.8 degrees Celsius.
