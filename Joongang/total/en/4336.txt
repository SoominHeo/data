The plague that killed roughly a quarter of Europe’s population in the 14th century was the result of bacteria.
But the medical effects of penicillin, which was once called a “miracle drug,” did not last long.
New germs that destroy and neutralize the molecular structure of penicillin soon appeared.
According to medical experts, about 50 percent of staphylococcus bacteria acquired a tolerance to penicillin by the 1940s.
That means penicillin surrendered to the counterattack of germs less than 10 years after its introduction.

And last month, health officials across the world issued warnings about the spread of a new bacteria called NDM-1.
The appearance of super bacteria is in part the result of the abuse of antibiotics.


That means penicillin surrendered to the counterattack of germs less than 10 years after its introduction.

In 2005, AIDS claimed the lives of 12,500 people in the United States, while the death toll from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus hit 18,650.

There are reports that four people died in Korea two years ago from the same germ.
