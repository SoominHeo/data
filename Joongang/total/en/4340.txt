As recounted in “Filthy Lucre: Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism” by Joseph Heath, in the early 1990s, cosmetics maker The Body Shop paid more than the market price when purchasing shea butter produced in Ghana.
The purchase was a part of an initiative called “Trade Not Aid,” a fair trade campaign promoted by the cosmetics company.
The goal was to help eradicate poverty by urging consumers in developed countries to pay generous prices for goods imported from underdeveloped countries.
But the aftermath of all that good will was devastating.
African farmers were swept away by the shea butter craze, and production volume increased 10 times, from two tons to 20 tons in just a year.
Shea butter production was four times higher than the initial order from The Body Shop.

That will temper the fire for now, but it cannot serve as a lasting solution.
Each citizen consumes less than one sack of rice per year, but our stores of rice are piling up by the year.
Fortunately, coffee prices are now on the rise, as consumption is growing in China and India and production has decreased due to changes in climate.


Shea butter production was four times higher than the initial order from The Body Shop.

The movement gained momentum in the early 2000s when coffee prices plummeted from $3 per pound to less than 50 cents.

Meanwhile, in Korea, in order to prevent rice prices from collapsing this fall, the Korean government is about to purchase the surplus of 1.14 million tons of newly harvested rice.
