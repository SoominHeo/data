Many people are calling it a miracle, yet the ultimate fate of the miners is not yet known: Rescuers say it could take four months to get the men out, an extraordinarily long time to remain underground.
Although rescuers are able to communicate and provide essentials such as food through small holes they drilled to the site, the key question is whether the men can endure extremely hot temperatures for so long in such damp and dark confines.
In an extreme situation like this, no one knows how they will cope.
Psychologists say it is essential that the men maintain mental stability and have a sense of humor.
Keeping a positive attitude, these professionals say, is just as important as eating and drinking when it comes to survival in this scenario.
These men are more fortunate than other cave-in victims in the third world countries, where mining accidents occur often and deaths are common.


Hollywood even produced a film based on the story called “Alive” in 1993.
