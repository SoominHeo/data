318 of Japan, which was signed on Aug. 29, 1910, had just one main provision: “The title of the Daehan Empire has changed.
From now on, it is to be called Joseon.”
With this, the sovereignty of the Daehan (Korean) Empire (1897-1910) was handed over to the Japanese emperor.
Korea in effect fell under the rule of Japan, though it was not technically a Japanese territory - just as Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom was also the ruler of India.
The Japanese cabinet therefore could not intervene in the colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
Instead, the Joseon governor-general, who was appointed by the Japanese emperor, exercised full authority over the legislative, judicial and administrative branches of the Korean government.
During the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese preferred to use the word “Han” as the geographical name of Korea rather than Joseon - similar to how Koreans preferred to use “Woe,” the geographical name of Japan, rather than the country’s official name.
The Japanese militarists in the 1870s adopted a philosophy of conquest called “Jeong-han-ron.”
