Ford estimated that the explosions of the fuel tanks would result in 180 deaths and 180 burn victims, and calculated that each death would cost $200,000 to settle, and each injury $67,000.
Adding up the liability to compensate for damage to the cars, Ford estimated that it would cost $49.5 million to settle lawsuits from the defect, while installing safety devices to fix it on every Pinto produced would cost $137.5 million.
