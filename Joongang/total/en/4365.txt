Since its inception in 1961, the ROTC has been off-limits to women.
This restriction is about to be broken.
The Ministry of Defense has reportedly decided to admit 60 female ROTC cadets on a trial base in the second half of this year.
Still, some have criticized the decision.
The slogan at the Sangmudae camp, where some ROTC cadets undergo their four months of training, is “follow me.”


They have three characteristics - a high regard for school, hometown and family.

There is one thing they swear 

And there is just one thing they don’t have: women.
