After shooting for four months without the heroine, Selznick chose English actress Vivien Leigh for the role.
The public reacted strongly against his selection.
They reasoned that it made no sense to have an English actress playing a heroine who embodied the “spirit of the South,” but Selznick did not budge.
When the audience finally watched the film, however, they spared no praise.
Produced in 1939, Gone with the Wind is still regarded as a great movie that no one dare remake.
