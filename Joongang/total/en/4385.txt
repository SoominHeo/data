In the United States, 11 million jobs have disappeared since 2007, and two-thirds of them had been occupied by men.

One idea is that the financial and construction sectors are directly affected by the crisis while the health care and education sectors, which traditionally employ more women, are not sensitive to the market.

Another theory is that the average wage for men is higher than that for women, so higher-paid workers are always first to go.

One of the major reasons for this is that four out of 10 employed women here are temporary workers while just 2.4 out of 10 men are.
