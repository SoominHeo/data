Ways to fight heat can be found in nature, in the four basic elements of wind, earth, water and fire.

One can retreat into the water, wading or washing one’s hair.

One can also fight fire with fire, eating kimchijjigae stew or visiting a sauna.

There is another element that can fight heat: Love, just like in the movie “The Fifth Element.”
