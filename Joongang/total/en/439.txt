Until 2013, New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport was notorious for its long wait times at immigration.
Whenever the media raised the issue, U.S. Customs and Border Protection always argued that it could not be helped since international arrivals were increasing every year, and JFK was the busiest airport with the most foreign visitors in the United States.
So I was pleasantly surprised when I visited New York last week after three years to attend the International News Media Association conference.

Last year, the average entry time was 29 minutes, but foreigners’ experiences were different.
