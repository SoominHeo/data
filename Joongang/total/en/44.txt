Currently, our criminal law provides that anyone who brought about damage to his or her company by taking financial benefits or allowing a third party to do so can be punished for breach of trust.
As the charge is so broadly defined and abstract, our courts have historically even given different verdicts at first, second and third trials in cases involving the same charge.
