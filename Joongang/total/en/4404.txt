FIFA’s approval of the qualification of Alfredo di Stefano - a star player on Real Madrid - as a member of the Spanish national team in 1956 created a big stir in the football world.
Only three years before, FIFA had ruled that di Stefano, who once played for the Argentine national team, could not switch his nationality to Colombia to be part of the Colombian national team at the 1954 FIFA World Cup.
Critics questioned whether FIFA had changed its position for the sake of sales, because di Stefano had become the world’s top scorer since acquiring Spanish citizenship.
Unfortunately, Spain failed to qualify for the 1958 World Cup finals.
In 1962, di Stefano helped Spain qualify for the World Cup, but a muscle injury before the tournament prevented him from playing.
Di Stefano, one of the greatest players of all time, played with three different national teams during his career.
Yet he failed to appear in the finals even once.

There are many players who have to choose between two nationalities due to their personal background.

Jong, who is a third-generation Korean resident of Japan, plays for the North Korean team even though he holds a South Korean passport.
