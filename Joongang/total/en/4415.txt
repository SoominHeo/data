The idea that Chunhyang, the daughter of a gisaeng courtesan, could be the lawful wife of a royal emissary who won first place in a state examination - in a society with a rigid caste system - is somewhat outrageous.

Chunhyang, out of indignation, commits suicide, and her vengeful spirit kills the newly-appointed magistrates of Namwon one after another.

In addition to The Servant, which is a hit at the box office, the recently-ended KBS-2 drama “Cinderella’s Elder Sister,” achieved great success by replacing the heroine with the stepmother’s daughter.
