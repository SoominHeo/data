The lives of part-time lecturers started to crumble in 1977, when they were deprived of the status of “teaching staff” following a policy on financial stabilization of educational institutes.
In addition to receiving poor pay, part-time lecturers have no job security.
According to the Irregular Worker Protection Law, which was enacted in July 2007, a “part-time lecturer” is not part of the list of jobs that should be switched to permanent positions after two years of employment because they are regarded as a special group.
According to the part-time lecturers’ union, six part-time lecturers have committed suicide since 2000, accusing universities of corruption in the employment of teaching staff and flaws in their employment system.
