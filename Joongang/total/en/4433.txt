A man in his 40s with an Afro was walking along 14th street in Manhattan.
A police patrol stopped abruptly pulled over beside him and three officers jumped out to arrest him.
They claimed he looked like a suspected rapist wanted by the police and showed the man a police sketch of the suspect.
The middle-aged man was shocked by the drawing.
The culprit was much taller and heavier than him and seemed to be about 15 years younger.
The only thing that they had in common was their haircut.
After arguing with the police for 20 minutes, the police admitted that they were mistaken and released him.
