They rule the country by dividing state affairs into nine parts.
When a state guest, whoever it may be, visits China, usually just a few of the Politburo Standing Committee members go out to meet them.
The one state head that gets to meet all nine committee members is Kim Jong-il, the chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea and the head of the country’s Workers’ Party.
This unprecedented treatment is due to the special relationship between the two countries.
