At 2 p.m. on Oct. 1, 1949, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai arrived at the parking lot behind Tiananmen Square one by one.
Vehicles carrying Soong Ching-ling, Lee Jisen and Guo Merlu were the next to arrive.
All were there to attend the ceremony of the foundation of the People’s Republic of China.
All passed through the gate without being checked.
Other participants were only allowed to enter the gate after exhibiting their passes.
At 3 p.m. the same day, a woman tried to enter the gate that led to the balcony of the Working People’s Cultural Palace.

In March 1927, the second popular uprising initiated by the Communist Party in Shanghai failed.

By 1957, the situation in China was still chaotic after the nation’s founding but Soong met with Vice President Liu Shaoqi and told him she still wanted membership.

Park Se-ri, Ji Hyeon-ok (the first Korean woman to summit Everest), Kim Yu-na and Lee Sang-hwa are just a few.

She achieved the incredible by conquering the 14 highest peaks in the world.
