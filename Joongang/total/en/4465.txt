In the Small-sum Civil Suit Act revised in 1990, there is a provision that stipulates open court sessions can be held during holidays and evening hours.
But the provision has been ignored for almost 20 years.


In Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, they operate evening courts that open after office hours, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.

In the new system, civil trials will begin at 7 p.m., the time most offices close.
