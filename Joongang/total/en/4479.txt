Some 300 years ago, the Netherlands was the dominant player on the worldâ€™s trade stage.

The Dutch East India Company, which was one of the first joint stock companies in the world, imported spice, silk, porcelain and gold from the East.

The country of 1.5 million became a great power thanks to adventurous spirits who took to the sea and the constant pursuit of innovation.
