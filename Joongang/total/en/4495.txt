Former U.S. President Richard Nixon pointed out the harshness of politics by saying, “Finishing second in the Olympics gets you silver.
Finishing second in politics gets you oblivion.”


The marathon gold medal favorite at the 1936 Berlin Olympics was Juan Carlos Zabala of Argentina.

At that moment, British marathoner Ernest Harper, running in the second group, gave Sohn precious advice: “He will get tired soon.

Sure enough, Zabala, who ran more quickly than usual, gave up the race when others overtook him at 28 kilometers.

So the position of the front-runner, who has to keep those behind in check, is a difficult one.

Second and third are no substitutes.

Finishing second in politics gets you oblivion.”

Psychologist William James described the feeling of a second-place winner who, despite almost being the best in the world, agonizes desperately over not being first as a paradox.

To us, now, all of you who won the hard struggle against yourselves are first-place winners and gold medalists.
