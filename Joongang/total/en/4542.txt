Around eight tons of calcium chloride had been sprayed there each year to melt snow, and apparently it rapidly corroded the bridgeâ€™s joints.
Around 100 ginkgo trees along Tongil-ro also turned brown because of calcium chloride, which sucked up their nutrients and moisture and increased the salinity of the soil.


The real star of the heaviest snowfall in a century is calcium chloride, a chemical that absorbs 14 times its weight in moisture.

Though it may melt snow, calcium chloride is also 1.3 times more corrosive than salt.

Around 100 ginkgo trees along Tongil-ro also turned brown because of calcium chloride, which sucked up their nutrients and moisture and increased the salinity of the soil.

You just have to shovel it off to one side and wait for the sun to melt it.

There is just one month left until the first day of spring.
