The Japanese occupiers held the then-cutting-edge industrial exhibition under the pretext of publicizing the benefits of colonial rule at home and abroad, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Japanese annexation of Korea.
They had already decided to construct a new building for the governor-general in front of Gyeongbok Palace, after due consideration of the symbolic and cultural meaning attached to the heart of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).
Many buildings at the palace were demolished to make way for the exhibition, with provisional buildings erected instead on some of the sites.
Gyeongbok Palace itself was converted into an exhibition hall.
After the 50-day exhibition ended, only the hall showcasing works of art was renovated into a museum, with the remaining provisional buildings all demolished.

On the site where the buildings once stood, the occupiers planted grass with a sign that read, “Grass.”
