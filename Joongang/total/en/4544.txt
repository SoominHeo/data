Exactly 99 years after that, in August 1997, Princess Diana was killed in a car accident that occurred while her driver was trying to outmaneuver the paparazzi.
Paparazzi - who originated from photographers who took photos of the dead that should not be made public - had now committed the tragedy of driving the living to death.
The meaning of paparazzi is an annoying noise, particularly that of a buzzing mosquito.
It is said that the word originated from a photographer, who chased upper-class women, featured in the 1960 film “La Dolce Vita” directed by Federico Fellini.
