Buildings in the range of 100 to 199 meters high are called the “high-rises,” those in the range of 200 to 299 meters are known as “skyscrapers” and those over 300 meters are “supertalls.”
The enforcement ordinance of Korea’s building code defines “super-high” structures as “buildings that are over 50 stories or over 200 meters in height.”
