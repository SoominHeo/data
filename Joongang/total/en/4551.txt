South Korea, which imported related technologies from France until some 20 years ago, has grown up to win the contract over France.
In the world of nuclear energy, however, 20 years is an eternity.


The 1980s was the ice age for the nuclear power industry.

At that time, Westinghouse of the United States and Framatome of France competed to win contracts for the construction of Koreaâ€™s Uljin-1 and Uljin-2 reactors.

As is seen in the competition to win a contract for a nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates, three countries that succeeded in developing third-generation nuclear reactors - South Korea, France and Japan - are competing fiercely in a newly emerging market of nuclear power industry.
