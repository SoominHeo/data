As the antinuclear power movement, which lasted about 30 years, has subsided, nuclear power plants came into the spotlight again as a source of clean energy that is safe and does not produce greenhouse gases.
Now, France, Japan and Korea have emerged as leading contenders in the market for nuclear power plant construction, which will eventually grow to trillions of dollars.
At last, Korea became an exporter of nuclear power plants by winning one of the world’s biggest nuclear energy contracts, a project for the construction of nuclear power plants for the United Arab Emirates.
This is the valuable fruit of Korea’s 50-year effort to develop nuclear energy technology, including the sacrifices of the local residents who spent their careers working in nuclear power plants, the sweat of scientists and the dream of former presidents.


South Korea has also constructed nuclear power plants one after another without hesitation.

Exactly 50 years ago, President Rhee established the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute there.
