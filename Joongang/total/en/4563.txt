In the winter of 1930, when Korea was under Japanese rule, the mood in Gongju was almost ready to boil over.

The residents of Gongju raised funds to stage a campaign against the moving of the provincial office, and in January the following year, they staged a rally in front of the official residence of the provincial governor.

Behind the campaign against Gongju was Kim Gap-sun (1872-1960), the richest man in the South Chungcheong city.

In 1932, the provincial office was moved to Daejeon.
