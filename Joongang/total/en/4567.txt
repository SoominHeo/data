The murals of the ancient Goguryeo tombs scattered around the Pyongan provinces in North Korea were designated as a World Heritage site at the General Conference of Unesco in 2004.

The tie between Hirayama and Goguryeo goes back to 1967.

Four years later, another surprising incident occurred.

Owing to his effort of making nine visits to North Korea, dedication to the cause of Unesco and personal efforts to persuade people around him, the Goguryeo murals became the cultural heritage of the world instead of just being the treasure of Koreans.

He had devoted his life to painting with a Buddhistâ€™s attitude and passed away last week at the age of 79.
