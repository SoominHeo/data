A baktun is the ancient calendar with a cycle of 394 solar years that the Mayans used for recording their history.

Recently, a lot of so-called scientific evidence has been added to support the prediction that 2012 will be the “Last Judgment.”

Astrologers claimed that the planets of the solar system would form a “grand cross,” which is mentioned in a prophecy of Nostradamus, centering on the sun in July 1999, and it would result in a big change in the magnetic field of the Earth.

However plausible the movie may sound, it is obvious that the members of 2012’s production team are not the least concerned with the predictions about doomsday in 2012.
