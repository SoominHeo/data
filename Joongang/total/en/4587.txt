On Nov. 17, 1905, when the so-called Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty was forcibly signed, Deoksu Palace and the meeting room were besieged by fully armed Japanese soldiers, with 800 cavalry, 5,000 artillery and 20,000 infantry exerting control over the whole metropolitan area of Seoul.

The emperorâ€™s right upon the treaty was prescribed under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Daehan (Korean) Empire promulgated in 1897.

Responsibilities for a ruin of the country should fall on Gojong, who enjoyed the inviolable rights of sovereignty, and the aristocrats who enjoyed privileges for the preceding 500 years.
