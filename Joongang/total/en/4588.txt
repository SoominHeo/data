It is picture that records the first encounter between General Douglas MacArthur, who marched into Japan as the de facto ruler after the end of World War II, and Emperor Hirohito, who lost his status as a living god and became human.

The photo was taken when public opinion in many countries that bore the brunt of Japan’s military might called for the Japanese ruler to be prosecuted as a war criminal, so it’s no wonder he was feeling a little tense when he first met MacArthur.

This time it is a photo of U.S. President Barack Obama bowing to the Japanese emperor, bending his upper body almost 90 degrees.

But I am of the opinion that the evaluation of the incident should be made on the grounds of whether one succeeded in winning the minds of the other side or not.
