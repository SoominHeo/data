Liverpool is proud of its association with the Beatles - all four band members were born and bred Liverpudlians.
Tourists keen to pay homage to the Fab Four arrive at the Liverpool John Lennon Airport and will inevitably visit Penny Lane, a street in the city that inspired the song of the same title, a nostalgic glance back at life in the neighborhood: “Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.”
Penny Lane is named after James Penny, a notorious 18th-century slave trader.
At that time, Liverpool was the busiest port in Europe from which a triangular trade operated.
Ships that started in Liverpool sailed to the west coast of Africa to trade European goods for slaves.
They then transported the human cargo to the Americas, where they were traded for cash crops - sugar, tobacco and coffee - and then sailed back over the Atlantic to Europe.
Around 10 million African slaves were traded in this way, though many more died on the voyage across the ocean, living in squalid, cramped conditions until they finally reached shore.

In 2007, the city opened the International Slavery Museum, which exposes the grim reality of its past.
In the museum, visitors can experience through virtual reality the horrendous conditions that the African men, women and children had to suffer.


Around 10 million African slaves were traded in this way, though many more died on the voyage across the ocean, living in squalid, cramped conditions until they finally reached shore.

In 1999, the city council officially denounced its past, apologizing for its long association with the slave trade.
