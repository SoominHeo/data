In a report released last week, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that the Taliban in Afghanistan earn between $90 million and $160 million annually from opium-related businesses.
Now the Silk Road of old days has been turned into “the heroin road” according to the report, and the money from Russia and Europe flows into the hands of the Taliban.
In order to cut off the money flow, the United States is encouraging Afghan farmers to cultivate alternative crops even by paying them subsidies.
At the same time, the United States is squeezing the distribution network of narcotics through the world.
In Korea, Pakistanis who smuggled out acetic anhydride, which is used in refining heroin, were arrested and sentenced to a five-year jail term last week.
