Today, with over 40,000 Vietnamese women married to Korean men, many Korean people have in-laws in Vietnam and vice versa.
The relationship between Korea and Vietnam is still evolving.
On Wednesday, President Lee Myung-bak had a summit with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, and the two agreed to upgrade their “comprehensive partnership” to a “strategic cooperative” relationship.
Nguyen said that “Korea is not a friend but family” and that the “two countries are moving beyond a relationship of understanding and trust, and entering a stage of love.”
Could it be that after 800 years we are seeing a reinstatement of the relations between the Hwasan general and his adopted country?

In 1995, representatives of the Hwasan Lee family visited Vietnam.

Three important figures, including the general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist party, came out to greet the representatives, who were given Vietnamese citizenship and treated better than national guests.

In 2002, an opera about the life of Prince Ly Long Tuong was presented in Hanoi.

Later, when Mongolian soldiers attacked the area, he built a mud castle, where he stayed for five months.
