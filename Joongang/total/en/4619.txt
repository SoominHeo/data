Although the number of visitors decreased by 300,000 compared to last year, the event was considered a success because it went ahead despite three bearish factors: the threats of terrorism, the new flu and the international financial crisis.
Participants drank 6.5 million liters (1.72 million gallons) of beer, more or less the same as last year, and ate the equivalent of 111 heads of cattle, seven more than last year.
The festival sponsors say success is due to loyal drinkers who gather each year for the celebration of beer.
Oktoberfest became famous when American soldiers discovered it after the end of World War II.
They were followed by American tourists, and then tourists from other European countries, Australia and Japan.
What captivated the minds of visitors most was beer in tall, one-liter beer mugs and the noisy atmosphere in the festival tents and drinking spots.
