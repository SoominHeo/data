U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 while still in office, was selected in recognition of his contribution to ending the Russo-Japanese War through mediation.
However, people pointed out that Roosevelt pursued foreign policy based on power and not pacifism, and therefore he did not deserve the prize.
For example, the Taft-Katsura Agreement, which was signed between the United States and Japan when Roosevelt was in office, gave Japan permission to invade the Korean Peninsula.
There are controversies over the awarding of the peace prize to President Barack Obama of the United States, who advocates a “nuclear-free world.”
Since people have said that the peace prize committee stakes its prestige on “vision” for peace rather than “accomplishments,” President Obama must be feeling a lot of pressure after receiving the prize.
Like Alfred Nobel, who learned a lesson from his premature obituary, Obama will have to work hard for the implementation of his vision for peace.
I sincerely hope that future writers will not list Obama as the 51st scandalous Nobel Prize awardee.
