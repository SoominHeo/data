In her initial “State of the Village Report,” however, she wrote about a population of 1,000, and confronted such troublesome issues like environmental problems and national security matters.

At the plenary session of the UN General Assembly and the G-20 Summit Meeting held last week - which respectively represent the “global village’s” town hall meeting and a meeting of the village elders - the outdated war of nerves over finding solutions to global environmental problems were rekindled.
