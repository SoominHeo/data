The line “His excellency the golden calf” in the song referred to Lee Yong-ik (1854-1907), the courtier in charge of the imperial court’s finances who supervised the flow of money in and out of the emperor’s coffers.

In 1904, he was promoted to the highest position in the government.

Before he died in 1907, he wrote a memorandum to the emperor calling on him to “restore the sovereignty by establishing modern schools and educating talented youths.”
