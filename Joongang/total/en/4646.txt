As Lee said in the speech, the nuclear standoff has repeated a pattern of dialogue and tension, progress and setbacks, then stalemates, over the past 20 years.
If we continue to walk the same trail - the North agrees to halt the nuclear program and it’s rewarded for that only to later violate the commitment - then it’s obvious we can’t escape the old pattern.
U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged that he would not enter step-by-step negotiations, likely because he fully understands that the United States had been deceived by the North Korean “salami tactics,” in which it tries to maximize its profits by taking small slices.
President Lee said he mentioned his plan to Obama during their summit in June and spoke of the necessity of the consultation among the five states, other than North Korea, within the six-party framework.
In other words, the five countries needed to have concrete discussions on the complete dismantlement of a North Korean nuclear program and on their course of action to accomplish that.
