So the man changed the offer and said, “Fine, I will give you four in the morning and three in the evening.”
The monkeys welcomed the change.

Nevertheless, monkeys are foolish enough to pursue more up front with less later.
The Western version of the same story concludes that the monkeys are “smart” on the basis of financial theory.
That is, considering the time value of money, four in the morning and three in the evening is more profitable than vice versa.
For example, there is a clear difference between receiving 400 million won ($332,000) today and 300 million a year later and vice versa.
If an annual interest rate of 10 percent is applied, the present value of the first payment plan amounts to about 672.7 million won, while the latter is about 663.6 million only.
Of course, smart monkeys will choose the former plan that will pay 9.09 million won more.


It is the comparison between “three in the morning and four in the evening” and “four in the morning and three in the evening.”

One of them is the “windfall” bonus system of the financial world.

Ahead of the G-20 summit meeting scheduled for Thursday in Pittsburgh, the United States, the heads of state emphasize the necessity to regulate the bonus system.
