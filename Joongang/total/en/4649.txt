The leader of the boy band 2PM, Park Jaebeom, had to fly back to his hometown of Seattle because of a complaint about Korea he had posted on a Web site four years ago.
The fact that he is a Korean-American who is exempt from military service in Korea is probably an additional reason that fanned antipathy toward him.
People poured a barrage of criticism against him, claiming that he should go home immediately.
I wonder whether the criticism that he was not familiar with the Korean way of life four years ago was why he wrote “I hate Koreans” on a Web site.


But Heon-tae, which is his Korean name, cannot recite even the first part of the national anthem.
