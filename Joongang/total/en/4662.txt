The budget for social overhead capital, which was to be reduced due to financial restraints, has been restored to its original scale, as the government is no doubt taking into account the local elections scheduled for next year.
The pressure from politicians and local autonomous organizations, worried that the budget for social overhead capital would be sacrificed at the expense of the river project, was strong enough to sway the government.
Under this plan, it is a certainty that the financial deficit will continue to grow.
Minister Yoon said, “The government will manage to maintain sound finances.”
However, the total amount of national debt will amount to 366 trillion won, or 35.6 percent of GDP, at the end of the year.


It seems that the scale of the budget is growing while the government tries to clear up suspicion that money for some areas would be cut or eliminated to help fund the four river restoration project.

The proposed increase in the money pumped into welfare is more than two times the rate of the overall budget increase, which is in compliance with the idea that the government should pursue “politics for grassroots people.”
