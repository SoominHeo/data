The lives of six innocent South Koreans were lost due to an unexpected discharge of floodwater from Hwanggang Dam in North Korea.
It is not yet known whether the flooding was an intentional offensive against the South, but it has awakened awareness of the hazardous effects of flooding.

Some 70 percent of the human body is made up of water.


Once there was a place called Khara Khoto, but it was ruined in a harsh Gobi Desert sandstorm.

According to the legend, Khara Khoto resisted three attacks by the Mongolian troops.
