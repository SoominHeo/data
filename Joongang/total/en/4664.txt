When they encountered a man in his 30s, they didn’t believe he was the famous Yoo.
So they angrily demanded the “real Yoo Ki-hyeon.”
When Yoo was recording the last episode of the show in October 1978, he couldn’t control himself and actually burst into tears, revealing that he had terminal breast cancer.
Yoo was awarded the Grand Radio Broadcasting Prize that year, but he died soon afterward.
The radio serial established a record as the longest-running drama, with 4,408 episodes.
