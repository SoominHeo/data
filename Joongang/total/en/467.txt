Inflectra  — a generic drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis — has the same effect as the original drug Remicade, but the price is 30 to 40 percent cheaper.

Seo Jung-Jin, CEO and founder of Celltrion, had been a promising employee at Daewoo Motors, as seen in his eye-catching promotion to board member at the age of 34.

Seo kicked off a project to develop Inflectra after investing 400 billion won in 2006.
