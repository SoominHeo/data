Kim Ki-nam, a senior official of the North’s Workers’ Party leading a delegation to attend the late former President Kim Dae-jung’s state funeral, conveyed North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s verbal message desiring “progress in inter-Korean cooperation” while adding he, too, hoped the two Koreas can work together to resolve bilateral issues.

The delegation that flew into Seoul for the Sunday funeral took procedures as special envoys by first meeting the unification minister and then visiting the president.
