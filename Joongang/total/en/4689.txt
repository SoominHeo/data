As proof, he pointed to the number of people searching for the phrase “economic recession” on Google, which in the beginning of the year had soared to four times more than usual but has now dropped conspicuously.
He explained this as a sign of the market’s recovery of confidence.
Alan Greenspan, while serving as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is said to have examined the amount of garbage, number of customers at dry cleaners and the sales of men’s underwear.
He did so because households produce more garbage and send more clothes to the dry cleaners when the economy is strong.
On the contrary, if sales of men’s underwear - which usually do not fluctuate much - dwindle, it means the economy has abruptly turned bad.

At board meetings, he used to persuade his colleagues by saying he was starting to feel pain in his stomach.
Earning his living from making economic predictions for over 50 years, he is said to have felt the signs of crises from his stomachaches.
