If the union stages the walkout, more than 10,000 banking outlets across the country will be paralyzed.

If the labor union pushes forward with the strike, which is expected to see almost 100,000 members participate, local banks cannot avoid a colossal crisis befitting an unprecedented “act of terror through a strike.”

That’s why Financial Services Commission Chairman Yim Jong-yong held an emergency meeting yesterday with the heads of seven major commercial banks.

The union plans to kick off a strike to thwart the management’s attempt to introduce a performance-based salary system that could mean a 40 percent pay gap between the highest- and lowest-performing employees.
