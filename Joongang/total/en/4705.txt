There are 336 rivers and streams that flow into Lake Baikal in Siberia.

There is a huge rock where the Angara River and Lake Baikal merge into one another.

Since 1957, during the deep winter of the Cold War, Angara was used as a code name indicating the construction of a secret nuclear missile facility aimed at the Western world.

The Naro-1, or KSLV-I (Korea Space Launch Vehicle-I), Koreaâ€™s first carrier rocket - which was scheduled to be launched this coming Tuesday, but was postponed - is said to transform the Angara rocket being developed by Russia and use it as the first phase rocket.
