In 1962, Japanese record producer Johnny Kitagawa unleashed the Johnnys, a group of four handsome young boys.
The members’ ages at the time ranged from 16 to 18.

One important rule in the close to 50-year history of Johnny &amp; Associates is this: “No celebrity who started out as a member of an idol group has been more successful solo than when he or she was a group member.”
This is the case for Korean idols who have been active for around 20 years too.
In addition, the TVXQ brand is still growing, targeting the whole of Asia.


The members’ ages at the time ranged from 16 to 18.

Three of the group’s members are objecting to their agency’s treatment and alleged unfair division of profits, saying, “A contract term of 13 years is actually a life contract.”

Thirteen years is definitely a long time, but is 11 billion won really unfairly low?

If a company with average annual sales of less than 30 billion won were to pay one of its departments 11 billion won over five years, this would hardly be seen as “exploitation.”
