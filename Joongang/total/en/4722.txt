One hundred people died in Japan because of the earthquake.
Even when the exact term is not used, any waves or fluctuations of sea level due to an earthquake on the seabed are technically tsunami.
On July 12, 1993, another earthquake occurred in the sea southwest of Hokkaido, which caused a wave on Korea s east coast, damaging 57 fishing boats.
On July 20, 1993, these words from Professor Oh Im-sang of Seoul National University were printed:  If a wave starts in the sea near Japan it can reach Korea in two to three hours, so we must immediately go into preparatory positions in case there is a seabed earthquake.
