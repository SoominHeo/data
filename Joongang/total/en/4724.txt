The Ministry of National Defense s project to integrate and systemize information and data on armament and military supplies was originally supposed to be handled by one organization.
But in fact the military, the navy and the defense ministry all worked on the project, increasing costs as a result.
Tens of billions of won (tens of millions of dollars) have been wasted on such inefficient and redundant projects.
In many cases, according to data in the report, projects were drawn up in a sloppy and hasty manner, which led to even more costs than initially planned.
A good example of this is the Incheon International Airport Railroad.
The demand estimates were way off, and the state must compensate by spending a whopping 14 trillion won over the next 30 years.
