Could Emperor Gojong have imagined that this day would come when he was stunned to see the deoknyulpung 100 years ago?


Three phones for Emperor Gojong were installed at Deoksu Palace.

In Yeom Sang-seop s story,  The Telephone,  the mysterious equipment was described as  a square-shaped wooden box with two metal bells the color of white brass on top.

After Emperor Gojong died in 1919, a deoknyulpung line was set up between Changdeok Palace where Emperor Sunjong used to stay and Hongneung, Emperor Gojong s grave.
