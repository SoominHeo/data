In 2012, he returned to Korea upon graduating from a prestigious university in the United States.
But he was faced with the reality of job searching.
That year, he interned at a Korean financial company for about six months, and it was the only work experience he had.

The overall turnout was 54.2 percent.
As their voting rate is low, politicians care less about the young people.


A 28-year-old man is afraid to go home.

In 2012, he returned to Korea upon graduating from a prestigious university in the United States.

That year, he interned at a Korean financial company for about six months, and it was the only work experience he had.

In the last five years, he has applied to dozens of companies every year.

He would sometimes have a drink to relieve the stress, but his parents would scold him, saying, “How could you go out drinking when you don’t even have a job?”In these beautiful days of sunshine and cherry blossoms, one in eight young Koreans welcome spring anxiously.

The unemployment rate of those in their 30s and 50s are 3.4 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.

350,000 young people are not included in the statistics as they “did not work but did not search for job.”
