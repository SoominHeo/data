The FTA with the European Union is Korea s second major trade deal after a similar agreement with the United States.
The EU, a 27-nation economic bloc with a combined gross domestic product of $18.3 trillion, is Korea s second-largest export market after China, accounting for $58 billion in annual revenue.
If companies respond to the FTA by boosting productivity, industrial output could increase by 5.5 percent, and 290,000 new jobs could be created.
