The United States and Russia have agreed on a framework to further reduce their combined nuclear arsenals, which account for 95 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world.

The United States and Russia currently possess 2,200 and 2,800 nuclear warheads, respectively, and nuclear delivery systems totaling 1,190 and 810 units each.

In a speech in Prague last April, Obama declared “with conviction America’s commitment and desire to see the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.”

The U.S. and Russian leaders were of one voice in demanding that Iran and North Korea accept international warnings about their nuclear programs.
