Waste levels have already reached 10,000 tons and will overwhelm storage capacity by 2016.
Thus, recovering our peaceful nuclear sovereignty makes sense when viewed only from the economic side.
Furthermore, renegotiating the terms of the pact is necessary anyhow, as the current agreement with the United States expires in 2014.


According to the pact with the United States agreed to in 1974, South Korea cannot domestically enrich uranium and reprocess used nuclear fuel without the consent of Washington.

The country also must dump waste from 700 tons of nuclear fuel - generated from 20 reactors - in water tanks due to the ban on recycling.
