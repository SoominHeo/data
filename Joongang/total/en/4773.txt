At the end of the ninth century, the third queen of Silla, Queen Jinseong, was a ruler who failed to live up to her predecessor, Queen Seondeok.

One day, someone anonymously criticized Jinseong s misgovernment in writing, and placed the piece on the market.

The royal court was turned upside down on July 19, 1504, when it was revealed that a document criticizing the oppressive government of Yeonsangun had leaked within the Hanyang ministry.
