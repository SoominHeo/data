But just a year after the Olympics in 1989, the government abruptly scrapped daylight saving time without any particular explanation, as many had expected.

British builder and avid outdoorsman William Willett published a proposal in 1907 to call upon the country to make better use of longer daylight during summer months.

This morning in Seoul, the sun rose at 5:14 a.m.

The changing of the clocks was one of the sideline topics between President Lee Myung-bak and Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in Tokyo during their summit on Sunday.

Knowing the working environment in the two countries, however, it could be argued that daylight saving time will only lengthen the work hours of laborers.
