In the year 980, when the Vikings led by Erik the Red sailed to Greenland from Iceland, Greenland was a relatively warm place.
In those days the land was covered with a considerable amount of wooded areas.
Vikings cleared away swathes of forest for timber and to create pastures for their livestock to graze on.
However, the disappearance of the woods soon caused soil erosion and led to a remarkable decrease in agricultural production.
From the 1300s, the area we now know as Greenland became cold.

Poor nations are especially vulnerable to natural disasters, while the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters have the resources to minimize the possibility of being victims of global warming by building dikes or improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.
With its “green growth” policies, Korea envisions it will become one of the world’s leading green powers.
Greenland, meanwhile, in its development policies, has at least demonstrated some consideration for current and future generations - and other species - living on earth.
A persistent controversy surrounding the restoration project of the four major rivers as a driver for green growth is mainly due to a lack of such careful consideration.
Although it is necessary to boost the nation’s economy and secure abundant water resources, we should be aiming to develop Korea as a new Greenland.


From the 1300s, the area we now know as Greenland became cold.

In May of last year, more than 130,000 people died after a devastating tropical cyclone, leaving nearly 2 million homeless.
