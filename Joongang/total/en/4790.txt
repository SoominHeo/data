One of Lee’s campaign pledges involved cutting spending on private education by half.
But last year, the first year of his administration, total spending on private education amounted to 20.9 trillion won ($15.9 billion), a 4.3 percent increase from the year before.
The president berated education officials for not having actively implemented his policy directives and scolded them, saying that even his daughter did not believe that his pledge would be realized.
This is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed.
Excessive spending on private education damages household budgets and diminishes the quality of public education.
Now that the president has made his wishes on the subject known, it would be reasonable to expect that new measures will be presented and implemented quickly.
Still, there are concerns that the president’s scolding and stern requests will result in an education policy that is made in haste, when it is a matter that must be handled carefully.
Calls for a ban on classes in private institutes after 10 p.m. have arisen again.
