Released one year after the war broke out, the song uses a sleepless soldier on the battlefield to drum up support to fight against the North’s invasion.
The first verse begins as follows: “Leaves fly/ Over the battlefield under the moonlight/ Soundlessly falling/ Dewdrops feel cold.”


The heart of a song can usually be found in the first verse.

Rarely must one wait until halfway through a song to hear the lyrics that reveal the feelings that led to the song’s title.
