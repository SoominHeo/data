In 1965, when North Korea announced it would enter the World Cup preliminaries, South Korea chose not to participate.
The idea was that it would be better not to enter at all than to lose to the North.
Just as expected, North Korea made it through the preliminary round and won 1 to 0 against the powerful Italians in the next round to enter the quarterfinals, causing quite a stir in international soccer.
Shocked, South Korea reorganized its team and attempted to take on its counterpart at the 1970 Mexico World Cup, but that time North Korea backed out.

I just hope both will play admirably in the finals and we will be able to re-enact the scene of our players putting their arms around each other, as they did in 1978.

Shocked, South Korea reorganized its team and attempted to take on its counterpart at the 1970 Mexico World Cup, but that time North Korea backed out.

Four years later in 1978, the Asian Games were held in Bangkok.

Both Korean teams drove on nonstop to face each other at the finals, and the game ended in a 0 to 0 tie.

However, when Kim finally made it onto the podium, he proposed, “Let’s join hands,” and the two captains put their arms around each other with smiles on their faces and gold medals around their necks.
