In the age of the fourth industrial revolution, national competitiveness hinges on talent in creative and convergence science.
But the current college entrance system and education environment precludes growth of such talents.
Data cited 
Applicants for higher level basic science studies — physics, chemical, life science, and earth science — among high school students studying for college entrance have shriveled to a tenth of the number five years ago.
Math and science students study for the rudimentary level merely to get good scores instead of the purpose of exploring deeper studies.
In 2012, the college applicants for high level chemistry studies totaled 36,238, or 5.58 percent of students taking the math and science college exams, but among 2016 candidates, the number reached a mere 3,936, or 0.67 percent.

We must retool the college entrance and educational system if we want to stay competitive in the fourth industrial revolution age.
