A South Korean social worker was abducted and later found dead in Yemen just three months after a suicide bomb claimed the lives of four South Korean tourists in the impoverished country on the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula.

The 12 million South Koreans traveling abroad every year are becoming more vulnerable to random violence against foreigners in some countries.

A Yemeni government investigation found that the March bomb attack on South Korean tourists was part of an Al-Qaeda campaign to display its resilience and strength to the Western world.
