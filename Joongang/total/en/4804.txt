Particularly from 2002 - when anti-North Korean sentiment grew after it was confirmed that North Korea had abducted Japanese nationals - anything that has something to do with the North has been a hot, newsworthy item.
Some scoops were the result of persistent work and considerable investment of human and financial resources.
But incorrect news reports, exaggerated stories and reports charged with emotion were produced as well.
Years ago, a private Japanese cable channel reported that it had received from a North Korean defector photos of two Japanese abductees taken in North Korea.
Later, however, it was confirmed that the people in the photos were other North Korean defectors living in South Korea and the photos hadn’t been taken in the North.
The TV channel had been hoodwinked by someone who was only after the money.
During a summit meeting between the South and the North, another Japanese media outlet reported incorrectly that a South Korean official who happened to be standing near Kim Jong-il when a photo was taken was in fact a North Korean spy working against Japan.
Unfortunately, these are not rare cases.
Many Japanese reports on North Korea are exaggerated or lack ground altogether.
A Japanese newspaper reported that Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-il’s first son, was preparing to seek asylum.
