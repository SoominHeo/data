Group members say they plan to designate Samsung as their second target in a boycott campaign, claiming that they will tell the public to buy over the Internet in China, that the company’s cell phones “are not better than those of Nokia yet are even more expensive” and that Samsung laptops emit too much heat.
Last week, the group bashed the major advertisers of the nation’s leading newspapers in support of smaller, progressive publications.
Now it seems determined to become a sales arm of Nokia by bashing its competitor Samsung.
It feels as if the group is filming a cheesy drama featuring a clumsy left-wing organization digging its own grave.
A legitimate campaign against a certain corporation and a baseless battle against a company are different matters entirely.
As the group has acknowledged, Samsung generates more than 90 percent of its sales revenue from overseas markets - and that is where the group is aiming its boycott.

It seems that an investigation would be a natural step, one that would help maintain the health of Korean society.
