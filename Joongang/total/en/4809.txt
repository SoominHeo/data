The country now holds more than 90 percent of the world market for hybrid vehicles, with Toyota and Honda at the center.
Yet Japan continues to innovate, developing even more budget-friendly vehicles with ever-increasing gas mileage.
At the same time Mitsubishi has developed a plug-in electric vehicle called i MiEV, which the company plans to unveil next month.
Although the car costs twice as much as a hybrid, it reduces fuel cost by a third.
Yet the biggest problems the vehicle faces revolve around the extensive time it takes to charge the battery and the short distance it travels.
However, even the Prius was derided as a car without much of a future when it was first developed 11 years ago.
So nobody really knows how the market for a plug-in electric vehicle will turn out.
Compared to Japan, the Korean automobile industry is still stuck in a rut.
Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, the country’s top two automakers, need to resolve issues with their labor unions.

However, the gas milage of these vehicles still comes in at 17.8 kilometers per liter - much less than their Japanese counterparts.
