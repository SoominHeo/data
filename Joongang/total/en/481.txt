In the past five years, the number of Tokyo residents has grown by 500,000 even as Japan’s total population shrinks.
Though the birth rate in Tokyo is 1.15 — lower than the national average of 1.42 — the greater Tokyo area is also absorbing young people from other regions.

It is located at the southernmost tip of the Izu Peninsula, a popular tourist destination.
The connection benefits both local governments.
There are 1,240 people on the waiting list for the nursing home.
It would cost about 20 billion won ($17.4 million) to buy a building large enough to house 100 people in Tokyo, while the same site in Minamiizu would cost one twentieth of that.

Some criticize that the new plan forcibly moves seniors to remote places.
But it is at least an attempt to benefit both urban and rural areas.

The number of seniors older than 75 is a particularly serious concern.

To deal with the imminent issues, Suginami District in Tokyo has begun constructing a facility for seniors with 100 beds in its sister city of Minamiizu in Shizuoka Prefecture.

There are 1,240 people on the waiting list for the nursing home.

It is a great opportunity for Minamiizu, whose population is 8,700.
