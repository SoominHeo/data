“Of all those numerous stars, one in particular looks down upon me/ Of all these countless people, my eyes are set upon one particular star/   … So intimate are the star and I/ Makes me wonder where and in what form we will meet the next time.”

In Buddhism, the period of tearful mourning should last for 49 days at most.
