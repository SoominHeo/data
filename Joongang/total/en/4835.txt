Korea and Asean on Tuesday signed a free trade agreement on investment, a process that had dragged on for four years.
When the investment deal comes into effect, combined with previously ratified Korea-Asean FTAs for merchandise and services, bilateral trade and investment between Korea and Asean is expected to increase.
The leaders agreed upon an ambitious goal - they will try to increase the trade volume between Korea and Asean member nations from $90 billion last year to $150 billion by 2015.

The 40-point statement requires the related countries to keep their promises or it will be nothing more than a piece of paper.
