If the property rights act was as severe in the 1970s as it is today, who would have earned the most money from royalties in Korea?
Surprisingly, the answer is not the most popular singers of the time like Lee Mi-ja or Na Hun-a, but rather the late President Park Chung Hee.
“Saemaul Norae,” or “The Song of a New Village” in English, was the theme song for the Saemaul Movement.
Written by Park himself, the song blared across the nation day and night, exhorting the people to work hard to modernize the country.
“Thatched-roof houses will be gone and roads into villages will be widened,” the song went.
Park’s favorite song, however, was “Dongbaek Agassi,” or the “Camellia Girl.”
In 1979, former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda visited Korea and dined with Park at the Blue House.

The third song that is commonly associated with Park is “Gue Ddae Gue Saram” or “The Man at that Time”
