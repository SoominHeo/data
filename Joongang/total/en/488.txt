Angry women in Daegu started a campaign to boycott the brewery’s products by distributing leaflets and stickers in subway stations in the city, and 63 civic groups in the nation set up a headquarters for the campaign.
According to those advocacy groups, the worker, who was hired in 2011, informed her boss of her marriage plans two months before her wedding in December 2015.
Instead of receiving congratulations from the boss, she has been under constant pressure to leave the company.
Even after getting married, she has been ostracized by her colleagues at the company.
After tolerating unbearable stress for the past two months, she sued the company’s CEO in January on charges of violating the labor law before submitting her resignation to the company in March.
Women’s rights groups say Kumbokju has fired all women workers who get married for the past 58 years and that its 10 current female employees are all single.


The figure went down to 1.21 last year.
