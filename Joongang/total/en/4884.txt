The shutdown of underperforming schools that began on a small scale in a few places including New York, Washington, D.C. and Chicago during the Bush administration has gathered pace to cover as much as 5 percent of all the schools in the country.
A country cannot really hope for future growth without securing competitiveness in its education sector.
That applies to the United States as well as to Korea.
But even though shuttering schools with sluggish academic performance seems like a good solution for the United States, it is an unrealistic solution for Korea.
However, to the extent that filtering out unqualified principals and teachers boosts educational competitiveness, we should come up with an appropriate system of our own to take us toward that goal.
The first step to reforming our education system is finding qualified principals to lead the charge.
Without passion and willingness to improve the quality of school education, no principal can hope to see this task to its successful conclusion.
This was why, for the first time in Korea, the Busan Education Office initiated a system for assessing principals last year.
The office plans to exclude principals who score lower than 3 percent in the assessment from its regular review for reappointment.
