That figure is likely to overtake  last year’s record of 256 organ donations, the most donations in Korean history.
Last year, 174 people were the recipients of cornea transplants, but by the end of April this year 119 people had already regained vision, which means the number can only increase through the rest of the year.
It is in this atmosphere of growing support for organ donation that the government plans to revise related rules and regulations to simplify the complicated procedures that have previously prevented the increase in the number of donations.
We welcome the government’s decision because it will enhance public awareness about  organ donation and ensure that more people can donate and receive organs.
The basic aim of the existing organ donation law, enacted 10 years ago, put more weight on preventing rampant declarations of brain death and putting an end to the underground organ trade.
