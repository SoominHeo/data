Ahn Pyeong, an excellent calligrapher at that time, wrote the title and some 20 people including Kim Jong-seo, Seong Sam-mun, Park Paeng-nyeon, Choi Hang and Lee Gae, wrote and recited poems in praise of the painting.
It became a masterpiece that combined poetry, calligraphy and painting.
A few years later in 1453, Prince Suyang staged a coup.
He falsely accused his brother Anpyeong of a conspiracy and sentenced him to death.
Prince Anpyeong’s artistic friends were killed as well.
If Mongyudowondo, which bears the stamps of the rebellious officials, had been delivered to Prince Suyang, the painting would have been regarded as evidence of the plot and burned.
Nobody knows for sure, but perhaps the artwork was saved by someone who realized the aesthetic value of the painting.
After the coup, the whereabouts of the painting remained unknown.
But some 470 years later, the painting turned up in Japan in 1929.
A merchant in Osaka who was in possession of the painting at that time publicized the artwork’s existence among scholars.
An 1893 certificate stating that the painting was the property of the Shimasu family was attached.
The Shimasu were kin to the feudal lord who ruled what is now Kagoshima for a hundred years.

In coordination  with Tenri University, which holds the painting today,  Mongyudowondo will be borrowed and displayed for four weeks, as was done in 1996.
It is pleasing that we can appreciate our cultural heritage that contains the spirit of our ancestors.


The Shimasu were kin to the feudal lord who ruled what is now Kagoshima for a hundred years.

But since there are no records on the whereabouts of the painting before 1893, we cannot define it as having been stolen.
