The issue of allowing hospitals to pursue profits has not been resolved at all; Seoul said it would postpone it to November.
The plan is a bit better on education.
Foreign educational institutes are now allowed to send money back to their home countries if their schools in Korea make a profit.
But foreign profit-making corporations are still not allowed to invest in Korean schools.
For an industry to be competitive and lead to economic growth and the creation of new jobs, investment and competition are most important.
Anybody must be allowed to invest in hospitals, schools and media outlets and run businesses in those fields.
Everyone knows that if for-profit corporations are not allowed in those fields, they will not become competitive.
Gradual change will minimize negative effects.
The issue will be left to ministries, but if they do not act by November, the president must then step in.


That must be why public employees have been working hard on the plan for four months, as the deputy prime minister in charge said.

If the service sector was a chess game, the two fields are like a rook and a pawn.

Thus, we believe that if the two fields progress the service sectorâ€™s other problems will be resolved easily.
