In 1921, the Japanese colonial government ordered pedestrians and motor vehicles to uniformly keep to the left side.

The government recently announced that it would undo the 88-year-old pedestrian traffic legacy to encourage people to walk on the right side of walkways.

It is actually strange that politicians never got around to changing the traffic rule until now, given their obsession over whether one is on the right or the left of the political spectrum.
