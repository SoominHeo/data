Economists questioned the governmentâ€™s rosy estimate that the river project would create 190,000 new jobs and 23 trillion won in benefits from manufacturing.
We agree with this criticism to a point.
The possibility of water contamination is most worrisome.
Under its plan, the government will build 16 reservoirs near the four rivers - the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan - with small- and medium-sized dams to store 1.25 billion tons of water.

We need to restore the four rivers, but without damaging other natural resources.
   

Under its plan, the government will build 16 reservoirs near the four rivers - the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan - with small- and medium-sized dams to store 1.25 billion tons of water.

We nevertheless endorse the idea of reviving these four major rivers and believe the project should not be delayed.

If we can secure 1.25 billion tons of water from the project, as the government claims, we would be saved from chronic drought.

We hope that they would support the idea first and put forward constructive ideas and suggestions to minimize contamination and help make the project successful.

It aims to start construction of reservoirs and dams by September, but only began tests late last year.
