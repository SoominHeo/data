In a high-ceilinged, brick-walled room, a ray of sunlight peeping through the curtains of a small window is the only source of warmth and light until a cellist of advanced years starts playing one of Bach’s somber cello sonatas.

Photographer Yousuf Karsh (1908-2002) pauses to listen before taking a picture of the Spanish maestro Pablo Casals.

He finally picked up his camera once he believed he had gotten to know his subject.

Sympathizing is the first step toward opening someone’s mind, and  Karsh was happy to share in the joy and sorrow of the people he worked with.
