The moment the student Lee Sang-eun appeared on the same stage four years later is also still talked about.
However, such stars soon disappear.
More and more TV programs feature regular people with talent, but why are no more unexpected stars being born?
There are several reasons: Song festivals now focus on new talent trained by entertainment agencies and society places more importance on appearance now.
However, we shouldn’t ignore the producers of the show who put Potts in the limelight and perfectly packaged his story.
After all, no stone shines on its own unless someone polishes it.
It’s arguable that the real stars of the show are the production people who unearth candidates with less than average looks, seemingly unfulfilled lives but great voices, and then package them into hit products.
And we can’t expect to see the arrival of a new voice unless the public is prepared to crack open wallets and purses and pay for the merchandise.
In the U.K., Potts sold 680,000 copies of his debut album “One Chance.”


On June 9, 2007, a 37-year-old mobile phone salesman called Paul Potts appeared on the British TV show “Britain’s Got Talent.”

The 47-year-old Scot wore frumpy clothes, lived by herself with a cat called Pebbles and admitted she had never been kissed.
