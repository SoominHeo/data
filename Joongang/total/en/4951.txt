A taboo was broken when the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation on Wednesday disclosed its analysis of results of the annual college entrance test for the past five years.
Past administrations have stuck to the principle of withholding test results since the national test was introduced in 1993, citing the possibility of unwanted side effects such as firing up competition.
More details of the test results will be released later this month after lawmakers have had a chance to inspect raw data, which, it is hoped, will help schools enhance the quality of public school education, going beyond simply satisfying parents’ and students’ right to know.
What’s interesting about the results from the institute’s investigation is the clear gap between urban and rural areas, and between schools in the same region designated by the government to provide egalitarian education.
Under egalitarian education, students are sent to different high schools on a random basis, regardless of their academic achievements.
This policy, which has remained intact for the past 35 years, guarantees equal opportunities for students no matter what their academic performance is by having them study under the same circumstances.
