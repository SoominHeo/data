Trade among the three countries accounts for just 25 percent of their external trade.
That’s quite small when compared with the 70 percent shared among EU countries and the 40 percent among the countries bound by the North American Free Trade Agreement.


Participating members concluded that the three major Asian economies should take the initiative to set up a regional monetary fund and challenge protectionist trade practices.

The 30-member forum of regional experts and economists also proposed creating a regional trade bloc that could help to guard against the protectionist, nationalistic trade climate that has emerged amid the continuing economic downturn around the world.

The three export-driven economies have long been dependent on the United States and European markets to propel their economies, but the model upon which growth in those markets has been based is facing a serious challenge.

That’s quite small when compared with the 70 percent shared among EU countries and the 40 percent among the countries bound by the North American Free Trade Agreement.

We hope the governments of the three countries will take the suggestions proposed by the economic forum to heart.
