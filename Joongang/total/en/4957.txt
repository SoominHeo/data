In 1919, upholding the March 1 Independence Movement, our forefathers established the first government of a democratic Korean republic.
Our present-day Constitution declares that the Republic of Korea inherits the legitimacy of the provisional government.
It is not too much to say that the provisional government prepared the foundation for today’s Korea.
The official name of the country was also adopted from the provisional government.
Despite extremely difficult challenges, the government eluded pursuit by Imperial Japan and carried out its fight for independence.
After liberation, leaders of the provisional government continued to make efforts to preserve Korea’s independence by, for instance, opposing trusteeship.
Many organizations have held various events to commemorate the 90th anniversary.
