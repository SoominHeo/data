A legend circulated about a hidden message inside the watch, and on March 11, The Washington Post confirmed the legend was in fact true.
The message, inscribed by watchmaker Jonathan Dillon on April 13, 1861, reads, “Fort Sumter was attacked by the rebels on the above date.

I’ll only be able to use the watch this one time.’ So I took Yoon’s watch and gave him mine, as a token.”
One person survived and devoted himself to national independence, and one gave up his life, leaving only his name to history.


The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. holds the pocketwatch of the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.

A legend circulated about a hidden message inside the watch, and on March 11, The Washington Post confirmed the legend was in fact true.

The message, inscribed by watchmaker Jonathan Dillon on April 13, 1861, reads, “Fort Sumter was attacked by the rebels on the above date.

“Baekbeomilji,” Kim Gu’s autobiography, describes the scene on the morning of April 29, 1932, when the great event took place.

Your watch is worth 2 won, so let’s trade.

I’ll only be able to use the watch this one time.’ So I took Yoon’s watch and gave him mine, as a token.”

It is strange that the stories told by two watches can be so different.
