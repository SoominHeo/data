Suspicions arose that Roh’s son was involved in an $5 million investment from Park to Roh’s niece’s husband, Yeon Cheol-ho.
Roh Gun-ho, the son, visited Park with Yeon to Vietnam.
Around that time, Roh Gun-ho had no income, but he went to school in the United States and invested $100,000 into a friend’s company.


In his first statement, posted on Tuesday, Roh said he had apologized, but that does not mean he had actually done so.

Chung received 300 million won in cash and 100 million won in gift certificates from Park.

As a person who once led this country, Roh should face the entire nation, rather than only talking to his supporters.
