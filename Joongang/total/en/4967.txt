In fact, only 41.7 percent of reported embezzlement cases are prosecuted and lead to criminal charges.
The problem is civil servants can be tempted into bribery if the punishment handed out is so weak.
The city of Seoul’s new measures are expected to be an effective way to make civil servants stay honest.
But stringent anti-corruption measures alone are not enough.
We also need to see in place a system to detect and prevent corruption at the source.
That’s why we are pleased to see that the financial reward for reporting civil servant corruption has been raised from 50 million ($37,000) to 2 billion won.
This move seems to have proved effective: The number of corruption cases reported by people who were encouraged by the award increased from three in 2006 and six in 2007 to 12 last year when the reward was raised.

The city of Seoul can use the Seoul Call Center, “Dasan 120,” for civil servants to call in and report if they have been approached with a bribe.
