In July 1568, Confucian scholar Yi Hwang wrote a letter to the Joseon Dynasty’s King Seonjo who had just ascended the throne.
Yi wanted to pass on his vast knowledge of politics and wisdom as a great scholar and experienced politician to the 16-year-old king with little experience.

The king was suspicious and wondered how he could think of seven when it was difficult to find even one wise man.
Chunyu Kun answered, “Similar birds and animals flock together.
If one searches for dropwort or balloon flowers in a ditch he won’t find any in his lifetime.
But if he searches on the northern side of a hill he can immediately find a cartful of them.”
