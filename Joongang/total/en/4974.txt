That is the Mo Ibrahim Prize which was established in 2006.
The prize was named after its founder, Mo Ibrahim, 63, who was a successful businessman born in Sudan.

The first winner was Joaquim Chissano, the former president of Mozambique, and the second was Festus Mogae, the former president of Botswana.
In his acceptance speech, Chissano said he would pay back his debts when he received the prize money, which confirmed that the judges chose the right person.

The judges, including Kofi Annan, a former secretary general of the United Nations, have searched thoroughly for leaders who meet the requirements, and so far, two winners have been produced.

The first winner was Joaquim Chissano, the former president of Mozambique, and the second was Festus Mogae, the former president of Botswana.

Their solution is understandable considering state officials in Africa take one-fourth of the entire gross domestic product of the continent illegally and drain it overseas.
