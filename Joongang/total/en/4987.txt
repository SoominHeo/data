The government finally approved on Monday the construction of the second Lotte World.
Because of safety concerns, it has taken 15 years to decide whether or not to green-light the 112-story skyscraper.
Two years ago the Defense Ministry said the skyscraper would pose a safety risk to airplanes landing and departing from a runway at nearby Seongnam Air Base, but the ministry has now changed its mind.
The decision came as Lotte promised and agreed to shoulder the entire cost of changing the runway direction.
The company is slated to launch a groundbreaking ceremony as early as next February and complete the project in five years.
However, there is still strong opposition to the planned tower in political circles, among retired senior Air Force officers and civic groups.
Rumors abound that President Lee Myung-bak pressed the defense ministry to change its position.
In addition, there is talk that the angle of the new runway might not be safe.
Some critics have also raised the issue of national security and insinuated that there could even be some kind of collusion between the government and business.
That said, there are also many in favor of having a skyscraper in Seoul because of the economic benefits.
We cannot totally throw out our concerns about the governmentâ€™s decision to let the building go ahead.
We believe the No.
1 priority is security.
