The World Health Organization has found that children make up 20 percent of the worldâ€™s obese population.
This includes Korean children.
Health authorities here reported that the rate of obesity among young people aged two to 18 years shot up from 5.8 percent in 1997 to 9.7 percent in 2005.
In a survey by the Seoul Metropolitan Government last year, children who were obese accounted for 13.7 percent of the elementary, middle and high school populations.

Once the regulations are implemented next month, schools must clear foods high in calories and low in nutrients from their shop shelves, which will be beneficial considering that students regularly slurp instant noodles and chomp on potato chips during breaks.
