There appeared to be no reason for Ali, who had beat the strong-fisted George Foreman in Zaire 5 months before and was champion of both the WBA and WBC, to tense up at the prospect of taking on a 36-year-old white boxer who was past his prime.
Nobody thought Wepner would make it through more than three rounds.

The current Korean baseball team is probably the first ever in any sport since the country’s founding to receive such thunderous applause and so many cheers after losing a game to Japan.
The spirit of the players shone through, and the game was a real life lesson that the process is more important than the result.
In the last scene of Rocky, our champion, who is tired from fighting through 15 rounds, says disdainfully, “Ain’t gonna be no rematch.”
This is probably exactly how the Japanese players felt at the WBC finals.


Nobody thought Wepner would make it through more than three rounds.

Ali’s TKO victory was announced in round 15, 19 seconds before the end of the match, but the crowd rather admirably applauded Wepner’s fighting spirit.

Rocky’s pure passion has touched audiences around the world for around 30 years.

Still, Korea managed to balance Japan with two wins and two losses in the preliminary round, and kept the palms of baseball fans around the world sweaty as it led the game to an extra inning, where it unfortunately and dramatically lost.
