Elsewhere, four KTU members employed at the Kia Motors factory in Hwaseong were arrested by the South Chungcheong Provincial Police Agency on Thursday on charges of fraudulent gambling.
According to police, high-tech equipment was used in around 100 gaming sessions since June, with the perpetrators taking a whopping 2 billion won ($1.46 million) from their colleagues and other players.
It is surprising to see the labor community with so little sense of morality.
Not long ago, KTU members affiliated with the Hyundai Motor labor union were found to have been involved in a similar case.
But the KCTU is not alone.
The Federation of the Korean Trade Unions was regarded as a little bit better in terms of its moral standards, but a series of corruption cases have been discovered within the organization as well.
On March 13, prosecutors arrested a leading member of the cab drivers’ union on charges of taking a bribe from the former chief director of the cab company owners’ association.
At Kookmin Bank, an internal investigation and audit revealed that the executives of its labor union spent 40 million won in union dues on their personal entertainment.

The two umbrella unions must put an end to corruption within their ranks.
