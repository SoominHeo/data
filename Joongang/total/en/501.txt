In an act of revolt, Saenuri Party head Kim Moo-sung vetoed five candidates approved by a nomination committee dominated by loyalists of the president.

Kim declared the party would not field any candidates in the five constituencies and then departed for Busan without rubber-stamping the nominations.

He claimed he would stay there until the Friday deadline for candidate registration, which would disqualify the five candidates from running in the election.
