Under the Roh Moo-hyun presidency, it has been alleged, the former president’s brother, Roh Geon-pyeong and his closest aide, Lee Gang-cheol, had been receiving money from the second year of the administration.
President Lee Myung-bak’s second year in office is an appropriate time to push ahead with large-scale investment projects to boost the national economy, such as maintenance of the country’s four major rivers and the construction of the Seoul-Incheon canal.


The number of corruption cases often rises in any incumbent administration, especially as  the president moves into his second year of office.

A host of scandals took place during the second and third years of the Kim Dae-jung administration.
