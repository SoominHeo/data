About 130 million years ago, flowering plants appeared on Earth.
They evolved into five different groups during the 5 million years right after what is known as the “big bang” for flower evolution.

Flowers have undergone vast evolutionary changes and today comprise around 400,000 species.
A flower is a means of reproduction for plants.
Flowers have evolved to fit the shape of the snouts or beaks of birds, bats and insects, which help disperse pollen, resulting in more flowering and fruit formation.
In Madagascar, Charles Darwin discovered an orchid with white and waxy petals, Angraecum sesquipedale, with a nectar tube 30 centimeters in length with only the distal end filled with nectar.
He postulated that there must be an as yet undiscovered moth with a proboscis capable of extending 25 to 30 centimeters that visits this flower.
The predicted pollinator was discovered - a hawk moth now named Xanthopan morganii praedicta in southern Brazil.

At this rate, our descendants might wonder why the flower was associated with the 4.19 Democratization Movement.

Although it may seem like a long time, 5 million years is just a blink of an eye in geologic time, the Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history.

He postulated that there must be an as yet undiscovered moth with a proboscis capable of extending 25 to 30 centimeters that visits this flower.

The meteorological administration forecasts that forsythia, azaleas and cherry blossoms will be in full bloom 10 days earlier than usual due to warmer winter temperatures.

They predicted that forsythia, azaleas and cherry blossoms will spring to life on the 20th, 21st, and 4th day of the following month, respectively, in Seoul.
