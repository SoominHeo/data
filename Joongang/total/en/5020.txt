The Fair Trade Commission’s decision to enforce standard contracts for entertainers by June is a good, if not belated, decision.
The entertainment industry must develop a structure that is both more advanced and more professional.
In the current structure, in which many agencies make contracts that have them training entertainers, programming and even controlling the entertainers’ private lives, the conflicts and rumors about the agency-entertainer relationship will never end.
Agencies also need to become more transparent in their business dealings if they want to become part of an advanced industry.
It would be worthwhile to consider the introduction of a two-tiered management system similar to those that exist in New York and California.
In that system, one agency handles the entertainers’ legal affairs such as contracts and another is in charge of that person’s activities and performances.
A law proposing a U.S.-style certified agency system was proposed in the 17th National Assembly, but the effort went up in smoke.
“To be an entertainer” is always at the top of children’s dreams in surveys asking what they want to be when they grow up.
Last month an agency had an open contest for new talent.
The odds of getting in were 7,000:1.
