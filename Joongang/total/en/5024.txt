They cannot shoot them into the Earth’s orbit, or higher than 200 kilometers, as their budget couldn’t afford a costly rocket launcher.
But some CubeSats did make their way into space.
A CubeSat is a 10-centimeter cube-shaped satellite, a more sophisticated version than those built by participants in the CanSat competition.

Now, around 6,000 satellites are orbiting around the Earth.
Some are intelligence satellites with high-tech cameras that can even capture images of people sunbathing in the nude.

The satellite must have crashed somewhere into the Pacific Ocean.
North Korea announced that it would launch the Kwangmyongsong?2 soon.

In 2007, Colombia joined the club of countries that possess satellites, after it launched this kind of satellite in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

Now, around 6,000 satellites are orbiting around the Earth.

In 2006, a Russian cosmonaut who was staying in the International Space Station hit a golf ball into the Earth’s orbit.
