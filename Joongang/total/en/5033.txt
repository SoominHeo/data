The concert organizers have apparently offered refunds for the band’s concert in Japan slated for May, so there is no way of knowing when the group might play again.
X Japan formed in 1985 when Koreans had virtually no access to Japanese music.

Years later, when the Japanese pop music market started to open in 1998, the first album to be released was an instrumental version of the Best of X album.
Korean pop music was unaffected even after the market fully opened.
Some Korean singers have made a much greater impact than their Japanese counterparts, making money overseas thanks to a growing interest in Korean pop culture, a phenomenon known as the Korean Wave.
However, we never saw X Japan in Korea, because they officially broke up in 1997.
A concert was booked for Aug. 15, 2008, at Jamsil Stadium when the group announced a reunion in March last year, but many people objected.
“A Japanese band can’t perform in Seoul on Independence Day,” cried many.
The concert was put back to November, then to March, and now it has been postponed indefinitely amidst rumors of discord between group members.
It is next to impossible to see the group perform in Seoul, or anywhere else in Korea.

Speculation spread that illegal salesmen had probably brought around 200,000 albums to Korea from Japan.
