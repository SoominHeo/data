After the United States won independence from the British Crown, judges continued to wear wigs until the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall, abolished the tradition and simplified judicial robes into a gown-like  garment.
Here, we can see the spirit of pragmatic innovation in the New World.
Western judicial robes were first imported into Korea during Japan’s colonial rule (1910?1945).
Judges were forced to carry a sword until the March First Movement in 1919.
However, the symbolic pattern of the Japanese Paulownia flower was embroidered on the chest of judicial robes, signifying that a judge was appointed by Japan’s Emperor.
In 1953, Chief Justice Kim Byung-ro introduced a new judicial robe with a pattern of the Rose of Sharon.
The current judicial robe, adopted in 1998, emphasizes integrity.


People seldom replace their wigs, because the more it has faded, the more judicial experience one has.

Despite people’s dissatisfaction with the inconvenience and unsanitary features of wigs, however, the tradition has stayed strong for over 300 years as far as criminal trials are concerned.
