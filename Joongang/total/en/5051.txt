This started a debate on how to protect the vast sums child stars earned, and in the U.S.  the state of California passed a law that at least 15 percent of the money earned by a child actor must be managed through a trust fund by a third party until the child becomes an adult.
It is still called the “Jackie Coogan law.”
The law regulates not only money, but also the other rights of child actors, such as education and filming time.
The actors who starred in the “Harry Potter” series could not stay on set for more than 9 hours and 30 minutes per day, and had to spend 3 hours out of the 9 hours and 30 minutes studying with a teacher hired by the film company.


Actors Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, 10, and Rubiana Ali, 9, who are from the poverty-stricken area of Mumbai where the film is set, received a thunderous round of applause at the Oscars.

Jackie Coogan, who became a star at the age of 7 in the Charlie Chaplin film “The Kid”’ in 1921, sued his mother and stepfather when he turned 21 for frittering away the $4 million he had earned as a child actor.
