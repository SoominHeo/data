Everyone criticizes them, but the broadcasting company is not going to budge because the TV program has ratings around the 40 percent mark, and attracts a loyal fan base appealing to advertisers.
Some defenders even say, “Shakespeare’s plays include so-called ‘dead ends,’ too.”
In some ways, this is true.
Richard from “Richard III” impudently proposes to the woman whose husband he killed, and proposes to his niece, despite being cursed 
In other plays people cannot differentiate between male and female twins (“Twelfth Night”), and a tragedy occurs due to a mysterious drug that makes a person appear dead (“Romeo and Juliet”).
I am not saying we should expect more from a TV drama when similar contrivances are found even in the classics.
Putting everything else aside, let’s look at when Shakespeare wrote: from the end of the 16th to the beginning of the 17th century, around the same time the old Korean novel “The Story of Hong Gil-dong” was written.
In other words, “dead-end dramas” regress our entertainment standards by 400 years.
