Some market players and experts are calling for the authorities to step in to moderate the won’s plunge after it broke the 1,500 won barrier, while others talk of another downturn in the making.
Both the call for government’s hand in the currency market and reckless talk of a crisis only add to the market unrest.
Making hasty moves and snap judgments every time the won so much as twitches only aggravates the volatility in the currency markets.
The won’s latest downward spiral is mostly driven by the dollar’s strengthening amid broad fears of insolvencies in global markets, rather than by domestic factors.
There are no recent indicators that point to a deterioration in the Korean economy’s fundamentals or its outlook.
Thus, once the uncertainties in the global market calm down, so will the won?dollar exchange rate.
On the other hand, if market anxiety continues, the period of a comparatively devalued won may drag on.
Either way, financial authorities cannot afford to pour out dollar reserves in order to ease the won’s fall in the midst of the strong dollar trend.
It would be a losing game for the authorities if they step in at this stage with anything more than smoothing the market.
They should restrain from placing bets with currency reserves, which would be a sure loss.
But that doesn’t mean authorities should stay out of the game altogether.
They should closely watch the market and jump in to stabilize the market if and when necessary.
Korea has $200 billion in its currency coffers.
