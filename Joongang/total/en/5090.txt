The right to enter the conclave of cardinals that elects the pope is now limited to those under the age of 80.

The last papal conclave was convened in April 2005 and elected Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as the 265th pope with 84 out of 114 votes.

It would stand to reason that we can now voice the need to fill the void that he has left with a third cardinal.
