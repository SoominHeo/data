Seoul maintains that whatever Pyongyang launches, a satellite or a missile, it would be violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which prohibits North Korea from developing missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
The problem can be elevated to an international legal dispute if North Korea maintains that it has merely launched a satellite.
In the worst-case scenario, the U.S. can shoot down a long-range missile aimed at its territory, as Defense Secretary Robert Gates has warned.

Airborne threats are not the only concern for South Korean military officials.
North Korea has increased naval activities along the western sea border.
Defense Minister Lee Sang-hee said Seoul was readying for North Korean provocations near sea and land borders.
He said he has given authority to field commanders to take necessary action, hinting that military clashes were possible.

The two allies must coordinate their plans to encompass the worst-case scenario of a North Korean missile launch and an attack on South Korean territory, and reconfirm their joint stance and efforts to denuclearize the North Korean regime.
