When the National Assembly opened in February, the committee started to review the bill, voted for it on Thursday morning and submitted it to the plenary session of the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon.
In the plenary meeting, a ruling party legislator opposed the bill, calling it the worst of the worst of bills due to hasty  deliberations.
Besides that lawmaker, many ruling party members either voted against the bill or abstained even though the government and the ruling party had agreed to push it through.
This makes people wonder what went wrong with the governing party which has the responsibility to govern state affairs.
A revised bill should be passed in a special session at the National Assembly in April, at least for the 2,000 new law students who feel anxious over an unclear future.


The bill would have served as a guideline to decide curricula for law schools which are set to open in three months.

It was last October that the government gave advance notice of the proposed act and held a hearing before sending the bill to the judiciary committee.
