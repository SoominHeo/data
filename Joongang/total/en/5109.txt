The intelligence authorities have evidence that missile launching equipment was positioned, after an object suspected to be a Taepodong-2 was moved to a missile base in Musudan-ri, Hwadae County, in North Hamgyeong Province.

Are there government measures to cope with a national security crisis if Pyongyang launches a Taepodong-2 missile and Washington shoots it down?
