A high-ranking member of the labor group tried to rape a member of the teachers’ union, but the two organizations are trying to hide the case from the public.
The teachers’ organization fervently protested when a headmaster ordered a female teacher to make coffee.

They shout slogans but neglect their principles, which is worse than a woman who picks the best possible husband, even if it means marrying two men at once.
Before talking about grand ideologies, the two organizations must get their morals in place.
