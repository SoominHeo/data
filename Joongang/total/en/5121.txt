Professor Lewis Terman, a prominent scholar on the study of intelligence, in 1920 embarked on a landmark study on 1,500 children with an intelligence quotient, or IQ, of over 150, by following their childhood and adulthood over a span of 70 years.
Terman discovered that children with exceptional intelligence and their later achievements were highly unrelated.
But Boston College professor Ellen Winner argued that Terman’s observations were limited.
She argued that children with unusual prowess needed a “challenging” education.
