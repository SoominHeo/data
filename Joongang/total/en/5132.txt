The public is calling for cooperation in the face of the worst ever economic recession but instead the confederation announced a resolution on Jan. 21 for all-out confrontation against the government, stating that it is unhappy with government policies, including its dealing with non-regular work issues.

An emergency committee spanning labor unions, employers and the private and public sectors was launched yesterday to discuss unemployment issues, but the confederation went ahead and announced a full strike in June, making unrealistic demands including the stoppage of public sector works.

January exports fell 32 percent compared to a year ago and the number of entrepreneurs, an economic indicator for the have-nots, is plunging.

One solution to surging unemployment is for the confederation and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions to jointly devise guidelines to maintain jobs.
