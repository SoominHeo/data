When in 2005 it was announced that Oliver Smoot had retired from the position of chairman of the American National Standards Institute, the Internet search behemoth Google adopted smoot as a unit of measurement and calculation.
MIT held a memorial ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of smoot, inviting Oliver Smoot to attend the ceremony in October last year.
American society is undermining young people’s courage and romanticism with stereotypes, legends, history and knowledge.
In this context, we can understand why Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in his commencement address at Stanford University in 2005, “Stay foolish.”
Jobs confessed that he had gained an invaluable lesson from his own choices made wholly according to his curiosity and intuition, remembering that he had quit school but would sit in on classes.

We hardly find a vital personality among young people who break away from the herd and set out on their own.

George Smoot will give a lecture at Ewha Womans University from the first semester this year, according to the university’s project that invites the world’s top scholars to the school.
