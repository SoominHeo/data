The following story finds three bedbugs fighting over a hog.

The three glared at the stranger, growling, â€œWe are fighting for the best spot.

The three finally grasped the situation: Not only would their dinner soon be gone, but in the midst of feasting on the hog, they would be burned.

Humbled, the three bedbugs heeded the advice of their wise friend, and began to cooperate.
