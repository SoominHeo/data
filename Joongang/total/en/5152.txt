In remarks after a memorial service for Obuchi, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said his Japanese counterpart left a legacy of touching many hearts by making more than 50 calls a day to people he didnâ€™t know.
Clinton had been a fan of phone-calling politics as well.
He would personally call Republican Party members to cajole them into supporting contentious bills.
Clinton also left office with a higher approval rating than the level he started with.
President Barack Obama carries on the legacy.
The New York Times revealed that Republican party members have received more phone calls from the Obama team than the former Bush administration.
Obama has reportedly called more than 10 opposition Republican Party members to personally seek legislative support for new policies.
