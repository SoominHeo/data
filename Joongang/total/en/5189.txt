Reform should come in two areas ??
the Assembly system and the mentality of lawmakers.
The advisory committee recommends reinforcement of the Assembly speaker’s authority by extending his term to four years and empowering him to decide on lawmaking timetables if the ruling and opposition parties fail to agree.

Regulations need to be revised and overhauled.


The advisory committee recommends reinforcement of the Assembly speaker’s authority by extending his term to four years and empowering him to decide on lawmaking timetables if the ruling and opposition parties fail to agree.

Its suggestion on easing the requirement of 20 seats in order to gain negotiating status should be considered after the next elections.
