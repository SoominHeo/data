There are 7,000 to 8,000 languages spoken around the world, but the official languages of the United Nations are Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and French.

When leaders around the world get together in the United Nations, only these six languages are used for communication.

As a foreigner, I was more attracted to hangul, the writing system, than the Korean language at first.
