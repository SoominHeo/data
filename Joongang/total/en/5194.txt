To do that, a majority of the 172 GNP lawmakers should have come together in unity.
However, whereas members of the opposition Democratic Party literally tied themselves together with rope, GNP members went their separate ways in the face of opposition.
At the root of the friction is a feud between Lee and Park.
During the presidential election, Lee received a great deal of help from Park and pledged that she would get her due.
But that hasnâ€™t happened yet.
This meant that the pro-Park faction felt betrayed in the nomination process prior to the general elections.
Lee met with Park in May, following the elections, but they failed to narrow their differences.
