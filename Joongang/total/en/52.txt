Next year, the 2nd Infantry Division is to relocate to Pyeongtaek.
The human shield that guaranteed the involvement of Uncle Sam in case of a North Korean attack on the capital will no longer be in place.
In that case, China may oppose the North’s use of nuclear weapons more than the United States, purely out of concern for Chinese tourists.
But Chinese investment could also serve as a shield.
In 2013, China’s direct investment in Korea was $480 million, less than one-seventh of U.S. investment.
But last year, it increased to $1.97 billion.
Now, it is over one-third of U.S. investment of $5.47 billion and is rapidly growing.
