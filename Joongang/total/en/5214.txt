The two always rose early in the morning for training to prepare for war.
One day, one of the warriors wrote to the other, “I lay on my spear to wait for the morning sun ... in fear that I would keep you, my friend, waiting.”


The musician Kim Dong-jin wrote the music and Kim Young-sam penned the lyrics around 1952.

The phrase “Lying on a spear waiting for the dawn” arose from the friendship between two comrades in the Western Jin Dynasty.
