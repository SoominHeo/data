Less than one year later, a harsh winter has begun for us following the global economic turmoil.

In 2009, Korea will be plagued by the following five pains: low economic growth, export reduction, bankruptcy, higher unemployment and shrinking household spending.

The economies of the United States, Europe, China and Japan, which have been the major export markets for Korea, are shrinking faster than at first thought.

2009 should be the year for yielding tangible results in South-North Korean relations.

The government should accept agreements forged at the inter-Korean summit talks and strive to persuade the North to better appreciate the projects between the two Koreas.
