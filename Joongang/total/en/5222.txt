At the order by Qin Shi Huang to find the elixir of life, Xu Fu led 3,000 boys and girls on a journey to the eastern seas.
But the exact route of his journey remains unknown.
“Shiji” or “The Records of the Grand Historian,” states that Xu Fu was headed for the Three Sacred Peaks and settled down in an area with a vast field and wetlands without giving a specific name to the area.
In Korea, it has been said that Xu Fu went down to Jeju Island.
On the cliff of Jeongbang Waterfall in Seogwipo, Jeju Island, inscribed in Chinese characters is “Xu Shi passes by this place.”
Xu Shi is another name for Xu Fu.
Some maintain that the name of Seogwipo originated by the fact that Xu Fu came to Jeongbang Waterfall and returned westward.
In 2003, Jeju Island’s authorities built the Xu Fu Museum and the Xu Fu Park there.

If all participants of the meeting recall the history of exchange in the three countries through Xu Fu, minor conflicts or misunderstandings will be solved easily.
