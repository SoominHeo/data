A maintenance project affecting four major rivers starts today, beginning with seven preliminary construction efforts in areas including the Nakdong River/Andong and Yeongsan River/Naju.

The four rivers project is foremost a civil engineering project aimed at preventing flood damage and drought.

We hope that the government will form a task force to supervise the development of the four major rivers and present a plan that the people can agree with.
