Although the measure is belated, it has finally decided that the Bank of Korea will invest 10 trillion won, the Korea Development Bank 2 trillion won and institutional or ordinary investors, 8 trillion won.
This will protect banks’ soundness from problems that might emerge with the looming downturn in the real economy and in the course of restructuring.
According to the FSC, if the entire 20 trillion won fund is provided to banks, domestic banks’ BIS ratio, which was 10.86 percent as of the third quarter this year, will go up by 2.65 percent.
