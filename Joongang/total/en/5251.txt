The government said it intends to clean up four major rivers and the opposition parties call it preliminary work to begin building a grand canal.

Park reportedly asked President Lee, “Why don’t we announce that we will clean up the four rivers but that we won’t build a grand canal?” The Blue House acknowledged what Park said but insisted the president did not respond to Park.

In June, President Lee said in a press conference when the country was in turmoil due to protests over the resumption of U.S. beef imports, “If our countrymen do not want a grand canal, I will not build it.”
