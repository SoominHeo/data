Whatever the reasons may be, there is nothing to justify the dangerous level of verbal abuse now being hurled among online users from the three countries.
When antipathy intensified ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games between Chinese youths and Korean supporters of Tibet, their governments stepped in to cool the atmosphere.
They agreed on the need for more cultural exchanges among the youth to clear and prevent misunderstanding about one another.
It is high time for leaders of the three countries to come together to find ways to help the young break away from the pitfalls of historical nationalism and instead take the path of friendship and companionship.

The latest sporting event involving two of the most beloved sports stars in Korea and Japan has rekindled the war of words between Internet users of the two countries.

Every time politically and historically sensitive issues - Chinaâ€™s Northeast Asia project, the dispute over Dokdo and Japanese history textbooks, to name a few - the Internet becomes an ugly, defamatory war zone for online posters from the three historically intertwined nations.

Web services joined in by providing automatic translations of antagonistic Web sites and Internet comments, aggravating hostility and outrage among young Internet surfers in the three countries.
