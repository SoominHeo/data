Pompeii was completely buried during a catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
The city was lost for nearly 1,700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748.
Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into life at the height of the Roman Empire.
Of particular interest is the warning, “Cave Canem,” which adorns many ancient dog mosaics at the thresholds where houses open to the streets.
The Latin Cave Canem means “Beware of the dog.”
It was long ago that domesticated dogs began to live with humans.
The earliest fossil of what is believed to be one of the first domesticated dogs was found along with human remains in a cave in the Middle East, about 14,000 years ago.
Recently, however, some scientists said that the world’s first dog lived with humans 30,000 years ago or even earlier, since remains of a dog thought to be 31,700 years old were discovered in a cave in Belgium.
Experts estimate that dogs were domesticated from wolf ancestors in East Asia about 15,000 years ago, based on DNA analysis of more than 500 dog species worldwide.
