Prince Yangneong of the Joseon Dynasty, King Taejong’s firstborn son, was unseated in 1418, but his post-dethronement enterprise was often the talk of the court.
Yangneong was a lively and carefree character.
In a memo to the king in 1420, he was reported as “spending time drinking, hunting and enjoying bakhyeok” by a government agency that gathered information about political affairs and human resources.
