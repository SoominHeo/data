One year has passed and the opposition parties are demanding that Lee keep the promise.
A Blue House official said the presidential office is listening to public opinion to decide how to make the contribution.
The president’s donation could be a very effective political maneuver at this point.
While 30 billion won ($21.5 million) is a relatively small amount in terms of state affairs, it is everything Lee owns.
Therefore, keeping the promise will have a symbolic meaning to show the president’s honesty and sincerity to the nation.
First, Lee must again make public his strong intention to contribute his wealth to society to win the public’s trust.
