The U.S. is certainly not poised to officially give the North nuclear power status, given that the six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the country, which Washington is also a part of, are currently under way.
The report may also be only a part of American contingency efforts to gird for possible nuclear threats from the North, which is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons since its contentious nuclear test in October 2006.
It may only be a reflection of the U.S. governmentâ€™s perception that a nuclear war may erupt in the 2030s, not an official acknowledgement that North Korea can officially operate nuclear programs.
