The Korea National Council on Social Welfare conferred the title of Citizen Hero for the first time this year to ordinary people, the same folks we run into daily in our neighborhoods, such as a college student, a housewife, a cab driver and a company employee.

A housewife said she would help others instead of going out to a restaurant on her birthday and donated 100,000 won.
