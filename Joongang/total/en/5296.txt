The Vatican, which strictly respects life, adopted a declaration on euthanasia in 1980.
It maintains that in some cases giving up life can be more ethical than an obsessive act of delaying death.
Now it is time for our society to openly discuss euthanasia.
According to a survey conducted by the National Cancer Center, seven out of 10 Koreans approve of passive euthanasia, but it is nonetheless regarded as a taboo subject to talk about openly.
