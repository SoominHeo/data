The history of the U.S. presence in Guantanamo Bay dates back to the Spanish?American War in 1899.
The U.S. assumed perpetual territorial control over the harbor under the 1903 Cuban?American Treaty for its role in helping Cuba gain independence from Spain.
Under the treaty, the U.S. can lease the 116-square-kilometer (45-square-mile) area - nearly twice the size of Manhattan Island - for $4,000 per year for naval use as long as it wants to.
The Cuban government has repeatedly demanded return of its land since the 1959 Cuban Revolution, but Washington wasn’t ready to part with its oldest naval base.

A critical portrayal of prison conditions had already been depicted in the 1992 Rob Reiner film “A Few Good Men” that recounts a murder case among fellow Marines in the U.S. Guantanamo naval base.
