The government on Nov. 3 revealed a revised budget draft that outlined plans to strengthen social welfare, but the amount of money to be committed was lacking, as was the content of the bill.
Of the 14 trillion won [$9.38 billion] support budget, direct spending on things such as job loss compensation was raised by only 608.8 billion won ($405 million).
Even as we face the worst-ever job market meltdown since the 1997 financial crisis, the government merely increased spending on creating new jobs by 47 billion won.
