A recent survey of 1,139 teenage athletes by the National Human Rights Commission revealed that athletes at middle and high schools constantly suffer verbal and physical abuse from their coaches and seniors.
Eight out of 10 respondents said they were beaten by coaches or seniors and six out of 10 said they were sexually assaulted.
One female student who responded to the survey even tried to committee suicide because of constant beating by her seniors.
