Yesterday 200 universities released their requirements for regular admission for the 2009 academic year.
Students and their parents will estimate how the students preformed in the recent College Scholastic Ability Test and decide which universities to apply to.
For this year’s regular admissions, the CSAT’s weight in the process has been significantly increased.
Last year, only 11 universities had a system to select students based only on their CSAT scores, compared to 71 this year.

While this is partly due to a change in the scoring system, it also shows that universities are still obsessed with scores, allowing one student get in while another fails with only one or two points’ difference between the two.

Last year, 10 universities implemented it and this year 12 universities introduced it for the process of accepting students for the autumn term.
