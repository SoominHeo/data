The G-20 financial summit of leaders from the worldâ€™s largest economies, which was held in Washington, ended last Saturday after adopting a historic joint statement on reforming global financial markets.

The prominence of emerging economies was one of the most remarkable changes in this meeting.

As the leaders of the G-20 have already agreed to open the door of the FSF - which consists of 12 nations, including the G-7 - to the economic bloc of emerging economies, we should not miss this opportunity.
