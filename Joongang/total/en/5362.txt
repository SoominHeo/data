The Democratic Party of Korea opposes the deal for two reasons.
First, it argues that measures to protect industries that will be hurt by the free trade pact must be prepared.
Second, it also argues that the U.S. administration hasn’t sent the bill to Congress yet and the U.S. government and Congress won’t give the deal more weight because Korea handles it first.
In short, National Assembly approval is needed but now is not the right time, according to the opposition party.
But from a comprehensive point of view, there won’t be any harm done even if Korea’s National Assembly approves it first.
Unlike the U.S., Korea must adjust 20 free-trade related laws, and therefore it takes longer to finally approve the trade deal.


The government and the ruling party plan to submit a bill to that effect on Nov. 10 to the National Assembly’s committee of foreign affairs and trade.
