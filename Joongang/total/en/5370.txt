The Zimbabwean government decided to slaughter 6,000 animals per annum starting this year to control the elephant population, which is likely to be as high as 100,000 animals now.
It plans to dry and sell elephant meat as a way of making use of the countryâ€™s burgeoning elephant population.
South Africa started the slaughter of elephants in May on a selective basis, as the number of elephants in its territory has more than doubled from 8,000 in 1994.
African countries have stored ivory from slaughtered elephants, calling for the Convention secretariat to allow the international sale of elephant ivory.
In July this year, Cites accredited China as a potential bidder for a one-off auction of ivory totaling 108 tons from four southern African nations: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
However, more than 20,000 African elephants are now estimated to be killed every year.
