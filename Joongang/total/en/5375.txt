The number of children from international families has gradually increased, now at 58,000.
If they grow up without proper education, they could be disadvantaged in the workplace and in marriage.
In 2005, adolescents from immigrant families rioted in Paris, and the same year, immigrant families got involved in terrorist bombings in London.
These young adults were French or British citizens but they were discriminated against and expressed their frustration through violence.
If children from mixed-culture families continue to be regarded as second-class citizens, the future of our society might be gloomy.
