The National Assembly will conduct an investigation of the rice farm subsidy issue on Nov. 10 to 26.

Some 170,000 people are suspected to have received the subsidies, of whom around 46,000 are civil servants or public corporation employees.

Hearings are important but with 18 members in the special committee, there is a risk that the inspection will be superficial if the committee is not efficient.
