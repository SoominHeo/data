The weather is so important in drying pollack that people say it is a joint task, on a ratio of 7:3, between God and humans.

Pollack thrive in the cold currents near the Bering Sea and Kamchatka Peninsula, then follow the currents to the East Sea in the fall to stay until March the following year.

As a result, Russia announced last week that it would increase our fishing quota for pollack in Russian waters by 7,000 tons.
