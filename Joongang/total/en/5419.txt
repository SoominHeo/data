G-20 members agreed on Oct. 11 that “all possible means will be mobilized to prevent and resolve the global financial crisis.”
It is now the time to come up with concrete means and methods.
As Strategy and Finance Minister Kang Man-soo suggested, alternatives will include a measure to expand national currency swap operations to major emerging market economies, and Japan’s suggestion that the foreign currency reserves of countries with a trade surplus should be used as support funds in cases of emergency.
Active participation by developed nations, including the United States, is essential to the success of any international cooperation measures.
The G-7 bears the biggest responsibility in this financial crisis, and should therefore play a pivotal role.


In particular, following the G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting, a G-20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 nations is being held to come up with alternatives and solutions for tackling the current crisis.

We welcome the fact that the G-20 meeting is actively engaged in building an international cooperation system in an effort to resolve the global credit crisis, and expect that they will develop a concrete plan to accomplish that vision.
