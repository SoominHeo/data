It may have been burdensome for the Bush administration to shake itself free of North Korea’s threat to stop its denuclearization process and halt the six-party talks.
And it would be difficult to let everything achieved so far - the freezing of North Korea’s nuclear program and steps toward denuclearization - to go to waste after so much effort.
Even so, backing off after having firmly proclaimed that it would not remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism unless all of North Korea’s nuclear facilities were thoroughly verified is the result of a lack of strategy.
The next U.S. administration should learn from this failure.
Our government is welcoming this step taken by the United States.
This is hardly surprising as resuming the six-party talks and seeing progress in North Korea-U.S. relations will help stabilize the Korean Peninsula.
