In 1970, an unknown American psychologist conducted an experiment to test this.
David Rosenhan and seven of his friends went to psychiatric hospitals all over the United States and falsely declared, “I hear voices and thudding sounds.”

According to the article, “Intensive psychoanalytic therapy, the ‘talking cure’ rooted in the ideas of Freud, has all but disappeared in the age of drug treatments and managed care.
But now researchers are reporting that the therapy can be effective against some chronic mental problems, including anxiety and borderline personality disorder.”
The study, based on more than 1,000 patients, was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Friday.
It is particularly welcoming to read of effective depression treatments, as more than 2.5 percent of South Koreans suffer from depressive disorders according to data disclosed Monday.
The return of psychoanalytic therapy must be proof that it has developed more effective methods after Rosenhan’s attack.


David Rosenhan and seven of his friends went to psychiatric hospitals all over the United States and falsely declared, “I hear voices and thudding sounds.”

Three months later, the hospital proudly declared that they had found 41 such patients.

The Internet version of the New York Times on Oct. 1 carried the story “Psychoanalytic Therapy Wins Backing.”
