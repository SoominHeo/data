As of July 1, citizens aged 65 or over account for more than 10 percent of the entire population, the National Statistical Office said.

This means that the generation being born now will have to spend one-third of their income in supporting seniors when they become adults.

Insurance plans for seniors were introduced in July but supply is scarce relative to demand.
