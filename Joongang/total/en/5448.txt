Through supercomputers, researchers calculated that two neutron stars colliding into each other will explode to form a black hole.
At that time, iron and nickel absorb the neutron elements which are transformed into gold and platinum, thanks to a 1 billion degree heat and enormous density.

Yet people remain obsessed by gold.
Approximately 60 percent of the worldâ€™s total gold volume is possessed by governments and central banks.
Gold is money.


Our universe was created by a huge explosion about 14 billion years ago.

Through supercomputers, researchers calculated that two neutron stars colliding into each other will explode to form a black hole.

At that time, iron and nickel absorb the neutron elements which are transformed into gold and platinum, thanks to a 1 billion degree heat and enormous density.

However, such a phenomenon can occur only once every 100,000 years in the universe.
