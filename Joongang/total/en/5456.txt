The government is attempting to resuscitate the financial sector, which is suffering from a foreign currency shortage, by pouring in $10 billion in exchange equalization funds.
This emergency measure aims to deal with the dire lack of dollars at domestic financial companies which are unable to borrow foreign currency as a result of the U.S. financial crisis.
However, the exchange equalization fund is only a stopgap measure and not a fundamental solution to the foreign currency shortage.
Lehman Brothersâ€™ insolvency drastically exacerbated the foreign currency situation, but our shortage of foreign capital is not new.
After the U.S. subprime crisis began, international credit began to tighten and things worsened starting this year.
As international credit tightens, domestic financial companies that have a weak credit rating and poor ability to borrow foreign currency will face a foreign currency crisis.
This does not mean that we can supply dollars to the tiny domestic foreign currency market.
After the crisis emerged, foreign investors left the Korean market, exacerbating the dollar shortage.
This shows a real vulnerability on the part of the domestic foreign currency market and financial companies to a foreign currency crisis.
This led to skyrocketing interest rates in dollar borrowing and the most unfavorable won-dollar exchange rate in four years.
