On Feb. 11, North Korea issued a Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland statement, stating, “It is foolish to think the breakdown of the industrial park would effect North Korea’s nuclear armament.”
President Park Geun-hye responded in her National Assembly speech on Feb. 16 by saying “Shutting down the Kaesong Complex is only the beginning of measures that South Korea will take along with the international community,”.
