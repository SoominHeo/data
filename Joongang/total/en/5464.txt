Public union representatives joined the committee in June, and the reform plan since softened significantly.
As a result, there is criticism that the reform discussion was left to public employees while the Ministry of Public Administration and Security played the role of referee, despite the fact that they are going to be most affected by it.
It is difficult to understand the argument of public employees that they need to get higher pension payouts after they retire than the general public.
They do not work more than those employed in the private sector, nor are they more competitive.
Moreover, the government is making up for pension losses with tax money.
The compensation amounts to 3 trillion won ($2.6 billion) so far and is expected to top 30 trillion won in the next 10 years.
Under the reform plan, the government will have to continue to support retired public employees with tax money.
The Ministry of Public Administration and Security intends to submit a legislative revision proposal based on the plan to the National Assembly this fall.
There is still time.
There needs to be more discussion on the issue through public hearings.
The public employee pension system should eventually be absorbed by the national pension.
This is the global trend.
The two-year-long public employee-led discussion on the reform has reached its limit.
