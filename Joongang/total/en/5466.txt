David Levy, a British artificial intelligence researcher, presented a paper last year claiming, “In 50 years, humans could marry robots.”

The electric-powered robot could walk - although not smoothly - and say 77 recorded words.

Robots resembling people appeared in 2005 at the Japanese Robot Mania World Exposition in Aichi.
