Five organizations, including the Seoul office of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union and an organization of parents advocating egalitarianism-oriented education, have formed a civic group against student evaluation tests.
They’re planning outdoor activities for students on the days when the evaluations are scheduled to take place, Oct. 8, 14 and 15.
