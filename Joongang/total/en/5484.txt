The novel was translated into five languages and swept Europe as the phenomenon of “Werther fever.”
Men wore the same clothes that Werther wore; yellow vest and pants, blue coat and burgundy boots.
Women wore Lotte’s white dress with a red band around the sleeves and neck, and wore a perfume named Werther.
The danger of this fever arose when suicides, mimicking Werther, grew increasingly in vogue among the youth.
The sensational novel was found on the desk of a youngster who shot himself to death and in the pocket of another young man who drowned himself.
Goethe, who became rich and famous thanks to the novel, lamented, “This small book is highly influential, almost like a monster.”
 Two hundred years later in 1974, an American sociologist, David Phillips, coined the term “Werther effect.”
