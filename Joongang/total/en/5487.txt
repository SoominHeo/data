The Union general was known for insisting on “unconditional surrender,” as he refused to conduct any negotiations and pushed to take 12,000 Confederate soldiers captive.
Last year, the letter that Lincoln wrote immediately after the Battle of Gettysburg was released to the public.
It said, “Arrest General Lee quickly.
Annihilate the enemy soldiers.”
Resentment, accumulated through the years, poured out in his letter.
However, the atmosphere at the surrender negotiations told a different story.
People were surprised to see the draft negotiating texts released by Grant.
“Throw away weapons and return to your hometown.
Farmers may ride a horse on the way home.”
The document contained no mention of war criminals and prisoners.
The defeated troops found themselves on emergency rations.
General Lee, prepared for death, was astonished as previously held grudges disappeared into thin air.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has reportedly collapsed.
It is necessary to map out emergency plans in the event that the communist country collapses.
However, we have to outlive grudges and hostility with tolerance, humility and grace.
Fortunately, America was not spiritually severed in two, thanks to Grant’s determination.
