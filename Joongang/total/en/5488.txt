But only five months later, the Berlin Wall collapsed.
There is no guarantee that the same won’t happen to North Korea.
If so, North Korea’s case will shock the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.
Its effects will be incomparable to those from the emergency in East Germany.
North Korea has nuclear weapons and a militarized population while its economy has fallen to a bottomless pit.
Therefore, it is unbelievable that some maintain we should be careful not to upset North Korea.
Do they mean that we should just sit still just to have talks with North Korea while neglecting the survival of South Korea?
There is also the question of China and its interests.
In case of an emergency in North Korea, South Korea has no power to intervene in North Korea.
But the United States is ready to intervene on its own, if need be.
In 2005, the commander of the U.S. 7th squadron said that if something happens to the security situation in North Korea, it would go in and help restore order.
