Moreover, as SNU has declared intentions of hiring 100 non-Korean professors, it believes that applying international standards to professor evaluations is only sensible.
It is worth noting that the professors themselves have accepted the new measures.
Many initially said that it was too drastic a change.
However, their attitudes have changed, and they are now responding positively.

Other universities must follow suit.
Last year, the Korean Advanced Institute for Science and Technology rejected the tenure applications of 15 professors.


In the spring term this year, many of its professors did not make tenure for the first time since the founding of the school, shocking the entire university.

The tenure evaluation committee has two members from foreign universities as well as faculty members.
