Google, the world’s top Internet search engine, yesterday laid out an ambitious plan to bridge the digital gap across the global community by providing free wireless Internet connections for 3 billion people with no access to cyberspace.

Google, which was founded in 1998 under the mission to “compile a massive index of all the words it sees and their location on each page” on the Internet, is already, in effect, playing the role of a “world government.”
