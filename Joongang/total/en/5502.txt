The U.S. Department of the Treasury, notorious for its two-faced Janus traits, openly pointed the finger at a foreign country in financial crisis.

The Treasury decided last Sunday to spend public funds of more than $200 billion on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, possibly beginning a new measure of nationalization.

“The bankruptcy of these two giant companies might lead to a collapse of the financial system due to their huge scale,” he said.

They awaited the normalization of these two companies while paying emergency funds skillfully.
