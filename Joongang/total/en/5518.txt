Yesterday, a state of emergency was imposed in Bangkok eight days after anti-government protesters occupied the government compound.

The conflict raging today could have been avoided if Thaksin, who took power in 2001 thanks to overwhelming support of the poor and the those living in rural areas, had tried to unite his country.

In 2006, accused of abuse of power and corruption, Thaksin was ousted in a coup, the 17th in 76 years of constitutionalism in Thailand, and fled abroad.

The People’s Alliance for Democracy, a civic organization leading the anti-government protests, maintains that a democratic system based on one person, one vote doesn’t suit Thailand.
