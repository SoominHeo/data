The government’s reasoning on the so-called September financial crisis is convincing on its own term.
It is true that short-term foreign loans will expire this month, but money is not that likely to leave the country all at once.
Our interest rate is definitely not low compared to the United States, Europe and Japan.
The high oil prices are clearly dropping.
We should agree with the government that inflation and the capital deficit will be reduced.
Nonetheless, the strange story of what will happen in September is not going away because foreigners are selling Korean stocks in droves.

If the Chinese economy steps back, it is the same.
Protecting the economy, and not saving the economy, is more impending.
This is difficult with old Keynesian methods such as artificially intervening in the market with changes in the exchange rate and interest rate.
Such steps only temporarily cure symptoms.
Instead, we should take the right path.
We should let the economy run according to market principles with minimum government intervention.
The government should revive domestic demand and induce investment in plants and equipment through promised tax cuts and drastic regulation relaxation.
Even if it takes time, the best medicine is building the economy’s basic health.
We are more worried about the economy’s basic health than the so-called September crisis.
 

Nonetheless, the strange story of what will happen in September is not going away because foreigners are selling Korean stocks in droves.

The coincident composite index that shows the state of the current economy and the composite leading indicators that predict the future of the economy have both dropped for six months running.

If there is an oil shock or if two U.S. public mortgage companies collapse, we cannot guarantee the welfare of the Korean economy.
