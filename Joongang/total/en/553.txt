China’s defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 was a turning point, when China went from strong country to loser.
The cold perspective was enhanced during the Japanese colonial period, and Korea became condescending to China.
Then, the late-Qing reform movements and Xinhai Revolution led to the Chinese model theory.
The advocates of East Asia’s co-prosperity consider China as a balancer.
As China rises in the 21st century, its role as a balancer is highlighted.
However, these three views are what Korea wants to see from China.


North Korea’s fourth nuclear test and long-range missile are shaking the foundation of the Korea-China relations.

The three views, “loser,” “reform model” and “power balancer,” were formed at that time.

However, these three views are what Korea wants to see from China.

After the March 1 Independence Movement, China began to consider Korea a partner.

The mirror has emerged once again since the North’s nuclear test.
