Moon ignored all nine summonses sent from prosecutors before the Assembly convened last Tuesday.
Now that the Assembly is in session, Moon is insisting on his immunity from arrest.
According to prosecutors, Moon personally asked Lee for financial support.
However, Moon argues that Lee donated the money to the Creative Korea Party, not to Moon himself.
This is similar to how Pro-Park United Party Chairman Suh Chung-won received money from other Pro-Park United Representatives Yang Jeong-nye and Kim Noh-sik.
Suh was found guilty by the Seoul Central District Court.
The court said, “Suh completely ignored the idea of the election laws.”
Moon, who is a self-proclaimed champion of “clean politics,” should have already appeared before prosecutors to prove his stand as a “clean politician.”
It is now up to the Assembly to make a decision.
For the last 13 years, the Assembly has not approved the arrest of any fellow representatives suspected of wrongdoings.
