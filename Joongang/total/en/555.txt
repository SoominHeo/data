AlphaGo defeated Chinese-born European champion Fan Hui - a 2-dan player - in all five matches.
For every stone, the Go player chooses one of 250 possible places on average, and in a game, each player plays about 150 moves.

It is not so far away.
Fortunately, AlphaGo is under human control.
It has no function other than playing Go, and it cannot move the stones by itself and requires human assistance.
However, AlphaGo may be signaling the appearance of super artificial intelligence that can evolve on its own and can control robots, just like Skynet in “Terminator” or Ultron in “Avengers.”
Visionaries like physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla founder Elon Musk have already warned of the risk.
We can take comfort in the optimistic views of MIT Prof. Andrew McAfee, author of “The Second Machine Age.”
He believes humans may lose to robots, but humans who can use computers will never be dominated by robots.


For every stone, the Go player chooses one of 250 possible places on average, and in a game, each player plays about 150 moves.

AlphaGo makes each calculation in three seconds.

AlphaGo studies by playing actual games and reviewing past games, and its training is equivalent to what a human player can do in 1,000 years.
