Since its legalization in 1999, the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union has caused nothing but chaos to the Korean education system.
The union is wrapped up in its own egalitarianism and has continually opposed the diversification of schools, including the opening of elite education institutes.
It also has been involved in anti-government acts, including protests against the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement and the import of U.S. beef.
City education boards have announced that they will provide the union with subsidies for office rental and business overhead for the next 10 years.

Every month, the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union collects 0.8 percent of the monthly salaries of its 77,000 members.
