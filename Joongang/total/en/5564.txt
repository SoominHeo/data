The emperor, known for his scientific wisdom, believed that the safest way to drink water was by first boiling it.
One day the emperor mistakenly ate a poisonous plant, which left him writhing in pain.
Noticing that some dried leaves from a nearby bush had fallen into the boiling water, he decided to drink some and found it to be very refreshing.
And so, tea was created.
Many people believe that Asians have low tolerance for alcohol, which leads them to drink more green tea than alcohol.
They also suspect that Asians drink less alcohol than Europeans because they have an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) deficiency.
The truth is that nearly half of the people in Northeast Asian nations, such as Korea, China and Japan, are equipped with this enzyme.
ADH is responsible for catalyzing alcohol into acetaldehyde - the chemical that causes hangovers.
What they lack, however, is aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, the enzyme associated with the chemical transformation from acetaldehyde to harmless acetic acid.
