The nine members of the political standing committee of the Chinese Communist Party were wearing suits on the hot summer’s night, yet watched the ceremony looking remarkably cool.
In contrast, the foreign heads of state, gathered behind in a corner, were fanning themselves in the heat.
Some even said, “It looks as though the foreign leaders are paying tribute to the ancient Chinese emperor.”
Everything here is done the Chinese way.
Whether it is the closing off of Chang’an Avenue or changing the city’s look by splashing a huge amount of money over it for the Games, it is the same mentality.
Under the belief that it is the representative of Asian civilization, inviting leaders from abroad and having them sit in one corner is the Chinese way of expressing its self confidence.


One must pull into the side streets to be able to park.

How the 90 heads of state watched the opening ceremony was interesting.
