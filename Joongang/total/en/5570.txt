A one-year-old baby cries 65 times a month on average.
Once we become adults, we donâ€™t cry as much.
We tend to think first think about our social status and saving face.
However, when we experience extreme emotion, tears flow naturally as a physical response.
This is beneficial for our health as tears carry the stress hormone called catecholamine.
If this hormone accumulates in the body, we can have problems with digestion, the heart, hardening of the arteries and high cholesterol.
This is what happened when Princess Diana passed away in 1997.
