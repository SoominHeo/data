This is the first time since August last year that the bank has raised the benchmark rate.
Between stabilizing consumer prices and pursuing growth, the BOK chose the latter.
We believe this decision will be a burden in the near future, but it is the right decision to make from a long-term perspective.
When economic growth slows, consumption decreases and employment issues worsen.
It isnâ€™t easy to choose stability because a rise in the interest rate makes life tougher for companies and households and holds back growth.
This is why the BOK has hesitated over the past several months before it announced its decision.
However, as consumer prices surged to nearly a 10-year record high recently, the worry intensified that our economy is entering a period of stagflation in which prices are high but growth is slow.
