On July 10, Grand National Party lawmaker Park Hee-tae told the Blue House that the general feeling in the country was that sacking the deputy minister to keep Finance Minister Kang Man-soo in office was difficult to accept.

He was criticized last July for publicly endorsing, with other professors, Lee Myung-bakâ€™s presidential bid last year, while he was still president of Sungshin.
