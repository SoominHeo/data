In 1904, 30-year-old Syngman Rhee crossed the Pacific Ocean on a boat and travelled across the U.S. by train to arrive in Washington, D.C.

Even more so, considering that just five days before meeting Rhee, the United States and Japan had forged the Katsura-Taft Agreement where the U.S. had acknowledged Japanâ€™s role in Korea.

It was impossible for Syngman Rhee, who went to the United States for the first time relying on a few introductions from a missionary, to compete with and triumph over Kaneko from Harvard.

The U.S. position that it will keep its neutrality is also the same, and Japan is not likely to sit still for too long and will soon start a second round of battles.
