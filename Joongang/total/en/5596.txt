The MBC “Live in the morning” broadcast on July 29 again distorted and manipulated facts after “PD Diary’s” flawed reporting on mad cow disease.
During the broadcast, MBC interviewed police officer Lee Gil-jun, who had opposed suppressing the candlelight rallies and refused to return to the military.
There is a part in the broadcast where a member of the “Gathering of civilians who love police officers,” says, “My son went to the military to serve as a soldier and not to become a scarecrow of the government.”
The original statement, however, was made to refute a criticism made by demonstrators that police officers are government scarecrows.
MBC cut out this part and broadcast it as if it were a statement made to support officer Lee.
The interview was made on July 4 and 5, which was 20 days before Lee’s incident.
