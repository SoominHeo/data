He pushed the button on the fifth nuclear test regardless of his people’s plea for government support.
Kim went ahead with development of nuclear weapons amid the truly indescribable plight of his own people.
If he really wants to prove the veracity of his vow to promote the wellbeing of the North Korean people, Kim should have paid heed to their wounds, both mental and physical.

That’s why it is difficult for us to propose aid to North Koreans desperately in need of outside help.
Even civic groups in South Korea, which have been ardently advocating humanitarian aid under any circumstances, are increasingly reluctant to offer help to the North.

The World Food Program, the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger, has kicked off a campaign to offer emergency food to 140,000 flood victims in the North, not to mention the good work of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
