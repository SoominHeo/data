Calling past governments the First Republic or the Third Republic is a way of distinguishing different political systems.
This was borrowed from the French constitutional history’s way of distinguishing different periods.
Political systems changed several times in France after the 1789 Revolution ?

President Sarkozy is the sixth president of the Fifth Republic.
In South Korea, since the establishment of the country in 1948, we’ve always had republics, so it is misleading to number them as in France.

The government is claiming “the end of the Fifth Republic,” while the media labor unions and broadcasters are claiming “the recurrence of the Fifth Republic.”
For example, the government wants to return everything to before the Fifth Republic, since it was the Basic Media Law of 1980 that led to the problems of MBC’s ownership structure, KBS-2 TV and the Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corporation.
The government wants to discard the remnants of that law.


Political systems changed several times in France after the 1789 Revolution ?

In France, it is now the Fifth Republic since the rule of President de Gaulle in 1958.

President Sarkozy is the sixth president of the Fifth Republic.

In South Korea, since the establishment of the country in 1948, we’ve always had republics, so it is misleading to number them as in France.

After the June 10 upheaval, the presidential system changed from indirect to direct elections.

Recently, many are talking about the Fifth Republic.

The government is claiming “the end of the Fifth Republic,” while the media labor unions and broadcasters are claiming “the recurrence of the Fifth Republic.”

On the other hand, it is difficult for the government not to be criticized as the recurrence of the Fifth Republic, because of the appointment of personnel at YTN according to political lines.
