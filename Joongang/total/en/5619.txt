The Grand National Party seems too weak for a majority party that occupies 172 seats in the National Assembly.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the GNP’s first policy mediation committee suggested the other day that subsidies for a political party should be reduced if the GNP boycotts the National Assembly and that the act of occupying the main conference hall and the speaker’s seat in the National Assembly should be banned.

The GNP has probably forgotten how to  run state affairs as it took power after 10 years as the opposition.
