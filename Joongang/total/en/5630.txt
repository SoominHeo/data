Japan was granted the territory in 1876, a lucky benefactor of a dispute over the island between the United States and Great Britain.

Back in those days, Western whaleboats appeared in the East Sea frequently.
Since it was not hard to buy whale meat at the Busan fish market until recently, we can guess that many whales lived in the East Sea.
According to later Joseon Dynasty historical records such as the “Seungjeungwon Ilgi,” reports had been filed to the Royal Court that unidentified boats were appearing around Ulleung Island and the Dokdo islets.
One of the unidentified boats that sailed into the East Sea in 1849 was the French whaling boat named Liancourt, whose sailors first reported on Dokdo.


Nowadays international treaties have banned whaling but nearly one hundred years ago, whales were the most sought-after trade item.
