In the 2004 legislative elections when former President Roh Moo-hyun was in office, the Uri Party won the elections and formed a committee to pursue a meeting between the legislators of South and North Korea.
Shortly after the 2007 summit meeting with North Korea, then National Assembly Speaker Lim Chae-jung urged a meeting of legislators of South and North Korea to be held as soon as possible.
