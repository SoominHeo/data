The goal of the Korea Alliance for Progressive Movement, which was launched in September last year, was to carry out joint left-wing protests.
The alliance consists of some 30 organizations, including the Korean Farmers’ League, Democratic Labor Party, National Federation of Student Associations and the National Convention of Labor Union Members.
Before the candlelight vigils started, the organization planned anti-government protests using ordinary citizens.
The documents from January say, “Let’s create an excuse that can arouse public rage against the Lee administration and create a frontline of citizens to carry out the protests.”

The alliance planned and led illegal acts from early May.
They encouraged college students to boycott their classes, labor unions to join in the rallies, religious groups to wade in street marches.
