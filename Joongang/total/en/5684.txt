Some 360 people from a farmersâ€™ association decided to test-produce bioethanol from cheap rice that yields more, instead of high-quality rice.
This happened in Niigata, famous for being the origin of an expensive rice species called Gosihikari.
The Japanese government also plans to use parts of the 1.5 million tons of rice stored in case of a food crisis to produce ethanol.
