“Super Size Me,” a 2004 movie directed by Morgan Spurlock, warns of the danger of fast food.

Spurlock gained five kilograms in a week and suffered headaches, lethargy and depression.

While Super Size Me focused on fast food and health, “Fast Food Nation,” a 2006 movie that will be released here next month, penetrates the fast food industry.

The book was on The New York Times best-seller list for two years and the movie was nominated for the Palme d’Or at the 2006 Cannes film festival.

The film shows how a hamburger for less than $1 can be produced and environmental activists’ dreams are illusions.
