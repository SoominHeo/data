The turnout rate, however, was merely around 10 percent.
That is the result of a lack of interest in the election among parents and other citizens.
The election for the superintendent of education in Busan was held early last year, the first of its kind, but the turnout rate was just 15.3 percent.

 The post of education superintendent is key.
The success or failure of education in primary, middle and high schools depends on education superintendents.
They decide important educational affairs, such as opening new special high schools, changing school districts, planning different classes according to student ability, extracurricular matters and personnel affairs.
Superintendents have enormous power over budgets as well.
The superintendent of education in Seoul controls a budget of 6.167 trillion won ($5.9 billion), which is close to the budget for the entire city of Busan.
Because of the April 15 measure to give schools autonomy, education superintendents have more important roles than ever.

From July 2010, new superintendents will be elected again and they will have four-year terms, the same as the heads of districts.
Thus, it is understandable that some maintain it is a waste of taxpayer money to have direct elections.


Because of the April 15 measure to give schools autonomy, education superintendents have more important roles than ever.

A direct election costs from 10 billion won to 40 billion won, according to the size of a city or a province.
