This time, both governments guaranteed that U.S. beef from cattle over 30 months old cannot enter the Korean market.
Also, both governments agreed that even in imports of beef from cattle under 30 months old, the category of specified risk material that will be banned from imports will be broader.
They reportedly almost agreed in principle that the Korean government has the right  to approve or reject U.S. slaughterhouses that will butcher cattle for exportation to Korea.
Although the official announcement has not been made, the progress so far is viewed in an optimistic light.
It seems the U.S. beef controversy is nearing an end, with three key issues -Koreaâ€™s sovereign right to quarantine imported beef, banning import of beef from cattle 30 months or older and a broader category of specified risk material  being ironed out.
