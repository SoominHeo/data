The program titled “Is U.S. beef safe from mad cow disease?” was aired on April 29, sparking panic among Koreans here.
The program was full of overblown and distorted stories.
For instance, the program talked about an American woman who died from symptoms which were suspected to be those of the human variant of mad cow disease.
But it turned out that she didn’t have the disease, according to an official report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on June 12.
