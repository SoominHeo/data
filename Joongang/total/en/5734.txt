Even Tokugawa Ieyasu served as daijodaijin for just one month.
After Nobuhito’s refusal, it became a tradition in Japan that the post of daijodaihin remain vacant.
The Fujiwara family gained public support and succeeded in monopolizing political power, mainly because Nobuhito took a modest attitude.
The Fujiwara family prevailed in Japan for 1,200 years by continuing to marry into the Japanese royal family.


When former President Roh Moo-hyun served as the minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, he said, “There are only three ministers at the cabinet meeting who deserve respect.”

It is not a coincidence then that President Roh appointed Goh Kun as his first prime minister.

Japanese historians insist that their emperors came from one origin throughout their 1,500-year history.

However, Fujiwara Nobuhito (659-720) refused such a tempting post three times.
