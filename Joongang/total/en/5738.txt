Chung said he reported the problem to President Lee just before the April general elections.
Chung claims the president would not listen to him.
The president will have to clarify which of Chung’s claims are true.
Some indicate that the president doesn’t know what is happening right before his eyes.
President Lee should find out the truth and reflect it in the personnel reshuffle that is soon to take place.
Chung himself may be partly responsible.
As a close ally of the president, did he not interfere in personnel appointments as well Why did he keep his mouth shut if core members were meddling with the appointment of the cabinet in February?


Lawmaker Chung Doo-un of the Grand National Party is one of President Lee Myung-bak’s core aides.

In April, about 50 lawmaker hopefuls in the capital region, including Chung, demanded en masse that the president’s brother, Lee Sang-deuk, give up his nomination as party candidate for the legislative election.
