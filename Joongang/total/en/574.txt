There, he saw a glass box with 200 grams of plutonium, an ingredient for nuclear weapons.

The nuclear nonproliferation system cracked when the concerned parties took a geopolitical approach on the nuclear issue.
North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons is a strategic burden to all five nations and the core reason for joint action.

North Korea’s fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 harkens back to the old days, and whether or not it really involved a hydrogen bomb, Pyongyang’s nuclear capability is at the stage in which it is able to make nuclear weapons light and small.

It’s also unlikely that Pyongyang will remain quiet until May, when it is scheduled to hold its seventh Workers Party convention, and that poses a challenge for Seoul.

After North Korea’s latest nuclear test, Hecker - who has visited nuclear sites in North Korea seven times over the past decade - called for Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear facilities and suspend testing.

In order to prevent a fifth nuclear test and missile launch, a comprehensive approach with a long-term perspective should be tried.
