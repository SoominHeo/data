Unlike the time of the Korean War, the current 8th Army has transferred most of its major command roles over to the 2nd Army Division.
And now the Pentagon plans to merge the 8th Army with the army command headquarters for the Pacific region, aimed to minimize command structures and establish an extensive military command headquarters to cover the entire Pacific Ocean region, including the Korean Peninsula.

Nevertheless, the relocation of the 8th Army command headquarters, following the dismantling of the Korea-U.S.
Combined Forces Command, will pose a new threat to our national security.

The U.S. pledged to “respect” South Korea’s situation and stance, but there are ample possibilities that the two countries will interpret this differently from the very beginning.

Both Washington and Seoul claim that there will be no problem in the South’s deterrence against a possible threat from Pyongyang since the U.S. 2nd Army Division will still be here, and the 8th Army also returns to Korea for military emergencies.
