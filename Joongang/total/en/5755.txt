Among them were 11 Koreans, including Tak.
His soul now rests within the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where a picture of him in his flying helmet is displayed.
Last month, on the anniversary of Tak Kyong-hyong’s passing, several Japanese tried to build a monument in his honor in his hometown of Sacheon, South Gyeongsang.
They must have thought that the  memorial would be a small step toward the reconciliation of Korea and Japan, just like in the movie “Hotaru,” based on the Tak story.
In the movie, a Japanese survivor who was a subordinate of the Korean lieutenant in the Kamikaze corps visits Korea with a keepsake that belonged to his senior officer.
An emotional reconciliation is made as the family who at first strongly refused to accept the keepsake finally accepts it in the end.
