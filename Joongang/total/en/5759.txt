The Lee Myung-bak administration is facing a crisis only three months into its term.
Large-scale rallies continue to protest the resumption of U.S. beef imports, with demonstrators illegally blocking traffic in downtown Seoul.
On Thursday, when the government announced new quarantine restrictions that effectively open the Korean market to almost all U.S. beef cuts, 10,000 protesters gathered in Seoul and a total of 4,000 people participated in demonstrations in 12 major cities in the provinces.

Also, demonstrators in the street should ask themselves if it is right to demand the end of an administration that launched only three months ago.
