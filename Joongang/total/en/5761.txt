The Viking 1 and 2 were sent to explore Mars, 78 million kilometers (48.5 million miles) away from Earth, as part of NASA’s Viking program in 1975 and 1976, respectively, in order to find out whether aliens exist there, and transmit data back to Earth.

Mars’ average surface temperature is 53 degrees below zero, far lower than that of the Earth, which is a balmy 13 degrees above.
