The first reason was that resolutions for North Korea’s nuclear issue were not found.

Particularly in 2001, as the George W. Bush administration of the United States took a hard-line North Korea policy, the North Korea nuclear issue worsened.

While the militaries of both countries confront each other at the truce line, the two former administrations closed their eyes to national security issues.

The North’s nuclear programs haven’t been fully abolished, but for the first time the country is disabling its nuclear facility and is about to give a declaration of its nuclear activities.

We hope the 18th National Assembly will have a strong sense of duty for history and examine our suggestion sincerely.
