The Defense Ministry released the remarks of minister Han: “I am pleased to end the last day of the year with the opening of a direct telephone line as we celebrate the 23rd anniversary of Korea-China relations.”
Chinese Minister Chang said that the opening of the hotline was a “landmark event.”
Han called it “a meaningful accomplishment based on mutual trust and cooperation between the defense authorities of the two countries.”
However, what Chang called “landmark” stopped working on Monday.
It has not been cut off, but when Seoul calls, Beijing simply does not answer.
Seven days after Pyongyang announced the hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6, the hotline is still not working.

While the hotline was expected to contribute to the peace in Northeast Asia and safety of the Korean Peninsula, it is cooling down due to China’s rejection.
China is not an ally, but the Park Geun-hye administration has put special care on diplomacy with China, classifying it as a friendly nation.
 But the special care seems to have no effect when Pyongyang conducted the fourth nuclear test.
More pathetic is the excuse that high-level defense ministry officials made.


Seven days after Pyongyang announced the hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6, the hotline is still not working.

The origin of hotline was the direct communication system between Washington and Moscow set up in August 1963 to prevent unintentional war due to misunderstanding or accident.
