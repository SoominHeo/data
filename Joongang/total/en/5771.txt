Thus, it is very important what direction the UDP, the party with 81 seats, takes.
Keeping the ruling party in check and serving as an alternative are principle tasks for the opposition party in party politics.
 The questions are what is the partyâ€™s true identity and what is the party working for in reality.
Does the opposition party try to keep the ruling party and the government in check and act as a true alternative for  working-class and middle-class people?
As the government supplemented the negotiations over importing U.S. beef, the right thing to do would be to help import American beef for cheaper prices so that working-class and middle-class people can consume meat more easily.
But the UDP applied for provisional disposition to ban U.S. beef imports and is even preparing to file a lawsuit to discuss the unconstitutionality of beef imports.
Some UDP members suggest that they should protest U.S. beef imports outside the National Assembly and that negotiations over U.S. beef imports should be linked with negotiations over opening the 18th National Assembly.

One wonders what the UDP means when it says it works for working-class and middle-class people.
