Humans have begun to intervene in the natural exchange between species since 1984.
Their first creature was a sheep-goat chimera, produced by combining the embryos of a goat and a sheep.
With a mix of shaggy and curly hair, it was not good looking, and did not gain enough public attention.
A chimera mouse was created in 1988.
