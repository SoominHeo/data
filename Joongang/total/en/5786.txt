According to several surveys, 80 percent of people in Korea oppose the cross-country canal.
At this time, restoration and preservation are more important than new development.
The administration should no longer spend time arguing and persuading.
It is wasteful.
After observing what the majority wants, the administration has to formulate a new plan to improve the areas of the four rivers.


The Korean government finally took a proper step when President Lee Myung-bakâ€™s administration decided to turn its focus on  improvement of the four river areas: the Han River, Yeongsan River, Nakdong River and the Geum River, instead of the cross-country canal plan.

No one will oppose the government when it promises to improve the quality of water in the rivers as well as restore the regions near the four rivers.

The president has to officially give up his plan and he should announce the new plan, leading to improvement of the four rivers areas.
