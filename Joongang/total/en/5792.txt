What does the opening of the 18th Assembly have to do with U.S. beef imports?
Is the United Democratic Party intent on creating confusion by taking advantage of the declining support for the ruling party?
Powerful candidates of the United Democratic Party are competing to make proclamations about beef imports in view of the upcoming party’s national convention.
It is worrisome that the 18th Assembly’s opening, public welfare legislation and the FTA ratification will again be adrift in the midst of such politicking and emotion.


It basically means that five days are left for the United Democratic Party to enjoy having the greatest number of seats.

Thus, it is responsible politics for them to take care of the agreement’s ratification before the 17th Assembly ends.

The party has revealed a strategy to link the beef import problem with the opening of the 18th Assembly.
