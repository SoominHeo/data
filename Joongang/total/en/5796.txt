The Bible is one example: And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Here, in the original Aramaic, the word gamta, meaning rope, was wrongly translated as gamla, a camel.
But instead of destroying the original meaning, the translation was evaluated as having expressed it better.
Misinterpretation can happen in translation from one language to another.
A prime example is a July 1945 press conference held by Japanese Premier Kantaro Suzuki, when Japan was ready to surrender to Allied forces.
