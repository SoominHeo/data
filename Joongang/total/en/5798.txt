Japan finally unbolted the gate for cows under 20 months old in 2006.
We should take a close look at how the Japanese government responded.
Until Japan decided to start importing beef again, experts held thorough discussions and the government respected the discussions.
The Trust and Food Safety Commission organized a special investigative committee with 12 veterinarians and doctors and concluded after serious consideration that “the danger is very low for cows under 20 months old even without forehead testing.”
It also assured the nation with data: “3.5 million cows had forehead testing but there was no infection in under-20-month-old cows.”
This was eight months before resuming imports.
