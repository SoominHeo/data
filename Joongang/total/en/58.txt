Since 2010, Cirque du Soleil is struggling.
The resident performances in Tokyo and Macao have ended, and last yearâ€™s Seoul tour of Quidam was a failure.
Critics say circus performances are limited due to lack of narrative.
Countless circus productions followed, but none were successful.
It is a vain dream to hope for enormous added value by moving into the circus market, which has already become a red ocean.
In fact, the Park Geun-hye government is second to none when it comes to taking credit for cultural projects.
It has set cultural prosperity as a basis of state administration and committees have been created for cultural belts and complexes.
But the only work that President Park has done seems to be visiting a movie theater on Culture Day.
One of the rare successful cases of cultural initiative may be France in the 1980s.
The Mitterrand government could leave notable accomplishments in arts and culture because President Mitterrand was culturally refined and was in power for over ten years.
It takes time for culture to mature.
By nature, it cannot go along well with politics, where immediate outcomes win votes.
Perhaps Mayor Park will have to change direction or instead give up his presidential ambition and serve the third term as mayor to establish a circus in Seoul.
