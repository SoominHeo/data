The Onjeong People’s Hospital in Onjeong-ri, near Mount Kumgang, North Korea, was once considered insignificant, but it emerged as one of the North’s best hospitals recently.

It was mainly due to five South Korean doctors, who began to volunteer in the North once every two weeks since January last year.

They helped 40  patients suffering from cataracts emerge from the dark and recover sight.

The number of the hospital’s high-ranking patients exceeded more than 50 as of the end of last year.

Their medical treatment has been stopped since mid-April.
