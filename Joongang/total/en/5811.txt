In June of that year, more than 8 million were brought down by influenza in Spain.
It was referred to as “Spanish flu” by the French, while the Spanish called it the “French flu.”
Influenza was far more dreaded than the shells the French army rained down upon the German enemy.
By the time that summer came to a close, influenza had overtaken the German barracks; at least 400,000 German civilians lost their lives.
