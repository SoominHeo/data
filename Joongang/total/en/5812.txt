In the limelight these days in the world of comedy is the KBS-2 TV show “Dalin,” meaning expert in Korean.

He is also introduced as a master at keeping his eyes open, who has never blinked for 16 years.

It means someone who has made a lot of effort in one area and gains the highest level of expertise.

The word dalin appears for the first time in the book “Zho Zhuan.”

“Tong,” which means that something connects, and “dal,” which means that one reaches a point, mean the same thing in the end.
