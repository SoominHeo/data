In 2002, the Chinese government completed reconstruction of the ancient tower where it stood for millennia until it disappeared.

Only the name survived and it had seemed impossible to build another tower just like the old one.

Trying to see for a thousand miles I climb one more story.

As the eyes move from the vista afar to the scenery close by, one feels the vastness of the land.
