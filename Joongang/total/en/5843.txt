In 1829 in particular, the seventh U.S. president, Andrew Jackson, called it democracy in action and used the system as the basic principle of his appointments.
It was an attempt by Jackson, the son of a Western settler, to give ordinary people access to federal government posts ― then monopolized by the Northeastern upper class.
Nevertheless, Jackson only reshuffled 10 percent of government posts.

He is considered the president who applied the spoils system most efficiently and commendably.
He must have had a good eye for detecting unqualified people.
After having turned down one candidate, Lincoln apparently said to his assistant, “I don’t like his face.”
When the assistant said, “But he can’t be responsible for his face,” Lincoln replied, “A man over 40 is responsible for his face.”


Nevertheless, Jackson only reshuffled 10 percent of government posts.

Of the government posts a president can appoint, he replaced 85 percent.
