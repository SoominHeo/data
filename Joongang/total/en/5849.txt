It has been widely believed that golf originated sometime during the 14th and 15th centuries in Scotland.

According to the book, all holes are 3-par and players are not allowed to touch the ball except when placing it on the tee and retrieving the ball from the hole.

So the king banned all people between 12 and 50 years old from playing.
