The percentage of coal in world energy consumption has decreased to 24 percent in 2000 from 62 percent in 1950.
It seems that King Coal met its end in the late 20th century.
However a peculiar thing is happening.
Large mining companies like BHP Billiton and Anglo-American have started to look for new mines.
A recent focus of interest is the Tabantongoi mine in Mongolia, which was left undeveloped due to insufficient infrastructure.
The news is that China, Japan, the United States and Russia are all now locked in a contest to win development rights for this mine.
Coal, whose price rose over 75 percent in just a year, has now become a precious commodity, quite a turnaround from what was recently cheap and easy to find.
The largest reason is China, which has become a black hole absorbing all the resources it can from around the world.
Although China has sent a rocketship into space and is developing high-speed railways, it still relies on coal for 70 percent of its energy.
