Since a phenol accident 17 years ago, the government installed automatic water quality monitors at 17 sites designed to prevent pollution early on.
These machines, which automatically monitor and display water pollution levels on a 24-hour basis, cost $527,000 a set.
But they were pretty useless in preventing the recent accident.
Only one machine can monitor phenol pollution and it only works when the pollution level is extremely high.
