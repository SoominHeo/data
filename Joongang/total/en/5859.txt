The debate on the safety of GMOs was re-ignited by the recent announcement of upcoming import of about 50,000 tons of GMO corn starting in May.
It is rather dire for us to still be debating whether GMOs are harmful or not.
Our grain self-sufficiency stalls at 24.8 percent and only 0.8 percent of corn is domestically produced.
If we import regular grain and not GMOs, then the cost is high.
The global price of ordinary corn is $100 more expensive per ton than GMO corn.
