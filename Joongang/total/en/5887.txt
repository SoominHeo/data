Ten days later the king asked Gi-sung if the cocks were ready.
The easy-going fellow only gave a sullen answer.
He said the cocks were far from being ready, because they were so arrogant that they believed too much in their power.
Time after time, the king sought answers from the cockfighting expert, only to receive similar retorts.
Gi-sung would say “the cocks picked fights with other roosters,” or “the cocks wanted to fight too much and stared at competitors too fiercely.”
The king could not understand that, but to his credit, he bore with it patiently.
One day, Gi-sung finally declared the cocks were ready.


One day, Gi-sung finally declared the cocks were ready.

The people whose hearts have turned wooden like a wooden rooster are smitten with one thought.
