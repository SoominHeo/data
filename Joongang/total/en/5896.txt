On Jan. 10, the CEO of Matsushita, Fumio Otsubo announced, “Celebrating the 90th anniversary of the company, we will change the company’s name from Matsushita to Panasonic and end the use of the National brand; all products will carry the Panasonic brand.”
That means global growth is more important than nostalgia or the founder’s name.
The reason Matsushita’s world market share is only about 50 percent, much lower than Sony (70 percent) or Samsung Electronics (80 percent) is mostly due to brand dispersion.
