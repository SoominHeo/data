Eleven-year-old Ye-rin (the name has been changed to protect her identity) had to escape on her own to break out of the nightmare.

When a case of child abuse is reported, the victim is provided with a single room and 24-hour care.

What moved them were two drawings by the girl, each about 2 centimeters big.

On Tuesday, she added two flowers on the chimney she had drawn instead of smoke.
