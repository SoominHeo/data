With the people enthusiastic about him, Hosokawa served just eight months as prime  minister.
When he became sixty in 1998, he retired from politics.
He built a small Buddhist temple in Yukawara, Kanagawa Prefecture and spent his time working in the field and reading at home.
His title is now “Potter Hosokawa.”
The pottery skill that he learned beginning in 1999 is now a source of pride.
The world of politics, where he served for 30 years, often asked him to return.


His grandfather from his mother’s side is Fumimaro Konoe, who was a Japanese prime minister three times.

Maybe this is why he gave up re-election  as the governor of Kumamoto after serving for eight years.
