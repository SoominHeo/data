Since then, eight people have occupied the post.
Among them, the person who impressed us the most was Yeon Hyung-muk, who held the job from 1988 to 1992.
The prime minister of North Korea faces tough and dangerous working conditions.
Kim Il Sung emphasized the significance of the post by insisting that the “prime minister is the general of the nation’s economy.”
 The prime minister, in turn, has often been made the scapegoat for the people’s discontent about the country’s struggling economy.
And to make a bad situation worse, the public economy always took a backseat to the military economy, which led to nuclear and missile development.
One after another, numerous ministers have stepped down in dishonor or suffered incurable illness.
After the dishonorable withdrawal of former Prime Minister Li Gun-mo (1986-1988), Li’s successor, Yeon Hyung-muk, was demoted  after four years to the post of candidate member for the Political Bureau Presidium, or secretary of Jagangdo Provincial Party.
In addition, Prime Minister Park Bong-ju was demoted last April to manager of a small-town company.


Many believe, however, that the prime minister may actually be about 20th in actual influence, as there are plenty of hidden power elites in the political and army circles.

The post of prime minister in North Korea was created after the introduction of the state president in 1972.
