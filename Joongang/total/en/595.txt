There have been rumors since 2010 that Kim aspires to be North Korea’s answer to Deng Xiaoping.
The country has drawn a frame around each of its leaders: Kim Il Sung is credited with founding the nation, Kim Jong-il was integral in boosting defense and Kim Jong-un has focused on the economy.
And Deng is a perfect role model.
Just like Deng, the young leader studied in Europe early on and likes to take risks.
While studying in France, Deng learned about global development trends and had a chance to observe the industrial development of a modern nation.
Kim did the same in Switzerland.
Just as Deng experimented with reform in China’s four special districts in the late 1970s, Kim has established five central special economic zones and 19 regional economic development districts since 2013.
