Between A and B, A will argue that two-thirds of the constituency favors him.
Between B and C, B will argue he has a better chance to win, as two-thirds support him.

Isnâ€™t this a paradox of a democratic election?
The 1987 election in Korea was a good example of this paradox.
The three candidates, namely Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Tae-woo, competed with more or less similar support rates.

Democrat Al Gore received more popular votes but fewer electoral votes, so Republican George W. Bush won the election.
Even though more people favored Gore, he lost the election because of the mechanics of the electoral system.


Between B and C, B will argue he has a better chance to win, as two-thirds support him.

Likewise, between C and A, C will insist two-thirds prefers him over A.

All three candidates will run for election, and the competition will be so fierce that only a few votes will separate the winner from the losers.

The 1987 election in Korea was a good example of this paradox.

The candidate that more than 60 percent of voters did not want was elected president.
