Korea ranks 13th in economic power and eighth or ninth in military power worldwide.
Yet our troop dispatches overseas had been only to a total of 1,800 soldiers in 13 countries.


Despite pressures from the outside, the dispatch of Korean troops to other countries occurred three times during the  Goryeo and Joseon eras, according to the book containing the pertinent historical records.

The Institute of Military History of the Ministry of Defense says the direct and indirect economic benefits of the war came to more than an estimated $5 billion.

It is about stationing the 650 non-combatant soldiers for one more year.
