In March, 2005, Goldman Sachs, the U.S. investment bank, released a shocking report roiling the international financial markets.

A rumor swirled in the market that the third oil crisis could arrive at any moment.

The world oil price increased threefold in two years and the world economy became sluggish again.

Now the worldâ€™s oil price has almost reached $100 per barrel, some are talking about a third oil crisis, as if the world economy would collapse if the oil price exceeds $100 per barrel.

The current increase in oil prices has a different pattern to the two previous oil crises.
