After a while, 800 horse- and oxcarts were mobilized to support Rheeâ€™s third run at the presidential office in front of the Blue House.
Adjacent streets were full of the smell of horse and ox manure.
Oxcarts carried voters until the 1970s, at least in rural areas.
When the transport system was not yet fully established, it would not have mattered what carried the voters, be it an ox-cart or a cultivator because in many cases, voters chose a particular candidate because they had been given a pair of rubber shoes and a bowl of thick rice liquor in return for their vote.
It was the 1987 presidential election when the mass mobilization reached its apogee.

Otherwise it does not make sense that less than 20 percent of those who allegedly volunteered for the electoral college of the primary came to vote and that a majority of votes went to particular candidates depending on their constituency.
If the party argues that political events have always been carried out on the basis of public mobilization, then they must be right.


It was the 1987 presidential election when the mass mobilization reached its apogee.

Nevertheless more voluntary participants appeared at the gatherings of the opposition party, in line with the still-alive passion of the June movement for democracy.
