Duke Xi of Qi had three sons, Zhu’er, Jiu and Xiaobai.
Guan Zhong taught Jiu and Bao Shuya taught Xiaobai.
When the eldest son, Zhu’er, ascended the throne and became the Duke Xiang, he became a cruel ruler who oppressed the people and abandoned his lordly duties.
His two brothers, Jiu and Xiaobai,  respectively fled to the state of Lu and the state of Cao, where each of their mothers’ families lived.
