A prime minister became very angry at the heroes because they did not bother to show him respect when he walked in front of them, even though the prime minister was second only to the king in rank.
With the king’s silent approval, the prime minister decided to get rid of the three men.
The king, as part of the prime minister’s plot, obtained the five best peaches in the garden for a feast for a state guest.

Then one of the others grabbed a peach, mentioning his excellence in fighting off the giant snake.
“What about my peach?” asked the third man, who didn’t get a peach.

In their craving for the two peaches -- presidential power and recovering their status as a ruling party -- they have just indulged in infighting.
Their foolishness at being unable to read the bigger picture is just like the warrior who only knows how to use his sword.
The GNP must have been blinded by their “achievements,” believing they have done a great deal for this country.


One man killed a tiger, which had attacked a king who was hunting,  with his bare hands.

The third man saved the king under siege by using just an iron mace.

The king, as part of the prime minister’s plot, obtained the five best peaches in the garden for a feast for a state guest.

The three heroes wanted them.

Then one of the others grabbed a peach, mentioning his excellence in fighting off the giant snake.

The other two men also committed suicide, bemoaning the fact that they were blinded by peaches.

In their craving for the two peaches -- presidential power and recovering their status as a ruling party -- they have just indulged in infighting.

The people’s minds are already leaving the GNP, just like the prime minister who handed over the two peaches.
