While covering the changes of China in the past four years, I may have missed the things that remain unchanged internally.

China emerged as the second-largest economy in the world and was competing for global hegemony with the United States.

Korean and Japanese diplomats say their Chinese counterparts would call them at 2 a.m. with urgent businesses, but when the Korean and Japanese officials need to speak with them, they would not answer or call back.

China produces 38 billion pens a year, occupying 80 percent of the global market, but 90 percent of the ink is imported from Japan and other countries.

Especially toward the Korean Peninsula, Beijing adheres to the three principles of peace, denuclearization and resolution through talks.
