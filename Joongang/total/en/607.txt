I visited the museum in September and saw a sign that read, “Do not forget national humiliation.”
The Chinese take pride as the origin of East Asian civilization and have a victim mentality for having been surpassed and invaded by Japan twice in modern times.
So you will often meet Chinese people who openly denounce Japan and the Japanese.
But nowadays, scholars of international law say the Japanese people also speak ill of China.
Japanese naval experts argue that the Japanese militarists had challenged U.S. naval hegemony through the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the Pacific War in 1941 - which resulted in catastrophes - and China is repeating Japan’s past faults by prioritizing exclusive core interests and advocating an increase in naval power.
