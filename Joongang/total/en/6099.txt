Yet nothing could divert the king from the conclusion that he would gain 17 castles.
The king of Cho finally accepted Han’s proposal, and received the 17 castles in the region by dispatching his troops.
But that just stirred up the furor of Qin, a strong power of the Warring States Period.
Qin crushed Cho in the following battle, in which 400,000 of Cho’s soldiers were massacred.


It suggested handing 17 castles of its province over to Cho rather than losing them to Qin, on the condition that Cho help Han.

The king of Cho was extremely excited by the idea he would reap 17 castles like being handed a slice of cake.

On that day, however, the king dreamt that he rose to the heavens on a dragon, wearing a cloth tied to one shoulder that suddenly fell down to Earth.

Yet nothing could divert the king from the conclusion that he would gain 17 castles.
