In game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma is a situation in which the police arrest and interrogate two accomplices who have committed a crime; both prisoners beat the rap if they adamantly deny any wrongdoing.

However, if one prisoner confesses to the crime, he or she is released, while the other is punished.
