The rate is usually below 1 because the comparison quantity is rarely higher than the standard quantity.
In particular, composite rates are always below 1.

The magnification ratio is the relationship between the size of an object seen through telescopes and microscopes and its actual size; therefore, the ratio is usually greater than 1, and the term “times” is usually used.
As is the case with reduction ratios on copy machines, some rare instances exist when the ratio is below 1, but in most instances, ratio is used when the comparison quantity is much higher than the quantity to which it is being compared.


Both measurements reveal the degree of difference between two comparative quantities.

The rate is usually below 1 because the comparison quantity is rarely higher than the standard quantity.

In particular, composite rates are always below 1.

Ratio does not have a standard quantity but examines how many times greater one quantity is over another.
