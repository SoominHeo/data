The method’s proponents contend the paradox incurred through simple majority elections can be avoided 1,000-fold when using the Borda count method.
Ireland’s electoral system is based on proportional representation.
On polling day, voters indicate their first and second choices, and if the first-choice candidate does not receive at least half of the total votes, their votes are transferred to the second-choice candidate.


The results of the first round of voting are not a clear barometer of who will win.

The election could have been won if the votes had been consolidated into one candidate (Kim Young-sam or Kim Dae-jung).

In the Borda count election method, voters rank the candidates, and each ranking is given a value and tallied; for example, three points for first place, two points for second, and one point for third.

On polling day, voters indicate their first and second choices, and if the first-choice candidate does not receive at least half of the total votes, their votes are transferred to the second-choice candidate.

Votes for the candidate eliminated in the first round are calculated along with the second-choice candidate.
