When heading for the negotiating table, parties aim at conducting a win-win strategy, but once actual negotiations commence, it is natural for each party to jockey for the upper hand.

The former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, nicknamed the “Iron Lady,” who was very influential during the 1980s, was a master of this kind of negotiation.

Whenever entering important negotiations, she would also push negotiations beyond the allotted time; in highly intensive negotiations, most people can maintain focus for three hours.
