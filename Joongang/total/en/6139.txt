For the last 60 years, the people of Okinawa have consistently stated in their testimonies and research findings that in certain places, the suicides were commanded directly by military officers.
And yet, starting next year, any mention of the Imperial military’s enforcement of mass suicides will have disappeared from the history books.
The Japanese government on Friday ordered changes to seven history textbooks describing how the army forced civilians to commit mass suicide.
“There are testimonies [claiming military enforcement] but there are also divergent views of whether or not the suicides were ordered by the army, and no proof to say the army was responsible,” said an Education Ministry official.
This is an answer we’ve heard many times before.
It is, in fact, very similar to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s denial of the military’s role in mobilizing wartime sex slaves, saying that there were “testimonies but no official proof.”
 It is hardly a coincidence that these changes were ordered after several rightist figures started targeting the issue of “mass suicide” in 2005.


Some 12,000 U.S. soldiers and 65,000 Japanese soldiers were killed in a battle that also took the lives of at least 94,000 civilians.
