The 24 solar terms indicate the changes of seasons based on the revolution of the Sun.

Korean ancestors adopted the 24 solar terms to accommodate the seasons of the Korean Peninsula and referred to it as an agricultural guideline.

By the time the “Clear and Bright” comes on April 5, I hope the weather chart of the Korean Peninsula will be clear and bright.
