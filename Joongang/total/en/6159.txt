In a documentary film by Disney called “White Wilderness,” released in 1958, there is a scene in which a group of lemmings fell into the Arctic Ocean.
This scene created the myth about lemmings’ suicides.
But they don’t commit suicide.
They simply walk ahead because they have poor eyesight.
Even when a river or a hill lies ahead, they cannot stop walking because others push them from behind.
That’s why it is dangerous for lemmings to stay together on their own.
They need a guide.
During the spring of 1980 in Seoul, John Wickham, the former commander of the USFK, likened Koreans to lemmings because he said Koreans followed the new military regime.


Lemmings came from one corner of the screen and marched ahead.
