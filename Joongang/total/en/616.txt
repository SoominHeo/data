For 17 years since leaving office, Kim had been an unpopular former president, but so many people feel his absence.
I think he really worked to win the hearts of the people.
Whenever reporters and politicians talk about Kim, they never fail to mention how warmly he treated them.
A senior reporter who frequented Kim’s house recalled that whenever major party appointments were needed, Kim would lower his voice and ask, “Whom should I appoint?” Kim would not necessarily go with his recommendation, but he felt grateful to be asked his opinion.
Other politicians said that when they dined together, Kim would often offer them what he liked the most.
These trivial yet heartwarming memories have brought people together.
I would like to suggest that politicians and leaders try these two things - asking opinions and offering food - before they pass away.
