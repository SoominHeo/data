Lu was purged from office in 1166, when he was 42 years old, because he supported a fierce war against intruders.
A war hawk, Lu was hunted down by doves who wanted compromise.
Lu You could not hide the pain of expulsion and consoled himself by writing poems and travelling around his homeland.
In one of the long journeys he made in April of the following year, he climbed a mountain with only a stick and wearing light clothing.
Lu did not hesitate from scaling steep rocks at a time when hiking was already a hugely popular form of recreation.
Finally, he reached a dead end on his climb where the path disappeared.
At this very place, where he could hardly move, Lu You wrote one of his best poems.


At this very place, where he could hardly move, Lu You wrote one of his best poems.

This poem is a superb demonstration of the feelings of loss one faces when mountain trails end, and the water is  gone.
