Cable TV broadcasts at least 30 American dramas.

According to Time Magazine, the production cost of some series has increased 50 to 70 percent during the past three years.

It is interesting to look at the relationship between American film and TV dramas; after the golden age of classical movies, Hollywood lost many viewers to television and fought back with grand spectacle movies like “Ben-Hur” (1959).
