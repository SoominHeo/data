The same is true for the series of organized gangster movies like “The General’s Son” (1990) or “Friends” (2001).
Instead of being critical of society and reflecting the nature of violence, these movies focused on “macho fantasy.”
 The trademark of these movies was a reproduction of the “boss culture,” nostalgia for paternal power and the idolization of strength.
They made gangster movies for men.
A new subgenre of movies, gangster comedy, made its debut in the 2000s.
