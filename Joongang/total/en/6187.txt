Putting aside the regrets of the past year, people count down the last 10 seconds of the year in unison to welcome the new year.
Counting down the new year, which is an artificially created segment of time, has become an international ritual that inspires people and gives them a sense of identity.
In the United States, the “Bush Countdown Clock,” which counts the number of days left in the Bush presidency, is selling very well.
Of course, the clock is popular among figures in the Democratic Party who despise President Bush.
A picture of George Bush and the words “Our national nightmare will soon be over” are printed on the face of the clock.
It is clear his opponents must be very dissatisfied with George Bush if they want to count down the final days of his presidency, but it remains to be seen if looking at a clock for the last two years of George Bush’s presidency will be a joyous or agonizing act.
