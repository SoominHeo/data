The principle of aerial battles, “first look, first shot, first kill,” is much easier to accomplish with a stealth fighter.

Of all the fighter jets that have been developed in our history, the U.S.-built F-22s, deployed in December 2005, are equipped with the most complete stealth function.

From its material, design and exterior coating, the F-22 is the essence of Lockheed Martin’s best technologies.

Twelve F-22s, which have never previously left U.S. territory, will be deployed to Okinawa, Japan for three months starting this week.
