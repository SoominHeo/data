Among 21,000 Japanese troops, 20,000 died in battle.
The photo from Iwo Jima is still considered the symbol of courage and unity in the U.S. Marine Corp.  Three of the soldiers in the photo survived the battle and were praised as national heroes.
However, it turned out that the moment had been staged.
Those pictured were not the heroes who broke through the front amid flying bullets.
The Stars and Stripes that had been originally hoisted was stolen, so these soldiers were told to raise it again in front of a war correspondent.
The truth was revealed 55 years later.
