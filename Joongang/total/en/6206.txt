A discovery that greatly excited Japanese archaeologists took place in 1998 at the Kitora tomb in Asukamura, Nara Prefecture.
The archeologists discovered an astronomical chart no one expected to find there.
The estimated date of the chart is around A.D. 700, making it the oldest astronomical chart in the world.

It was a full-fledged astronomical chart that includes the Great Bear, Altair and Vega, the Scorpion and Orion as well as the exact equator and ecliptic.
What also surprised academia was that the night sky depicted in the astronomical chart in the Kitora tomb was that of Goguryeo.
The Japanese astronomers revealed that the location of the observation was near latitude 38 degrees north.
Taking the margin of error into account, some presumed that it must be the night sky observed from Pyongyang, the capital of Goguryeo, which boasted advanced astronomy at the time.

However, its origin goes back to the Goguryeo period.
There is a record that it was a revised reproduction of the “Stone-Carved Astronomical Chart” of Goguryeo.


The estimated date of the chart is around A.D. 700, making it the oldest astronomical chart in the world.

The painter of the Kitora tomb expressed the twinkling of the stars by putting gold foil on each of 350 stars.

The Japanese astronomers revealed that the location of the observation was near latitude 38 degrees north.

The link connecting the two charts is national treasure number 228, “The Chart of the Constellations and the Regions They Govern,” created during the reign of King Taejo of Joseon.
