Mid-term elections held between the first and last year serve as mere middle tests.
President Roh Moo-hyun’s proposal for a constitutional amendment is a push to hold honeymoon elections.
He contends that a president can work effectively when a unified government is in place -- the political party backing the president maintains a majority in the National Assembly.
President Roh has grumbled on numerous occasions, pointing the finger for his administration’s failure at a divided government with an opposition-dominated parliament.
It is very difficult to accept the logic that the political party supporting the president must control the National Assembly.
The ruling party does not always benefit from honeymoon elections.
President Roh’s political party suffered a crushing defeat in the April 2003 by-elections two months after he was elected president.
Despite this fact, he enforced the appointment of Ko Young-koo as director of the National Intelligence Service, although the ruling and opposition parties both opposed him.
For healthy couples, it matters to whom one is married, not when one is married.


A newly elected president enjoys a honeymoon atmosphere for the first several months in office.

Mid-term elections held between the first and last year serve as mere middle tests.
