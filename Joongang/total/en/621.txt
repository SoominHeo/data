Landmarks and monuments around the world were lit blue, white and red on Nov. 14 in tribute to the Paris victims.

More than 400,000 Koreans visited France this year.

But all were not shown at once, which would have actually represented the French flag.

Seoul is a city with a population of 10 million and claims to be the new mecca of the IT industry.

So I could not believe that the city not only failed to sense the worldwide sentiment but also could not manage to project three colors on a tower that sometimes offers a 3-D light show.
