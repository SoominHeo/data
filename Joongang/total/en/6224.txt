However, the virtue of the movie is that it transcends attacks on 80s values and the 386 generation that is now in power.
This movie urges reconciliation between eras.
The main character, Yoon-hee, does not regard herself as a scapegoat.
She lives as a single mother and accepts her situation for what it is.
In this manner, “The Old Garden” introduces a new form of 80s archetype ― a human being that chooses tolerance over conflict, who is not tied to a fixed period of time.


 Mr. Liom, who is a member of the 386 generation himself, displays his cynicism in this film.

The movie shows the violence of the 80s through the eyes of Yoon-hee, and she values love more than politics.

In this manner, “The Old Garden” introduces a new form of 80s archetype ― a human being that chooses tolerance over conflict, who is not tied to a fixed period of time.

Hence, the movie is a discovery of a hidden legacy from the 80s.
