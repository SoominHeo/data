Much later, in 1991, old scrolls were found in the Tottori area.
They contained a drawing of the incident, thank-you letters from the sailors and a list of the castaways.
Tottori Prefecture authorities traced the descendants of the people on the list and held an event to commemorate the incident.
This  incident has since been widely used as a symbol of friendship between Korea and Japan.
But Tottoriâ€™s history is not all pretty.
Take Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japanese.
Old Japanese records state that in 1618, the Otani and Murakawa families of Tottori received government permits to cross the sea border, and they fished near the islets on the way to and from Ulleung Island.
