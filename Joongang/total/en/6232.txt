Only 100 years ago, in downtown Beijing, there were many young people who frequented opium stores.
They were the offspring of aristocrats of the Qing dynasty.
These young people had a variety of hobbies, including growing birds such as pigeons or hawks, gambling on cricket fights and womanizing.
They were good-for-nothing in the truest sense.
They did horrible things to people, too.
In the early part of the Qing dynasty, a grandson of a high government official beat one of his slaves to death, cut off his limbs and burned the body, infuriating the emperor.
In the reign of an earlier emperor, a son of a government official beat 30 slaves to death.


In the reign of an earlier emperor, a son of a government official beat 30 slaves to death.

The expression was used during the Sung Dynasty for the first time and has been used ever since when referring to offspring from rich and powerful families.
