The success of “The Blair Witch Project,” an independent film that turned the cyberspace world upside down in 1999, spread the fake documentary format and marketing tactic to general commercial films.
This “real” horror film about three student filmmakers searching for a mythical witch gone missing grossed over 400 times the production cost, bringing instant fame to the directors and producers.
