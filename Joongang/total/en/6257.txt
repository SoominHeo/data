You can get this t-shirt on one condition â€• buy a coffee package.

A package of 110 grams, or 0.25 pound, costs $75.

This designer coffee was imported to Korea and sold in one department store.

Most buyers are housewives in their 30s or 40s, which stirred a debate on the Internet as to whether they were just acting pretentious or not.
