Just when you see that one of the girls, or boys, is less than attractive, you have an ill omen that you might be paired with the least charming one.

The second before the partners are announced, you think, “Oh, daeryak nangpae.”

The expression, “nangpae” first appeared in “Antholo-gy” compiled by Prince Somyeong.
