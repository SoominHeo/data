Mr. Inoki was caught by Mr. Kim’s arm bar technique and defeated after seven minutes and six seconds.

According to an official Japanese record, there were 38 matches between Mr. Kim and Mr. Inoki.

When Mr. Kim first met Mr. Inoki, whose family had emigrated to Brazil, he said, “I am from Korea, and you are from Brazil.

Once again, I pray for the repose of Mr. Kim’s spirit.
