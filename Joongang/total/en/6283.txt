Three months later, a special envoy visiting Seoul in September brought 300 boxes of songi mushrooms picked from Mt.
Chilbo.
The unexpected gift was distributed among influential Koreans, who sampled the taste of a “symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.”
A summit meeting between Japan and North Korea was held in September 2002, and when then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was returning to Tokyo, Chairman Kim presented 300 boxes of songi mushrooms.


The 1,200-year-old poetry collection “Manyoshu,” or “Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves,” contains a poem praising the aroma of matsutake.

Chairman Kim Jong-il promised former President Kim Dae-jung that he would send songi mushrooms in the fall at the summit meeting in June 2000.
