Although “Tazza” is a well-made film which deserves such popularity, people are interested in when the movie will attract 5 million viewers, and whether it will break the 10-million mark.
Of course, 10 million is a great number.


For example, “Tazza,” the box office winner in the Chuseok holiday season, attracted 4 million viewers in 13 days.

In 1895, the American monthly book review “The Bookman” created a section dedicated to book sales for the month.
