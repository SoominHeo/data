In 2000, the Obuchi government included the reinforcement of word politics in a report entitled “Japan’s Vision in the 21st Century.”
The power of words is an extension of  soft power advocated by Joseph Nye, the dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.
The key is the power of persuasion ― to bring others to your side not with carrots and sticks but with ideas and charm.
Mr. Nye claimed in an article contributed to Foreign Affairs in 2004 that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld does not even understand the term soft power.
