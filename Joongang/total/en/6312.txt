The blockbuster is expected to gross 6 billion yen in Japan alone.
Ironically, the “anti-Japanese” marketing campaign promoted by the Korean distributor has contributed to its box office success.
Of course, “Japan Sinks” is hardly an “anti-Japanese” movie.
In the shell of a Hollywood-style disaster flick, it contains the elevated political tension in Asia and portrays a Japan increasingly positioning itself  formilitary power.
The movie is based on a novel written by Sakyo Komatsu in 1973 at a time of  oil shortage.
