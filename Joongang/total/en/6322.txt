This method grades pleasure and pain in four categories: intensity, duration, certainty and remoteness.
By adding up  the score you can calculate a degree of happiness.
However, it does not seem that Bentham was able to define the greatest happiness for the greatest number by this method of calculation.
Soon after that, the economists tried to  define happiness.
Paul Anthony Samuelson, who wrote “Economics: An Introductory Analysis,”  suggested the equation that happiness equals consumption divided by desire.
In this formula, if one wants to increase happiness with human desire as a premise, then one must increase consumption.
For this reason, Samuelson’s equation was criticized for stressing materialism and the excesses of capitalism.
But this equation reflects Eudemonism more than people think.
Reduced to the common denominator of the fraction, we are happier with restricted resources.
It is the same sense whereby monks are able to reach happiness by reducing their desires until the very end of life.
After Samuelson proposed his equation for calculating happiness, many other economists presented even more complicated ways to configure happiness, but not many agreed with their proposals.
All of a sudden, it seems that people have become more interested in happiness than ever before.
Over 26 books related to happiness have been published since June, so we can call it a time of happiness fever.
