In the 1930s, the residents of Chaozhou in the Guangdong Province in China worshiped Confucius, and the local children attended a Confucian initiation ceremony when they entered school.
They would offer a transparent candy, a symbol of a fish eye, to the tablet of Confucius and bow, praying to the great philosopher to take them as disciples.
Fish were believed to have sharp eyes, and the children made a sincere wish for eyes that would better understand the world.
Li Ka Shing, who was born in 1928, was no exception when he turned five and was sent to school.

However, the world’s 10th-richest man is not a target of criticism.
His philosophy is to never do business that harms society, no matter how big the profit.
On Aug. 24, the honorable Li Ka Shing announced that he would donate one third of his wealth, about 6.3 billion dollars, to the Li Ka Shing Foundation.
Mr. Li lives by a teaching in the Analects: “Wealth and honor acquired by unrighteousness are floating clouds.”


Li Ka Shing, who was born in 1928, was no exception when he turned five and was sent to school.

Being the eldest son, Li Ka Shing made a pledge that he would take care of the family when he was only 14.

However, he never stopped reading and eventually he  realized the dream that his mother had put in the meal she prepared on his first day of school.
