Only the shell of Article 9 remains today.
We could even call it dead.
Some think the coexistence of Article 9 with the Self-Defense Forces is the cleverest political compromise in history, while others consider it an example of the art of ambiguity.


In 1948, the Japanese Ministry of Education published “Atarashii Kenpo no Hanashi,” or “Tales of the New Constitution,” a commentary on the constitution that was enacted the year before.

The book offers a noteworthy interpretation on Article 9.

However, the validity of the interpretation expired after only two years, when the Korean War broke out, completely changing the situation.

So the Japanese government began interpreting Article 9 more liberally.

Only the shell of Article 9 remains today.

Some think the coexistence of Article 9 with the Self-Defense Forces is the cleverest political compromise in history, while others consider it an example of the art of ambiguity.

If Japan shakes itself free from the restraint of Article 9, the consequences will be no trivial matter.
