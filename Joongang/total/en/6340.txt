French fries ― nothing more than sliced and fried potatoes ― are one of the most important menu items in modern fast food restaurants.

In March 2003, the U.S. House of Representatives changed the name of French fries to “freedom fries” on the menu in the congressional cafeteria to show the congressmen’s anger at France for opposing the U.S. plan to invade Iraq.
