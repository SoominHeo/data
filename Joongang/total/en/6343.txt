The New York Times recently reported that over the last 150 years, peopleâ€™s bodies have radically changed.

Adult North Korean males, of the same ethnicity as South Koreans, are on average 158 centimeters tall, a full 15 centimeters shorter than their South Korean counterparts.

The average North Korean child is more than 20 centimeters shorter than the average South Korean child due to malnutrition.

Last year, the North received 1.08 million tons of food.
