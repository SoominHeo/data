One notable figure is Chou Shilliang, from the late Tang Dynasty.

Chou killed two emperors, 1,000 royal concubines and four ministers.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang was once considered a wise king, but when he fell for Yang Guifei, he neglected the empire and ruined it.

“He orders me to dance/My arms belong to me/but I am not the one controlling the movements/ I want to take a rest/ but he urges me to stand up and dance,” wrote poet Park Jeong-sun in the poem, “Marionette.”

Some also worry that the 386-generation codes might be taking this government by the scruff of the neck.
