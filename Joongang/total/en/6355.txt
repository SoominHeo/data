The six Vestal Virgins, who tended the sacred fire, were sanctified.

Even a condemned man being taken to the execution ground was pardoned if he was lucky enough to come across one of the Vestal Virgins on the way.

Only a few hours before leaving the office, former U.S. President Bill Clinton granted 141 pardons and 36 commutations, and his move started a discussion to revise the Constitution to prevent the abuse of the presidential pardon.

In 2004, the National Assembly revised the law on clemency to require the president to consult with the legislature in advance, but then acting president Goh Kun vetoed the change.
