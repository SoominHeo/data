Premier Zhou Enlai, who was also the foreign minister at the time, played a major role in advocating the Five Principles.

The Five Principles are always included in constitutional clauses, friendly treaties and major agreements involving China.

After the end of the Cold War, Beijing’s foreign policy followed a 16-[Chinese] letter strategy, to “calmly observe, respond with composure, hide brightness and nourish obscurity and never stand in the front.”

However, as Beijing began to focus more on “rising” than on doing so peacefully, the slogan disappeared from official statements two years ago.

 It is a Chinese version of the interference policy, and the six-party meeting is said to be a product of that policy.
