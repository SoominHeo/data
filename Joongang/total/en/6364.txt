The tribes were not an exception to the “Ratchet Effect,” an economics rule which says that it is hard to lower the consumption level once it has increased, even if earnings have decreased.
However, despite their earnest wish, no more supply boxes came to their islands.
They had made the error of what people who study logic call, “post hoc, ergo propter hoc.”
They had confused the simple sequential order of events.
In short, they thought a specific event was the cause of another event, just because it happened before the other event.
In late 1945, an Australian magazine called “Pacific Islands Monthly” named this custom of the Papua New Guinea tribes the “Cargo-Cult.”
