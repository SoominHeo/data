Ms. Jolie, who has long been participating in a campaign to help refugees, announced that she would donate one-third of her income to humanitarian groups.
Largely influenced by Ms. Jolie’s social awareness, the Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt was converted to activism as well.
The actor, who recently donated $4 million to African charities, made the “15 People Who Make America Great” list selected by Newsweek.
The money came from the sale to media outlets of the first photos of Shiloh Nouvel Jolie Pitt, the couple’s child born in April.
After the photos were published, the gray shirt the baby was wearing became wildly popular.
The $38 cotton shirt was sold out in stores all over the United States.
