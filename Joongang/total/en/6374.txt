The trust between the two representatives led to a successful summit meeting between the two countries.
On December 16, 2003, a Mr. X, representing the United States, arrived in London for a last-minute three-party negotiation meeting with Libya and Britain.
That was Senior Director for Proliferation Strategy Robert Joseph, now undersecretary of state.
His Libyan partner was Musa Kusa, who is rumored to have coordinated the 1998 bombing of the Pan Am flight from London to New York.
Neither Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld nor Secretary of State Colin Powell was informed of Mr. Josephâ€™s London meeting, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Three days later, Libya declared that it would give  up its weapons of mass destruction.
