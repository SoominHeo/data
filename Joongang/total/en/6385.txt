Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, was killed in a missile attack by an Israeli helicopter gunship as he was leaving a mosque in the Gaza Strip on March 22, 2004.

Terrorists who recklessly attack civilians in suicide bombings certainly present a huge problem, but Israel and the United States cannot avoid ethical criticism for firing missiles and dropping bombs on civilian quarters in order to target and kill one enemy leader without thinking about the lives of women and children.

Recently, six members of a Palestinian family were killed while at a beach picnic by shells presumed to have been fired by Israeli forces, although Israel denies that it was responsible for that incident.
