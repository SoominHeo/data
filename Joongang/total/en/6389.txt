The hare gave one end each of a rope made of arrowroot vines to the elephant and the hippopotamus and tricked them into thinking they would find treasure if they pulled the rope.
Without realizing that they were given the same rope, the elephant did its best to pull the rope from the woods and the hippopotamus did the same from the river.
After a while, the exhausted elephant got thirsty and went down to the river just as the hippopotamus got out of the water.
When they realized that they had been tricked, the hare was long gone.
In 1884, Gustav Nachtigal, a German consul in Tunis, visited a small fishing village in Togo.
