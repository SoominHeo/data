In 1789, the year the French Revolution began, taxes was imposed on windows and doors.
The tax were based on the width of the window.
Because heat in houses escapes through windows, only the rich could afford to heat their homes and still have wide windows.
When the tax was introduced, people began reducing the width of their windows, making them taller, and so French windows were born.
When developments in bacteriology led to a theory that narrow windows block natural light and could spread germs, the tax was abolished in 1926.

William III, Englandâ€™s Protestant king, needed a large fund to suppress the revolt of the Irish Catholics, so he created a window tax in 1696, based on the number of windows per house.

The standard price had been raised by 18.94 percent last year as well.
