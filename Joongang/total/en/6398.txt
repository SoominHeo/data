Mussolini used the term to mean that the world revolved around these three countries.
U.S. President George W. Bush said that the expression, “axis of evil,” was inspired by Mussolini’s axis and former President Reagan’s “evil empire,” namely the Soviet Union.
North Korea, Iran and Iraq were named as the central links in the proliferation of terrorism.
Since the “axis of evil” speech, various terms have been derived.
“Axis of good” is the highlight of the trend.
This year, three leftist Latin American leaders, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia, formed an alliance and advocated themselves as the axis of good.

Venezuela’s diplomatic delegation arrived in North Korea for a visit on Tuesday.
There is something peculiar about the visit.
Until the outcome is announced, let’s just call the two countries’ relationship the “axis of no neckties.”
 One thing common about the leaders of North Korea and Venezuela is their reluctance to wear suits.

This year, three leftist Latin American leaders, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia, formed an alliance and advocated themselves as the axis of good.

Morales said in April that Castro was his grandfather and Chavez his father, anointing himself as the son.

 It was a mockery of the two lame-duck leaders.
