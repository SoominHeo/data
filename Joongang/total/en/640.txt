Now, all Chinese people can have two children, which had only been allowed to families with special circumstances, such as ethnic minorities.
As the one-child policy was implemented for more than a generation, the population structure has become extremely distorted.


At the 1954 National Peopleâ€™s Congress, Peking University President Ma Yinchu warned that China would be faced with a crisis if it failed to control population growth.

It was hard to meet the food demand, so China introduced an extreme measure unprecedented in human history: the one-child policy.

Now, all Chinese people can have two children, which had only been allowed to families with special circumstances, such as ethnic minorities.

As the one-child policy was implemented for more than a generation, the population structure has become extremely distorted.

While the one-child era is gone now, the age of little emperors begins.
