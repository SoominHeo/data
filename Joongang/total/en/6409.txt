Before the worldwide release of the film on May 18, Christian and Catholic groups around the world sought to ban the screening.
While Korean Christians applied for a provisional injunction to ban parts of the film, the authorities rejected the request.
However, the controversy is only helping publicize the book and the film.
The locations, characters and artwork featured in the story, such as the Louvre Museum, Leonardo da Vinci, the Mona Lisa, are gaining even greater popularity.

Singaporean authorities have resolved the controversy from a different angle.
The film has been rated to be available for those over 16 years, since they are old enough to distinguish fact from fiction.
