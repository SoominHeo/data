Zenkichi Hanai was another Japanese person on Sorok Island.
He was granted religious freedom after coming in 1921 and looking after patients for eight years.
He refused a stone monument.
But the patients built one for him after he died.
During a period of eliminating the remains of the Japanese imperialism, the patients hid the monument underground and later placed it in its original spot.
Thus there is no racial discrimination on Sorok Island.
At times, patients were locked in a confinement room and given  vasectomies by force.
The fear of infection banned patients  from meeting their children.
The Hansen’s patients forcibly quarantined during Japanese imperial rule are having a hard time receiving compensation.
The Japanese government asks for evidence, but since most records disappeared after Japan lost the war, it is almost impossible.
Until now, only two have received compensation.

In 1942, a patient Lee Chun-sang killed the director and he was executed the next year.
