The Taiwanese presidential election is coming up in January, and the shift in power from the Kuomintang, which initiated reconciliation with China, to the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates Taiwan’s independence, is very likely.
A Taiwanese reporter with whom I became friends while working as a Hong Kong correspondent recently showed me his passport.
Among the young Taiwanese, it was a trend to put the label “The Republic of Taiwan” on the passport cover that says “The Republic of China.”
Many of them are Democratic Progressive Party supporters.

It conveyed the message that the friendship between the two countries is so solid that formality is not necessary.
