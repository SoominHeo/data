At 11 a.m. on weekdays, the changing ceremony of the British Household Cavalry takes place in front of Buckingham Palace.

Prince Harry, the second son of Prince Charles and the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, has joined the Blues and Royal Regiment under the Household Cavalry.

While British citizens seem pleased with the boldness of the 21-year-old prince, the royal family and the government are concerned about his safety.
