In 1931, a three-column report about an incident in Wanbaoshan, Manchuria was published in a Korean newspaper.
The story said that Korean farmers were beaten by  Chinese farmers due to a conflict about waterways.
Actually, it was the Korean farmers’ fault, as they were making waterways in the Chinese farmers’ field without permission.
However, the false report caused Chinese people living in Korea to be attacked, and 127  Chinese residents in Pyongyang and Incheon were killed.
