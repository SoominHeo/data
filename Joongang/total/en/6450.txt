Right after the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991, for example, U.S. President George Bush called  Soviet Union President Boris Yeltsin.

President Yeltsin promised to cooperate and the U.S. officials went into Russia the next year and exhumed 18 bodies.

The team was organized in 2003, combining the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory with 30 years of experience and a task force which has exhumed war dead for 10 years.

The Korean Army announced it will launch a national defense team to speed up exhuming the bodies of the soldiers who died during the Korean War next January.
