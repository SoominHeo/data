When I entered college 25 years ago, I was curious about Japan, so I immersed myself in Lee O-young’s “Smaller is Better.”

Until 10 years ago, it was widely accepted in Japan that the victims of the Nanking massacre numbered at least 200,000.

Now, Tokyo again wants to drastically reduce the number of casualties, to about 20,000 to 40,000 victims.
