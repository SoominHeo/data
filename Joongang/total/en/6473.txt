According to Internet media outlet e-Good News, Dr. Hwang’s online supporters at portal sites Daum and Naver total about 175,000.
“I Love Hwang Woo-suk,” “Society of the People Who Love Hwang Woo-suk,” and “Society of Egg Donors for Dr. Hwang Woo-suk’s Research” are a few of the groups.
There are also a great number of opponents of Dr. Hwang.
They are different from the supporters in that they cannot be found on the street.
Most of them operate in cyber- space.
Approximately 2,000 have joined groups such as “Hwang Woo-suk the Liar,” “Hwang Woo-suk the Trash” and “Anti-Hwang Woo-suk Cafe.”
