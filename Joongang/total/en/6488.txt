The Yomiuri Shimbun narrowly avoided such a fate ― on May 24, 1898 an editorial meant to say “Wise and Almighty Emperor of Russia,” but mistakenly wrote “Unwise and Incapable Emperor of Russia.”
The Yomiuri saved itself by immediately issuing an extra, becoming the first newspaper to issue a special edition to corrrect a typo.

The Yasukuni Shrine, which means “shrine for the security of the country,” performs a religious service for 2.5 million war dead, including Japanese class-A war criminals and the Korean and Taiwanese draftees the Japanese mobilized for war.
The shrine gathers the criminals and their victims at the same place and praises them as heroes.

This strategy has been a success, and today the Yomiuri Shimbun sells 14 million copies a day, the best selling newspaper in the world.
