The 68-year-old Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was returning home after an early morning religious service at a mosque nearby his house, disappeared without a trace with his wheelchair.
He was the spiritual leader who founded Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, a radical Islamic group.
He had proclaimed Jihad saying, “There should be God’s flag waving in every single part of Palestinian land.”
He meant that they should totally erase Israel from the map.
He did not hesitate to carry out suicide bomb attacks, using the brigades of Ezzedin al-Qassam, a military group.
Israel continuously went after Sheik Ahmed Yassin, once even sending F-16 fighters to kill the Islamic leader.
Israel’s hostility toward Yassin turned into fear in 1998.
That year, Yassin visited several neighboring Muslim countries for four months and was welcomed as a hero.
During his trip, Yassin was able to collect 300 million dollars.
Using the money, Hamas built schools and hospitals in Gaza City and the West Bank and received broad support from the poor living in Palestinian areas.
When Israel started targeting Hamas for its terrorist attacks, Yassin predicted two things.


Early morning on March 22, 2004.

The 68-year-old Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was returning home after an early morning religious service at a mosque nearby his house, disappeared without a trace with his wheelchair.

When Israel started targeting Hamas for its terrorist attacks, Yassin predicted two things.

And “By 2025, Israel will disappear from the Earth.”

Two years have not yet passed since Yassin’s predictions, but they are already half realized.

However unlike the Crusades, Saladin’s Jihad, the holy war, still continues even until today, after 900 years.
