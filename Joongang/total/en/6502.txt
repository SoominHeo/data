According to child psychologists, an average child develops an ability to categorize males and females at age 3.

Especially in the case of boys, there is a theory that they overcome the Oedipus complex, a concept advocated by Sigmund Freud about the unconscious sexual desire towards his mother and feeling jealous of his father, around age 6.
