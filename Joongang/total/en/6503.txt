The Portuguese forces hurriedly pulled out of East Timor, which had been under Portuguese rule for nearly 400 years.
While East Timor declared independence in November, 1975, it was occupied by Indonesia only two weeks later.
International analysts explain that the enormous amount of oil and natural gas discovered in the Timor Sea between East Timor and Australia was the cause of the invasion.
In 1978, Australia became the only country in the world to acknowledge Indonesiaâ€™s sovereignty over East Timor.
In return, in 1989, Indonesia shared the right to develop oil fields in the Timor Sea with Australia.
The intervention of the United Nations ended the iron rule of Indonesia in 1999 but, according to a report on human rights infringements that the East Timorese Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation submitted to the United Nations on January 20, more than 180,000 people were killed during the Indonesian occupation.
However, President Xanana Gusmao of East Timor forgave the assailants.
He said that the objective of the report was to reveal the truth, not to punish the wrongdoers.
He gave up revenge for the future of the nation.
Mr. Gusmao signed an agreement to develop the oil and natural gas in the Timor Sea with Australia in May, 2002, a month after his inauguration.
