When the copper coinage was first introduced in Sweden during the rule of Queen regnant Christina, who reigned from 1632 to 1654, a 10 taler coin weighed 19.75 kilograms.
The rich had to store money in the basement in order to prevent the house from collapsing.
The gold standard, which had been widely enforced before World War I, was based on the premise that the actual value of the metal used for a coin was the same as the nominal value of the money.
What bolstered the gold standard was the freedom to mint coins and to make bullion.
When the value of the gold in a gold coin fell below the face value of the coin, people with raw gold had the right to demand the central bank to make their gold into coins.
If the price of gold in a gold coin exceeded the face value of the coin, the holder of the coin had the right to melt the coin into an ingot.
That way, the value of gold coins and gold bullion could be kept in balance.
