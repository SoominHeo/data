In 1908, Wassily Kandinsky threw down his brush and went for a walk because his work was not turning out well.
When he returned to his workroom with a clear mind, a stunning drawing caught his eyes.
The shape was unclear but it was a water painting drawn with only pure colors.
When he pulled himself together, he realized it was his work turned sideways by mistake.
This was the beginning of abstract painting.
There is an age-old question whether humans have pheromones.
In 1995, Claus Wedekind of Bern University had women smell t-shirts soaked in menâ€™s sweat.
The result showed that women liked male scent genetically different from their own.
They did not like the smell of a father or a brother.
By this experiment, the existence of pheromones, useful for finding different genes in order to get genetically strong descendants, was confirmed.
The greatest works in the creative field, such as science and art, often start from an unexpected happening.
A simple mistake was the start of abstract painting and a sweat-soaked t-shirts proved the existence of pheromones.
The more a field requires creativeness, the more the discovery of a century could suffer from prejudice or cold treatment.
A long period of waiting is necessary before a thing is acknowledged firmly as a truth.
Christiaan Huygens of the Netherlands introduced wave theory in 1678.

Einstein spent hard times for three years after he published his theory of relativity.
Due to World War I, his thesis did not even make it to England.


Christiaan Huygens of the Netherlands introduced wave theory in 1678.

Huygens remained silent and it was more than a hundred years before Augustin Jean Fresnel of France proved that light does travel in waves.

Einstein spent hard times for three years after he published his theory of relativity.

Huygens waited 137 years in his grave.
