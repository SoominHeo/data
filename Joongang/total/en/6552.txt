The British science journal “Nature” and the American “Science” have led world science for the past 100 years.
Darwin’s theory of evolution and the DNA double helix discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick were introduced through “Nature.”
 Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen’s discovery of X-rays, Thomas Hunt Morgan’s research on drosophila genetic mutation and Einstein’s work on gravity were all published in “Science.”
 Among scientific journals, “Physical Review” in physics, “Cell” in biology and “JACS” in chemistry are the leading journals in each field.
However, none of these are a match for “Nature” or “Science” in either tradition or influence.
Both journals are well-acknowledged for their authority.
There is a saying that, “Once published in either journal, 10 years of research is guaranteed.”
 It is every scientist’s dream to have their thesis introduced on the cover page.
Their editors’ desks are the first places the latest research arrives.
To maintain their authority, an objective verification procedure is very strict.
However, it is impossible for anything to be perfect.
The discovery of the Piltown fossil in England in 1912 is known as a representative fraud case in the science field.
