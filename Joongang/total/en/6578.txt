The French Revolution, which took place from 1789 to 1794, not only overthrew the absolute monarchy in France but also had a tremendous influence on menswear.

As France went through the 1830 July Revolution and the 1848 February Revolution, the revolutionaries began to dress in pantaloons, the predecessor of suit trousers, and simple outerwear.

While the old uniform used mainly black and blue and had a dark, cool feel to it, the colors for the new one are light grey and ivory.
