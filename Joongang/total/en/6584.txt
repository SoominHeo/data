In April, 1949, Choi Dae-gyo, then head of the Seoul District Public Prosecutors Office, uncovered an alleged corruption charge against the minister of commerce and industry, Im Yeong-sin, who was a favorite of President Syngman Rhee.
When Ms. Im ran for by-election, she had allegedly embezzled government funds and collected donations from companies on the pretext of buying birthday presents for the president.
The prosecution naturally indicted Ms. Im.
However, President Rhee pressured the prosecution, through the justice minister, not to bring an indictment against Ms. Im.
The justice minister ordered that prosecutors get his pre-approval before prosecuting a minister.
Mr. Choi did not yield and insisted that whether to bring an indictment or not was a matter for the prosecutor, and that the minister could not intervene in a specific case.
The chief prosecutor summoned and personally questioned Ms. Im, and indicted her on bribery charges.
The case was recorded as the first incident of a prosecution official standing against a minister of justice for inappropriately exercising his command.
Controversy over the justice minister’s exercise of command re-emerged half a century later in July, 2002, during the Kim Dae-jung Administration.

The Blue House tried to have at least one of the two sons investigated without detention.

Minister Song was replaced at once.
