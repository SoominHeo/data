By observing this process, Andre Marie Ampere discussed the existence of fluoride in 1810, but he never succeeded in proving it existed.
Then even if one were able to separate fluoride from hydrogen it would immediately adhere to another substance, making it almost impossible to extract pure fluoride.
Until Henri Moissan was able to extract pure fluoride in 1886, numerous scientists died while attempting the process.

That was after Trendley Dean, the father of fluoride, discovered that residents who drank water with fluoride had fewer cavities than those who didn’t.
Since then, American citizens have been drinking tap water with fluoride, but whether it is safe is still a controversial issue.
