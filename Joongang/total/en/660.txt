“Why is such a mega sporting event being held in such a slow economy?” I thought as I traveled through Mungyeong Saejae mountain pass to report on the 2015 International Military Sports Council (CISM) World Games.
Held from Oct. 2 to 11, the World Games is a meaningful event for the 7,045 active-duty military personnel from 117 countries who participate.

The Pyeongchang Games, whose total budget is estimated to be 13 trillion won, should take a lesson from the wisdom and efficiency demonstrated in Mungyeong.

Held from Oct. 2 to 11, the World Games is a meaningful event for the 7,045 active-duty military personnel from 117 countries who participate.

But the CISM World Games learned from the failures of the Incheon Asian Games and F1: The total budget for the event is 165.3 billion won - 7.4 percent of the 2.2 trillion won for the Incheon Asian Games and 26 percent of the 619 billion won for the Gwangju Universiade.

It would have cost 80 billion won to build new apartments for visiting athletes, but the organization committee provided accommodations for 3.5 billion won.

The opening ceremony for the Military World Games cost 5.4 billion won, half of that for the Gwangju Universiade.

Brazil, Japan and China, which will host summer and winter Olympic games in 2016, 2020 and 2022, respectively, are also promoting their events as economical.
