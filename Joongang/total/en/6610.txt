Mr. Koizumi has lived alone for 23 years since his divorce so cooks for himself.
He speaks slowly and his speeches never exceed 5 minutes in length.

A cellular phone accessory with a Koizumi doll and a t-shirt featuring his face are the most popular items.
The raging Koizumi wind has swept the islands of Japan.
He has assented to being the first “presidential-style” prime minister in Japanese history.
However, neighboring countries feel uneasy.
In 1991, when U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle spoke of the expense of troops staying in Japan, Mr. Koizumi said, “Leave if you wish to.”
 His idea was that only after U.S. troops left would Japan care about defending itself.


This group has over 240,000 members and is a favorable voting constituency for the LDP.

Mr. Koizumi dared to cut ties with this group, saying, “One hundred million Japanese citizens are far more important than 260,000 employees of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.”

He speaks slowly and his speeches never exceed 5 minutes in length.

The first floor of the LDP office in Tokyo has a section displaying Koizumi products.
