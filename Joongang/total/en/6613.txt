Some 2,500 Koreans living in New Orleans have lost nearly all their assets to Hurricane Katrina.
The damage is estimated to be about $100 million.


On September 3, 1997, a Vietnam Airlines plane crashed near Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

They guarded the bodies of 21 Korean passengers and shooed away flies swarming around the carnage.

The beginning of the Korean Diaspora was the relocation of 13 farmers and their families to the Russian territory of Posiet Port across the Tumen River in 1863.
