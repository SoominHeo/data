The tsunami that swept the Indonesian island of Sumatra in 2004 registered 8.9 on the Richter scale.
Approximately 250,000 people lost their lives, but far fewer animals were killed, because the animals already knew an earthquake was coming and escaped.

“Age-quake” is a term developed by Paul Wallace, a British demographic scholar.
It uses the earthquake metaphor to visualize the impact of aging populations.
Wallace says, however, that an age-quake is much worse than an earthquake.
When the baby-boom generation retires in 2020, the world economy will “quake” to the equivalent force of a 9.0 on the Richter scale.
Wallace named Korea as the first country to be affected 


Approximately 250,000 people lost their lives, but far fewer animals were killed, because the animals already knew an earthquake was coming and escaped.

In 1994, environmentalist Poul Erih said the world can accommodate only 1.5 billion to 2 billion people, but the earth’s population is already three times over that limit.

The law aims to reduce the impact that Korean society will face within 15 years due to the “age-quake,” but people seem uninterested in it.
