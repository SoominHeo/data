After the war, Parmentier spent 40 years studying potatoes, saying he was able to survive his imprisonment thanks to the tuber.
The value of Parmentier’s research became apparent during the Napoleonic era.
Napoleon Bonaparte believed that a military’s strength came from a self-sufficient food supply.
Parmentier suggested potatoes as a food source, and within 10 years potato production in France rose 15-fold.
