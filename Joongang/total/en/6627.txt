Neuroscientist Eric R. Kandel, the 2000 Nobel Prize winner in medicine, was born in Vienna, Austria.
As a young boy, he was greatly shocked by the holocaust in his homeland, which had been annexed by Nazi Germany.
Unlike Germany, which apologized for its crimes against Jews, Austria has ignored its involvement as if it had completely forgotten the holocaust.
Dr. Kandel, who had moved to the United States In 1939 to escape from Nazi Germany, studied human memory.

Having gained confidence from his sea slug experiments, Dr. Kandel has since 1997 been developing a memory enhancing enzyme named phosphodiesterase-4.
His research is currently at the stage of animal testing, and if successful, could completely cure Alzheimer’s disease and chronic forgetfulness.
When the enzyme was given to a mouse whose age was equivalent to 80 human years, it ran around a maze as quickly and accurately as a young mouse.
Dr. Kandel has said he would like to retrieve the past of his homeland with his medicine.
