On March 17, 2000, when Song Ho-kyung, the vice chairman of North Korea’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, met in Beijing with South Korea’s then-Minister of Culture and Tourism, Park Ji-won, he said, “I have come to prepare ‘a grave accident’ in the history of our division.”

Mr. Song’s comment completely perplexed Mr. Park, who thought at first that he was talking about a disastrous incident like the Korean War.

As Mr. Park later recalled the episode, he thought at first that things were souring.
