But vehicle acceleration pedal problems led to large-scale recall and Toyota’s market share in the United States plummeted to 11.6 percent from 18.1 percent.

Akio admitted his faults and apologized.
Right after the hearing, he met with employees in North America and showed tears.
American media reported he was not crying out of remorse.
But later, Akio said, “I thought I had to protect the customers, dealers and sales outlets in the United States, but in fact, they were protecting me.”
Upon returning to Japan, he called 2,000 executives to the Nagoya headquarters and had a video conference with 9,000 others in regional and overseas offices.
“You’ve all seen the hearing.
Now, we start from beginning again,” he said.
He cried again, but the Toyota employees knew he was crying not because he was falsely accused but that he had an awakening.
Three years later, Toyota returned to the top position.
Volkswagen, which had benefitted from Toyota’s recall five years ago, is under fire for an emission scandal.
And Toyota, which specializes on hybrid cars, can take advantage.
