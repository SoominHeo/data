It was a summit meeting between two nations, but three heads of states got together.
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin received German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder together.
Having been rivals in the presidential election, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin snarled at each other on every issue, and Mr. Schroeder, the guest, had struggled to mend the quarrel.
Such scenes occurred throughout France’s third coalition government.
France always sent two representatives to the European Union summit meeting ― one a leftist, the other a rightist.
No doubt this made other heads of state feel awkward.
Outside France, it is often believed that the country has a semi-presidential form of government, in which the president is in charge of diplomacy and defense while the prime minister is responsible for domestic affairs and finance.
But that is not the case at all.
Depending on the election results, the center of power might shift to the president or the prime minister, but the power is hardly divided.
The president has the power when the governing party is dominant, and the power moves to the prime minister if the opposition is in the majority.
Mr. Jospin never conceded authority over diplomacy and defense to Mr. Chirac.
This was only natural.
The foreign and defense ministers were on the prime minister’s side, so to whom would they likely report first?

France shortened its presidential term from seven years to five, matching the term of the president with those of the assemblymen, to prevent ineffective coalitions.
