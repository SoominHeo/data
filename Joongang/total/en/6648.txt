Japanese Ambassador Toshiyuki Takano left Korea Wednesday after two  years and seven months of service in Seoul.
Mr. Takano is the man who caused a national uproar in February with his remark that Dokdo ― or Takeshima, as he calls it ― was really Japanese territory.


Mr. Takano is the man who caused a national uproar in February with his remark that Dokdo ― or Takeshima, as he calls it ― was really Japanese territory.

During his service in Seoul, there was one thing Mr. Takano feared: dinner gatherings with Koreans.

This is his fourth year in Korea, and he has never refused a bomb shot.

On that occasion, he only stopped because one of his colleagues had to lie down.
