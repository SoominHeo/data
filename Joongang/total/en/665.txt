Ms. Hong, 46, left for New Zealand with two middle school boys in 2010.
With her children attending school there, she found many differences from education in Korea.
One of them was that teachers didn’t use textbooks in class.

However, the need for state-authored textbooks is so far from the reality in classrooms in Korea.
The high school curriculum in Korea focuses on college admission, and a history teacher at a Seoul high school said, “Korean history is a memorization-oriented subject, and school-wide midterm and final tests have multiple-choice questions.
The whole textbook is not covered, and summaries are distributed.
So there is no difference between state-approved and state-authored textbooks.”
Moreover, Korean history will become a required subject on the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in 2017, and the government maintains a policy that 70 percent of the CSAT must be linked to EBS material.
The teacher added, “Just like other subjects, students will focus more on EBS material than on the textbook.”


One of them was that teachers didn’t use textbooks in class.

Moon, 50, said that at her son’s high school in Minnesota, “classes are taught using notebook computers containing various content, not with textbooks.”

Moreover, Korean history will become a required subject on the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in 2017, and the government maintains a policy that 70 percent of the CSAT must be linked to EBS material.

Ms. Yun, 46, is raising four children in Greece, and she is impressed with history education here.
