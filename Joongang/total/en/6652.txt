When Pyongyang severed the cables because the South was late in paying its bill, the South was dependent on the North for 70 percent of the electricity it needed.
But very soon, it seems, electricity might flow from the South to the North.
It doesn’t really matter which way the electricity flows.
But just as Benjamin Franklin would be more wisely remembered as one of America’s founding fathers than as a scientist who discovered that lightning is a discharge of electricity, the people of Korea hope that the electricity sent to the North is used as energy for the unification of the peninsula, and does not go to waste.
