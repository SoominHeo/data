In August of 1988, three months before the U.S. presidential election, Treasury Secretary James Baker, who was running then-Vice President George Bushâ€™s campaign, said on television that he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would raise the interest rate.

Then-Finance Minister Lee Yong-man called for one, but then-Bank of Korea Governor Cho Soon held out to the end.

Mr. Cho was abruptly replaced the following March, with three years left in his term.
