Yanbian Tianci Industrial and Trade Co. Ltd invested 100 million yuan, about $12 million, in Musan mine in North Korea in 2003, producing 600,000 tons of iron ore in 2004 and 2 million tons in 2005.

The Chinese company wants the “dollars in the closet” in Pyongyang, which is estimated at $300 million to $1.5 billion.

In 2003 and 2004, China’s part in North Korea’s official trade soared from 33 percent to 48 percent, and unofficial trade between Shinuiju and Dandong is brisk.

One participant said the situation reminded him of the economic exploitation of neighboring powers in the last days of the Joseon Dynasty.
