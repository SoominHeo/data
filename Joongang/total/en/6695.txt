President John F. Kennedy underwent back surgery twice, but the fact that “he was not able to put on his left sock or shoe by himself and took massive amounts of painkillers every day” was only revealed 30 years after his death.
It shows how sensitive the issue of the president’s health is.
In the summer of 2002, Representative Kim Moo-sung of the Grand National Party had to resign as the chief of staff to presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang because of a comment that just implied the “possibility of a mishap” to then President Kim Dae-jung.
