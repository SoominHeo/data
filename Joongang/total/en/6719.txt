The third united front between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party began yesterday, with the historic meeting in Beijing between Kuomintang Party Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who is also General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

It has been five years since it lost power to the Democratic Progressive Party.

In all three alliances between  the Chinese Communists and the  Kuomintang, the mutual object of resistance has been a foreign influence â€• namely, Japan.

In February, Japan and the United States issued a joint statement encouraging a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue.
