When Daekyo Group CEO Song Ja began teaching at Yonsei University in 1976, having just returned from the United  States, he had his own system.

He increased the number of exams in his classes to four per semester, which was unheard of.

His thinking was that any student could get sick, go into a slump or have a family emergency, so everyone would get one free pass.

But one side effect has been a “grade war” at foreign language high schools, which tend to attract gifted students.

Of course, no system can satisfy everyone, but we shouldn’t choose one that causes pain for the majority.
