The idea of moving some of of the capitalâ€™s functions away from Seoul, which has been the center of the nation for more than 600 years, is controversial because it essentially means restructuring the public consciousness.

The reforms of 1896 divided the eight provinces into north and south.

Now the country has one special city, six metropolitan cities and nine provinces.

Possibilities include eliminating the provinces and creating 60 or 70 regional cities.
