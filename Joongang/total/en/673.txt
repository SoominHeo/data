It had long been Kishi’s ambition to have a more equal alliance with the U.S. Kishi proclaimed a new age in U.S.-Japan relations and began working to revise the Security Treaty in 1958.
The Security Treaty was signed in 1951 and reflected Japan’s status as the defeated and the United States as the victorious.
The U.S.
Forces could exert power in case of domestic unrest in Japan.
In 1960, Kishi removed the clause and stipulated a mutual defense obligation.
The amendment was the critical turning point in postwar Japan and Japan’s rearmament.
When the security treaty was amended, unprecedented anti-government and anti-American protests swept up Japan.
People were concerned about the possibility of war and Kishi’s history as an A-class war criminal.
Japan was divided into the conservative and the liberals.
Chair of the Japan Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma mentioned the security treaty when visiting China and said that American imperialism was the mutual enemy of the people of Japan and China.
The Kishi government mobilized the rightist groups and gangsters to suppress protests.
As the protests were not subjugated, Kishi resigned in June, 1960 after the instrument of ratification were exchanged.
As many as 5.6 million people participated in the protest nationwide.
