Defeated at Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon was contemplating his next move, and decided that England would be more generous to him than any of the other European countries.
He was relying on the British diplomatic philosophy of “splendid isolation.”
This state of “splendid isolation,” which 19th-century British took pride in as a “graceful and glorious” tradition, essentially meant playing the role of a balancer in Europe.
This was not the unintentional, passive isolation that results from being ignored by one’s neighbors, nor was it an exclusionist shutdown of communications.
It was an active diplomatic strategy, aimed at keeping the powerful from having too much influence and at helping smaller, weaker nations survive.
Accordingly,  the British backed France in the post-war negotiations, even though the British had played a key role in ending Napoleon’s domination of the continent.
While Russia and Prussia were blinded by their desire for territory and for postwar compensation, Britain had its eye on the bigger picture: the balance of power in Europe.
As the wealthiest nation of the time, with its empire on which “the sun never set,”  Britain was neither obsessed with money nor interested in acquiring European territory.
Britain’s “splendid isolation” began in earnest in 1805, when its navy defeated the combined French and Spanish fleet at the battle of Trafalgar.
