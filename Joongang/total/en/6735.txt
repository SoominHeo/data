The Yamato was completed on December 16, 1941, eight days after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.
The 72,809-ton, 263-meter-long warship could reach a speed of 27 knots, or about 50 kilometers (31 miles) per hour, and was armed with nine 46-centimeter guns.
The Yamato was the best battleship in the world at the time, and the most technologically advanced.
The Japanese government spent 150 million yen ― two percent of the national budget, at the time ― to assure that it had the most cutting-edge equipment.

Its main guns, which could hit a target at 42 kilometers, had unchallenged power to destroy enemies from a distance.

Only 276 of its 3,300 crew members survived.
