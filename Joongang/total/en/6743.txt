Before 1914, a war used to be a collection of tales of bravery.
When war broke out, young French and German men voluntarily enlisted, dreaming of becoming heroes.
However, the cavalrymen ―adorned with gold-plated buttons and feathered hats ―were nowhere to be found.
Soldiers solemnly marching to the drums of the military band were immediately slaughtered.
The invention of the machine gun changed the way war was waged.
Rushing into a machine gun means an immediate death.
New wars became defensive battles of attrition rather than offense-oriented.
Trenches and barbed wires replaced shields.
In the early stage of the war, French and German armies clashed at the Marne River, north of Paris, and the battle lasted for four years until the war ended.

Just as poet Kim Su-yeong wrote in, “Blue Sky,” Koreans had wondered, “Why does freedom/ Have a scent of blood/ Why a revolution/Is lonely/ Why a revolution/ Has to be so lonely.”
 Two generations later, April 2005 should not be cruel.
April deserves to be a month of brilliant dreams.

In the early stage of the war, French and German armies clashed at the Marne River, north of Paris, and the battle lasted for four years until the war ended.

The two armies dug out trenches several hundreds kilometers-long.

The Battle of the Marne River is remembered as one of the shameful battlefields in the history of war that revealed the recklessness and brutality of war.

The month of April 1960 was truly cruel, as so many young people shed innocent blood.
