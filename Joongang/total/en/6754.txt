In 1998, American chief executives enjoyed some of the most generous stock options.
That year, the average income of chief executives of the top 429 American companies was around $30 million, and a large portion came from stock options.
Millard Drexler, chief executive of the Gap clothing stores at the time, received $7.8 million in salary and bonuses, but his stock options were worth $488 million as the stock soared that year.

However, many people are concerned that offering billions of won to the executives as stock options could lead to a better management, and the government could retrieve several trillion won as a result.
