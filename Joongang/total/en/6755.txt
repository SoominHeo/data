The crowd was there to see the execution of Muhammad Bijeh, a 24-year-old Iranian better known as the “Vampire of the Tehran Desert.”
 Mr. Bijeh was convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering 21 children.

The Chinese Internet newspaper, Sina.com, reported on March 16 that a serial killer had been caught and confessed his crime, including a murder he committed 10 years ago.
However, the man supposedly responsible for the crime was already executed.
The mother of the falsely accused man, who was 21 years old at the time, wailed and said her son had been tortured and forced into making a false confession.
Opponents of the death penalty stand against capital punishment because of its irreversible nature.


 Mr. Bijeh was convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering 21 children.

As the bleeding Mr. Bijeh was dragged to the gallows, the brother of one of his victims lunged and stabbed him.

Every year, at least 1,000 condemned criminals are executed.
