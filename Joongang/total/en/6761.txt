U.S. foreign policy can be explained with two contradictory concepts, isolation and intervention.
Since the days of President George Washington, the traditional foreign policy strategy of the United States has been isolationist.
In his farewell address after his two terms in 1797, President Washington advised, “Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation.

 The Monroe Doctrine was about mutual nonintervention, essentially declaring that the United States would not interfere in European wars or internal affairs.
It also urged Central and South American nations to stand independent from Europe.
Strictly speaking, the Monroe Doctrine was isolationist towards Europe but interventionist toward other countries on the American continent.
A more undisguised move of intervention was the Truman Doctrine.
In 1947 when the Cold War started, President Harry Truman advocated an ideology to protect the world from the communism.
“I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by other pressures.”


In his farewell address after his two terms in 1797, President Washington advised, “Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation.

In 1823, President James Monroe’s declared isolationism would be the country’s “doctrine.”
