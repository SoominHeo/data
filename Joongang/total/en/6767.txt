Solomon had sent 10,000 porters to transport the logs to Jerusalem and build the temple.

He was short of money to pay for the cedar logs to Hiram that he had to hand over 20 cities near Tyre.

The ancients had already built a city here over 6,000 years ago.

The vestige that remains from the civil war is the presence of 14,000 Syrian troops.
