When the University of Gottingen refused to give a faculty position to the famed German mathematician Emmy Noether (1882 to 1935), her mentor David Hilbert derisively said, “After all, the university senate is not a bathhouse.”
 Albert Einstein called Ms. Noether “the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began.”
 However, the professors at the University of Gottingen were against the idea of allowing a woman teacher.
Sophie Germain (1776-1831) had to deal with gender discrimination in mathematics before Ms. Noether.
