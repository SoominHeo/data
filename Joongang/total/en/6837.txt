Koreaâ€™s economic capability is 12th in the whole world, but our universities seem to be in the state of extreme backwardness.

First of all, we have around one month fewer school days per year compared to the United States.

You need to read through at least one book a month to get a grade of C or above.

Korean students acquire the knowledge of less than 100 books 

In Korea, there are few universities that even comply with the ratio of one to 20-25 that is recommended by the Ministry of Education.

The payment for university instructors in the United States is enough to live on if you teach one subject, and enough for a family of two to live on if you teach two subjects.
