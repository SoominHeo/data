When the United States struck Iraq the second time, the U.S. military introduced the so-called “embed program.”

The International Federation of Journalists said that more than 100 journalists have died in accidents or terrorist attacks while gathering news around the world this year.

Since the day the United States began the invasion, 62 war correspondents have been killed in Iraq.
