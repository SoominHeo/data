The lecture hall on the eighth floor was filled with over 100 middle-aged Japanese men and women.
The lecturer was Professor Matsubara Takatoshi of Kyushu University’s Korean Studies Center.
The audience was captivated by the funny, eloquent lecture of the scholar with a short, silvery goatee.
He said that the negative perception of the Japanese towards Korea was going through a revolutionary change in 2004.

How could “Winter Sonata,” whose fans are mostly Japanese housewives, become the leading element of the Korean wave?
According to Ogawa Junko, the NHK producer who introduced the series in Japan, “Winter Sonata” reminded the Japanese audience of the values that have disappeared in Japan, such as romance, love of the family and respect for elders.
However, the more notable point is that the script has been modified.
Originally, the Korean series targeted young viewers in their 20s and 30s, a group in Japan that does not watch television dramas much.
So the producer recreated the tasteful and beautiful dialogues to accommodate the sentiment of the over-40 age group.
