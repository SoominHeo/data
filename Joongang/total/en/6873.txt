During its Civil War, the United States invented a barrel-shaped, one-person submersible.
With the drill attached to the top of the submersible, it could puncture the bottom of the enemy ships and scare enemies with bombs.
A modern submarine was invented in 1861, and its use spread rapidly.

In 1886, the French Navy commissioned the Gymnote, and England, Germany and Japan competed to deploy their own submarines by 1915.

Thatâ€™s why Leonardo da Vinci, who first sketched a design for a submarine, kept his design confidential, saying the invention could bring catastrophic results if it fell into the wrong hands.
