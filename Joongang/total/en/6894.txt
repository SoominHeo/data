“Enemy of the State,” a Hollywood movie released in 1998, starts off as an ordinary action film about an African-American lawyer, Robert Dean, who becomes involved in a murder plot by the National Security Agency.
Then the movie becomes far more interesting as the agency mobilizes satellites to find Dean.
No matter where he goes, the satellites track him down and corner him.
Along with awe for the advancement of the satellite system, the movie invokes fear in viewers that George Orwell’s 1984 has come true.
