The U.S. financial supervisory agencies detail rules for funds that manage the money of more than 100 investors.
Therefore, private equity funds are not required to register with the financial authorities and have no restrictions on where they invest.
Newbridge Capital, the major shareholder of Korea First Bank, and the Carlyle Group, the former major shareholder of KorAm Bank, are well-known private equity firms.
But the adopted version of private equity funds in Korea is different from the American system.
Koreaâ€™s private equity funds must be registered with the financial authorities and have limited investment options.
The financial watchdog will be especially strict on purchases of more than 4 percent of a bank.
