When the world celebrated the start of the new millennium on New Year’s Day in 2000, writer Kim Mi-jin, who had just returned from the Himalayas, put her palms together and said, “namaste.”

She was forced to live in a mental institution for over six years.

 Ashamed of what we had done to her in the first place, we could only utter “namaste” back.
