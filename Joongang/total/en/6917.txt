Kim Yong-jun and Lee Tae-jun are two of the most prominent essayists in the history of Korean literature.

Despite their literary value, their works were forgotten among South Korean readers until 1988, when the government lifted the ban on the works of writers who had defected to the North in the Cold War confrontation.

Usanseonbu, meaning “a man from Mount Seon who loves bullish honesty,” was the first pen name Kim had used.
