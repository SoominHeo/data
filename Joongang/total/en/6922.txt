One day, decades later, the son was married and had children.
He realized that the father’s last telegram was a turning point of his life.
That year, he returned to his hometown for Chuseok, but his father had already passed away.
The father left a letter for his son.
“I have waited for you all my life, but I might have to leave this world now.
I have never forgotten you for a moment.
Since you broke off from me, not one day went by without pain.
