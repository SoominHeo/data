The sum grew to $1 million a month right before the war began.
Such spending was only possible because the CIA had secured a budget of $189 million for non-combatant operations to persuade Iraqi citizens.
Itâ€™s not that the Central Intelligence Agency was always flush with cash.
During the Clinton administration, the CIA always had a tight budget.
Then CIA chief George Tenet had to personally visit the Congressional Budget Office to get $20,000 to purchase communications devices for field officers.


One afternoon in August 2002, a convoy of a Land Cruiser, a Jeep Cherokee and a truck set out in northern Iraq.

The CIA provided the family with $135,000 every month.
