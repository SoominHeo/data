The five-day workweek has begun in earnest, and the vacation season has arrived.
Now that we have a little more free time, why not plan a visit to a secondhand bookstore with family members?
You might find only one magazine, but your participation and care can bring about the industrialization of secondhand bookstores a little sooner.

In March, Book-Off went public and was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Books that are not sold in three months are priced at 100 yen, just under a dollar.

What sets Book-Off stores apart from individually run secondhand bookstores is the bright interior that reminds one of a convenience store.

Book-Off estimates a store would be profitable in any major city with more than 5,000 Japanese residents.
