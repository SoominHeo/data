According to Koran 2:190, Allah commanded, “You may fight in the cause of God against those who attack you, but do not aggress.
God does not love the aggressors.”
 The Islamic rules of war, which have been refined and respected for over 14 centuries, designate that Muslim fighters should only fight combatants and never kill civilians.
The Islamic militant group that kidnapped and murdered Kim Sun-il is Jamaat Al-Tawhid wal Jihad, meaning “monotheism and holy struggle.”
 It took life away from Mr. Kim, who had no intention of fighting back.
It betrayed the order of the one and only God.
By killing a civilian, the group broke the law of the religion they are fighting to protect.
The kidnappers wore the masks of Muslim fighters, but they were not Muslim.
Mr. Kim’s funeral took place in his hometown of Busan on Wednesday.
As his soul ascends to heaven, he might have thought, “It is God who takes away life.
I only managed the life within me.
It is a sin if one has taken his own life or someone else’s.”


Until they bring true pleasure and become second nature, it cannot be said that such spirited behaviors are one’s own.

According to Koran 2:190, Allah commanded, “You may fight in the cause of God against those who attack you, but do not aggress.
