Not only Jews but also financial criminals and dictators flocked to Swiss banks to hide their illegally accumulated money.
As institutions in a permanently neutral state, Swiss banks focused on protection of secrecy, but their ethics were called into question when it was revealed in the late 1990s that they had confiscated the unclaimed savings of the Jewish victims of the Nazis.
A security guard of a Swiss bank disclosed a pile of documents that were supposed to have been destroyed.
The documents included transactions made in Berlin before World War II.

In 1997 alone, Swiss banks paid over 300 million dollars to settle with the survivors of the clients.
The confidential accounts in Swiss banks do not earn interest.
