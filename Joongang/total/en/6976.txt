In 993, Khitan general Hsiao led 800,000 troops to Goryeo and demanded that it surrender.
By the late 10th century, Khitans had already established the Liao Dynasty, which overwhelmed the Sung Dynasty.
The royal court of Goryeo debated whether to resist the invasion or to surrender the land north of Seogyeong, todayâ€™s Pyeongyang, to Kitai.
But General Seo Hui advocated that Goryeo delay the decision until it understood the precise reason for the invasion.
And he visited the Khitan camp by himself to negotiate.
The manifested reason for the invasion was that Goryeo had taken over the frontier lands of Kitai that had belonged to Goguryeo, and that the court of Goryeo served the Sung Dynasty.
General Seo explained that Goryeo was a successor to Goguryeo.
Also, he said that Goryeo could not have diplomatic relations with the Liao Dynasty because the Jurchens occupied the region between Goryeo and Kitai.
After seven days of negotiation, Goryeo agreed to serve Kitai and take the six counties in Gangdong, which were under Jurchen control, in return.
