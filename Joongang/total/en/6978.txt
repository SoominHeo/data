Attractive males earned 14 percent more than plain males, on average.
The difference was smaller for females, at 9 percent.


A team led by an economics professor, Daniel Hamermesh at the University of Texas at Austin, surveyed over 3,600 people for a paper published in 1997.

Based on submitted photographs, the team categorized the sample population into three groups, good-looking, average and plain.

Attractive males earned 14 percent more than plain males, on average.

The difference was smaller for females, at 9 percent.

The gap was even larger among married subjects; overweight married women earned 25 percent less than married females of normal weight.
