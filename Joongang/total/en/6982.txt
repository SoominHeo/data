On May 10, two North Korean diplomats entered the Korean American Federation in Los Angeles, escorted by State Department officials and police.
With the special protection of the U.S. government, Jo Kil-hong and Pak Pu-ung of the North Korean mission at the United Nations were visiting Los Angeles to accept a donation from the Korean-American community for victims of the Yongcheon train explosion in April.
Over 30 policemen and State Department officials appeared on site to guard the North Korean dignitaries, because some conservative groups had staged a violent protest there.
