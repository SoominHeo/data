President Andrew Jackson, who was elected in 1828, believed the spoils system to be a principle of democracy.
The official posts were considered trophies of war for the winners of elections.
In the United States, the spoils system was prevalent not only in the federal government but also in state and local governments.
After President James Garfield was assassinated in 1881 by a disappointed job seeker, the U.S. government reformed the system.
