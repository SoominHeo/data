India is a melting pot of religion, and the Hindus, 80 percent of the population, do not wear turbans.
In spite of their small numbers, the minority Sikhs came to be known as typical Indians because of their unique appearance and strong personalities, which leave a vivid impression.
Sikhism is a unique religion.
“Sikh” means a pupil or disciple in an ancient Indian language.
Sikhism emerged in the Punjab region, the cradle of an ancient civilization in the upper Indus, in the 15th century.
The religion is a combination of monotheistic Islam and polytheistic Hinduism.
When Guru Nanak Devi Ji came to India, he created Sikhism as a third way in order to spread Islam and relieve the religious tension with the Hindus in the region.
