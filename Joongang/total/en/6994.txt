Since Washington recently decided to pull some troops of the 2d Infantry Division from Korea to be transferred to Iraq, we are increasingly hearing expressions of concern.

But these assumptions lack validity, since in the 1970s Washington had pulled the 7th Infantry Division and three Air Force squadrons from Korea even though Korea had sent troops to Vietnam to help the U.S. war effort there.
