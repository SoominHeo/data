President Park Geun-hye is to attend the military parade for China’s Victory Day on Sept. 3.
To show its national strength, Beijing is preparing the most impressive parade.
Until the late ’80s, Korea was no different.
But since the Roh Tae-woo administration, the National Armed Forces Day parade only happened once every three years.


Until the 1980s, thousands of middle and high school students were called to welcome the president.

They said that it would collapse in two months.
