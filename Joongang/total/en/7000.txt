In 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy had to make a drastic decision during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

He had later said that he stood by the moderates because he saw a 50 to 1 chance of a nuclear war.

In the Soviet Union, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev found himself in a similar dilemma between the hard-liners and moderates.

When each White House aide and security council member produced his version of assumptions and options, Mr. Kennedy recommended that they read “The Guns of August,” by Barbara Tuchman.
