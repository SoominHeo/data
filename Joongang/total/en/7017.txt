The suppressors of the April demonstration claimed that they had to protect the market economy system from the leftist mavericks.

Aside from the election, another significant piece of news in April was the itinerary of U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, who concluded a tour of Northeast Asia with a visit to Korea at the time of the election.
