Of that total, 4,400 were hospitalized and 69 died of cryptosporidiosis, the disease caused by the pathogen.
What makes Cryptosporidium parvum more unusual is that mass outbreaks of the disease are more common in developed countries, where the infection rate is relatively low.
Maybe people residing in a clean environment are not immune to unsanitary influences and are more susceptible to infection.
A similar phenomenon was found in a study conducted by a research team at the University of Hamburg in 1995.
The researchers studied the allergy symptoms of 8,000 children aged 9 to 12.
They found that children in the former West Germany, who grew up in a relatively cleaner environment, had two to three times more atopy and pollen allergy than the children of the former East Germany.
