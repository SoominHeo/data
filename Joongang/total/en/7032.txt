In the 1930s, the heyday of the Chinese merchants, nearly 120,000 ethnic Chinese resided in Korea.
But after independence from Japan, new regulations and discriminative treatment discouraged the local Chinese community, and it dwindled to about 22,000 people.

The fall of Chinatown is an exhibition of the exclusive structure of Korean society.
The Chinatown in Sogong-dong, Seoul, disappeared in the early 1970s during a project to rebuild the central area.
The Seoul city government had promised that it would build a new 18-story Chinese community center in return for clearing a Chinese business center in front of City Hall.
But the promise was not kept, and the frustrated Chinese merchants sold off their remaining land and left the country, recalls Son Jeong-mog, a professor emeritus of the University of Seoul who was a city official at the time.


But after independence from Japan, new regulations and discriminative treatment discouraged the local Chinese community, and it dwindled to about 22,000 people.

Currently, the only Chinatown in the country is in Incheon, but the number or residents there has decreased from several thousand to a mere 300 or so.
