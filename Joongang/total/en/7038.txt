As his nickname, “Le Cost Killer,” suggests, he effectively carried out drastic restructuring unheard of in Japanese business, closing five plants and laying off 21,000 employees, or 14 percent of the entire work force.
Following Mr. Ghosn’s efforts, other Japanese companies began a full-scale restructuring.

While 21,000 workers were laid off, they were either hired by a subsidiary or a contractor company or offered a position with a lower wage.
