In the mid-20th century, Wilson Bentley, an American farmer and snow crystal photomicrographer, was fascinated by the beauty of snow and captured over 6,000 images.
When the temperature is around minus 1 to 5 degrees centigrade, a relatively mild cold day, small snow crystals will stick to one another to create bigger snowflakes, which are easy to form into a ball.


He hung a strand of rabbitâ€™s fur in a temperature-controlled laboratory that could be cooled to minus 30 degrees centigrade.

Mr. Nakatani successfully completed the experiment in 1936, a great leap in the study of ice and snow.
