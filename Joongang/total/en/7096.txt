German scientist Wernher von Braun became interested in rockets after he read a science fiction book, “A Trip to the Moon,” when he was 12.
It was the Nazi government under Adolf Hitler that helped him pursue his dream.
Walter Dornberger, an officer in an artillery regiment, picked Mr. von Braun to develop a long-range missile with liquid fuel.
The scientist worked on the missile, the V-2, during World War II,  and in the last days of the war the new weapon rained down on London.

Having learned the destructive power of missiles and nuclear weapons, Washington and Moscow began to wonder if they could inflict a fatal blow on the enemy by combining the two weapons.

But more than 30 years later, President George W. Bush has brought the issue up again.
