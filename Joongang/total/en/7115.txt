But even during peacetime, nations set up complicated visa rules against third-world nations and unfriendly countries, to protect labor markets and for security reasons.
Koreans do not require a visa to enter most European and Southeast Asian countries.
Among the countries Koreans consider friends, the United States and Japan are the exceptions that require visas from Koreans.
While a Korean citizen needs a visa to enter Russia and China, Koreans do not feel these two countries to be close friends as the United States and Japan are.
Regardless of the purpose of the visit, espionage or illegal business activity would be punished by law.
But between nations that claim to be allies, operating a visa system for bureaucratic reasons is insulting.
From the beginning of 2004, all Koreans who enter the United States are required to be fingerprinted at the airport.
Most Europeans and the citizens of countries that have no-visa agreements with the United States are exempt from the fingerprinting.
As an ally of the United States, Korea has sent forces to Iraq to help the American-led war, and has practically decided to send an additional 3,000 soldiers.
