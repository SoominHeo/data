With the slogan “Strong Russia,” Mr. Putin was named to succeed President Boris Yeltsin in 2000.
As soon as he took office, he issued a series of hard-line orders.
He retaliated against Chechen rebels and arrested oligarchs when they demanded a voice in politics.
He did not mind international criticism when he refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and declared the right to engage in preemptive attacks like the United States.
As a result, the party supported by Mr. Putin scored a landslide victory in last Sunday’s parliamentary election.
Mr. Putin seems sure to be re-elected in March, and some even predict that he will attempt to revise the constitution so that he can serve three consecutive terms.


Born a son of a poor laborer in 1952, Mr. Putin was skinny and small.

On his 13th birthday, he received a book called “Shield and Sword,” a novel that depicted fictional KGB spy Alexander Belov as a hero.
