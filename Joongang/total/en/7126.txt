But there remains one problem yet to be solved, that of the president’s call for a vote of confidence in his leadership.
It seems that the Blue House is also agonizing over the issue.
It is in a dilemma because the Constitutional Court has in effect already ruled that the idea is unconstitutional.
It can neither insist on a vote, nor can it go back on what the president promised officially.
President Roh Moo-hyun declared that he would follow the advice of the political community.
It is also awkward, though, that the president’s promise to the people should be decided by political parties.
In the end, there is no way for the president to take responsibility for the allegations of corruption against his former aides.
But this issue should be solved before the year ends.
Leaving it in limbo would only hinder the president and could stir political instability.
The only solution is for the president to declare that a popular vote of confidence is unconstitutional and that he retracts his announcement.
First, it would be desirable for government legal organs such as the Ministry of Justice to officially tell the president that such a vote could be unconstitutional.
The president could then retract his proposal based on this report.
It was wrong of the Blue House to have dragged this problem this far.
What kind of a government takes two months to figure out whether its policy is unconstitutional?

First, the president must exercise prudence.

First the allegations were only focused on the former Blue House secretary Choi Do-sul but now they have come to include other acquaintances of the president such as Kang Geum-won, Seon Bong-sul and Lee Gwang-jae.
