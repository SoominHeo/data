The vertushka was initiated in 1996, when President Boris Yeltsin provided direct phone lines to businessmen who made donations and helped boost public opinion during his re-election campaign.
Before the vertushka, the kremlyovka was the most coveted hotline in Russia.
It was an official telephone line among government officials, not between private companies and the government.
Each head of a government agency or state-run research center and political big shot had the kremlyovska at home.
If you wanted to know a Russian bureaucratâ€™s status you checked what kind of kremlyovka he had on his desk.
Business giants emerging after the dissolution of the Soviet Union competed to secure material and human networks that could connect them to the Kremlin.
But even as the government moved from a totalitarian system to democracy, it could not expand its network of kremlyovka to the private sector.
So Mr. Yeltsin came up with the vertushka.
Companies with a vertushka can directly contact Kremlin insiders.
Having a vertushka is a badge of honor and a shield at the same time.
The hammer and sickle at the center of the dial plate symbolize that the owner of the desk is a powerful businessman who is connected to, is managed by, or is influencing the Kremlin.
Currently, 28 companies have the coveted vertushka.
