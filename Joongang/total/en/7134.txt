Molotov cocktails started to appear in street demonstrations in Korea in 1983, when college students stepped up their protests against the authoritarian government of the time.

As the use of Molotov cocktails grew in the mid-80s, the police made frequent use of the gas.

Five years have passed, and all the tools have gone rusty.

The street demonstrations by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in downtown Seoul on Nov. 9 has shown that the police forbearance was a dangerous decision.
