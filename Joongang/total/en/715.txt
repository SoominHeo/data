Just like 70 years ago, Korea’s best asset is the public.
We need to invest more on people to allow them to succeed.
That’s why it is especially regrettable and tragic that 410,000 young Koreans between ages 20 and 29 are without jobs.
Korean education has been lost now for quite some time.
At this rate, the growth engine that is our people may die away.
We don’t have much time left to plan Korea’s next 100 years.
