If you are reading this now, it means that you are more blessed than 2 billion people in this world, who cannot read.
And if you can recognize all these blessings with a smiling face, you are more blessed than those who cannot.


One man was allowed to sit up once in the afternoon so that fluid could be drained from his lung.

One day a few weeks later, a nurse found that the man beside the window had peacefully breathed his last.

The statistics of blessing:  If you woke up this morning with health, it means that you are much more blessed than those 1 million people who died this week in the world.
