Known as “the father of modern management,” Peter Drucker rose to intellectual stardom in 1946, when he published his “Concept of the Corporation.”

 Written under the sponsorship of General Motors, the tome was the first scientific analysis of a major global corporation.

The name SK immediately reminds us of the Academic Quiz Show, which the company has sponsored since 1973.
