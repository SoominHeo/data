Those were the secret orders that King Gwanghaegun of Korea’s Joseon Dynasty gave in 1618 to Kang Hong-rip, commander of the Joseon reinforcement army that was dispatched at the request of China’s Ming Dynasty.
For both king and subject the wish was the same: they did not want to confront Later Jin Dynasty,  the country of the Manchus and predecessor of the Ching Dynasty, which was on the rise.

A mere 10 years earlier they had sent an army to Korea to help defeat its enemy, Japan, during the two Japanese invasions of the peninsula.
