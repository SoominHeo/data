Shortly thereafter, the police arrested a 17-year-old youth and soon announced that he had confessed to the second rape-murder.
The police asked Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist, to use the techniques of genetic identification that he had pioneered to see if the youth could also have been the murderer of the first girl.
Mr. Jeffreys, who studied the implications for kinship identification in the human genetic structure, knew that human DNA was 99.9-percent identical in different persons.
