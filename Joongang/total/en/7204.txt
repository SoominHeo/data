Ramen is a popular Japanese noodle soup, and a ramenist, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, is one who visits at least 200 ramen restaurants a year to taste different kinds of ramen noodles.

One can be called a true ramenist when he can taste a new kind of ramen and produce a respectable comment.

If you can tell the ingredients from one bite, you are a beginner ramenist.

Japanese are known for devotion and concentration; that one-track mentality leads to a lot of experts in narrow fields.
