The material for the play comes from an incident that happened in 1701 during the Tokugawa era of Japan.
Forty-seven samurai vassals of a lord who had been driven unjustly to commit hara-kiri, pleaded with the other lords for a year to regain their lord’s honor.
Because nobody wanted to hear their appeal, the samurai raided their enemy’s manor and decapitated him.
After they presented the head to the soul of their own lord, all of them committed hara-kiri themselves on orders of the shogun, the highest lord of feudal Japan.
They showed their loyalty both to their dead lord and to the shogun.
The incident was turned into a play nearly the moment it happened, and is still popular in Japan, perhaps because the pathetic situation of the samurai, unconditionally faithful to the mores of the age, still resonates among Japanese.
