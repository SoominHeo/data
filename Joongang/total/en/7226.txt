On Dec. 12, 2000, the world was looking closely at the United States Supreme Court.

The court was sharply divided, ruling for Mr. Bush 5-4.

According to the report, the two judges were worried that Mr. Gore would select liberals as their replacements, even though they were said to have been considering retirement for age and health reasons.

“The Pelican Brief,” a novel by John Grisham, begins with the assassinations of two Supreme Court judges.
