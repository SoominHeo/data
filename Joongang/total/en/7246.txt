Korea’s gross domestic product last year was larger than the combined GDPs of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malay-sia and Thailand, the so-called new four dragons of Asia.
Who achieved this success?
Our people did.
This was possible because there were numerous hard-working industrial workers like the Korean national soccer squad and there were leaders like Mr. Hiddink who had to agonize and decide.
Today, we are preoccupied with witchhunting as if everything that happened in the past was wrong.
Is it right to say, as if there was no one who did things right, that there are only people who should be sent to prison?
If we think things over with peace of mind, there were and are many qualified people like Mr. Hiddink in Korea.
Our national climate, in which we hardly acknowledge other people’s merits and nurture leaders, is hindering the emergence of many Hiddinks.
How can we expect to have leaders worthy of respect without fostering leaders and acknowledging them?
Mr. Hiddink came to Korea to take up his new post in January 2001 and led the Korean soccer team in 32 international tournaments until May 2002, just before the beginning of the World Cup.
