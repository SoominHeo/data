Western demography scholars estimate that the world population exceeded 500 million in 1650.
In 1800, 900 million people were living on the earth, and 1.6 billion were estimated to occupy our planet in 1900.

It is likely that the percentage of poor people was even greater in the past.
Thus, most of the estimated 72 billion people who have appeared on the earth were not free from poverty.
Thomas Malthus, a British economist, warned about rapid population growth in a 1798 essay.
He argued that famine and poverty are natural outcomes because food supplies grew according to an arithmetic progression while population grew geometrically.


In 1800, 900 million people were living on the earth, and 1.6 billion were estimated to occupy our planet in 1900.

The International Labor Organization recently said that about half of the world population today lives on less than $2 a day.
