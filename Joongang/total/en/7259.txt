The Russian leader’s visit to England means much to the history of diplomacy between the two countries.

After the marriage between the two royal houses, an “English fad” swept Russia.

After the queen’s visit, the two countries tried to plan the visit of the Russian leader to England as a final symbol of the friendship that had been completely restored.

British Petroleum PLC of Great Britain and Tumen Oil Co. of Russia signed a $6 billion contract for supplying oil and gas.

While we can call the Russian leader’s visit to Great Britain 129 years ago “the fusion of royal red blood,” this year we can name it “the fusion of black-gold blood.”
