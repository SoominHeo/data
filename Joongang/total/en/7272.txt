In fact, fossils of Australopithecus, who are believed to have lived 1 million to 4 million years ago, have been found only in Africa.
But the immediate ancestors of modern humans are Homo sapiens, not Australopithecus.
Fossils of Homo sapiens have been unearthed equally in each continent.
Because of this, the Africa origination theory is still controversial.
Recently an international research team announced that it had discovered 160,000-year-old fossilized skulls of Homo sapiens in Ethiopia.
Before the discovery, 100,000-year-old fossils were the limit of their antiquity.
