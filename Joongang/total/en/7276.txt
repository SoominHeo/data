New York was my second hometown; it gave me money and a reputation in the Korean community.
Those 17 years were a period during which I dashed toward power.


Beyond the ridgeline, three peaks called Baekundae, Insubong and Manggyeongdae are laughing hand-in-hand.

I made enormous efforts to make money for the next 17 years since.

Those 17 years were a period during which I dashed toward power.

The first inter-Korean summit, which I helped Kim Dae-jung with, will be recorded as a great achievement in Korean history, no matter what anyone says.

Kim Dae-jung is sick, and people who swarmed around him like flies are departing one by one.
