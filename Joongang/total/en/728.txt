As I was walking on the Sejong-daero of central Seoul around 1 p.m. on Monday, I felt dizzy, because of the large national flags hung on the facades of most buildings along the road.

Lotte said it consulted with relevant government offices two months ago about the giant flag, well before the ownership dispute started.

During the 2002 World Cup, the national flag was seen everywhere in Korea, including in fashion, as a manifestation of Korean pride.
