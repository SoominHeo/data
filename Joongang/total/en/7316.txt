Luciano had lunch with Masseria in a quiet restaurant in New York for three hours without Masseria’s guards.
Luciano’s men  attacked Masseria while Luciano went to the bathroom to set up an alibi.
To kill Maranzano, a distrustful person, Luciano trained four of his men for several months, spending $80,000, and installed a spy in the Maranzano camp.


In 1934, Mafia bosses from all over the United States swarmed into the Hotel Waldorf Astoria in New York City, where the details of the nationwide criminal syndicate were ironed out.

The boss of the bosses who presided over that meeting was Charlie Luciano (1897-1962), who was from Sicily.

On his way to the throne, Luciano was involved in the deaths of such legendary first generation Mafia bosses as G. Masseria and S. Maranzano.
