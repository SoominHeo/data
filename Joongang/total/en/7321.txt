Jews, who had lived on the European continent for more than 2,000 years, crossed the Atlantic during periodic persecutions there.
The biggest migration was by Jews from Germany.
They headed for the new continent in the early 19th century, expecting oppression after the defeat of Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo.
At that time, more than 300,000 left Germany for the United States and other Jews in Eastern Europe and Russia followed the same path, the latter group called “Ashkenazi.”

Another big migration of Jews from Europe occurred in the early 20th century with the advent of Nazism in Germany.
During that migration, such eminent people as Albert Einstein moved to the United States.
It has been often said they have led the world, leveraging their position in the United States.
From basic science to banking to literature and the performing arts, Jews play prominent roles in the United States.
More than 20 percent of wealthy Americans are Jews; they make up 7.5 percent of chief executives of large businesses, 35 percent of major journalists, and 60 percent of movie producers and directors.
Paul Wolfowitz, the most hawkish of the U.S. officials who devised the Iraqi war plan, Elliot Abrams, the National Security adviser for the Middle East and Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, are all Jews.


At that time, more than 300,000 left Germany for the United States and other Jews in Eastern Europe and Russia followed the same path, the latter group called “Ashkenazi.”

More than 80 percent of Jews now in the United States are of Ashkenazi heritage.
