Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, introduced the concept of anomie because he lived in one of the most radical and unstable times in history.
In his youth, he witnessed the Paris Commune, formed in 1876, a radical political group of the proletariate when France was still under the influence of the French Revolution.
Durkheim, who was Jewish, felt sickened when Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish French army officer, was accused of being a spy 
The meaning of anomie is the condition in which no rules or moral standards exist.
Chaos spreads as old social rules are abandoned and innovations abound, but it was first used to describe irregular conditions that caused social deviations.
The most notable such social deviation that Durkheim recognized was suicide; he wrote a book on the subject in 1897 that made the term “anomie” better known to readers.
