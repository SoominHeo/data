A few years ago, I had a chance to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building in New York.
I was expecting a romantic mood since it was the location of a rendezvous in the film “Sleepless in Seattle.”
While the view of Manhattan from the observatory was breathtaking, the fence around the terrace was rather an eyesore.
The three-meter (10-foot) fence was leaning inward at the top, and I thought it was too much to keep visitors safe.
But I later found out that the cautionary measure was understandable.
Since the observation deck opened in 1931 and until the fence was put up in 1947, more than 30 people have attempted suicide by jumping off from the building.
They may have wanted to end their lives at this beautiful place.
Many suicide sites are known for beautiful scenery.
French writer Martin Monestier’s 2007 book “Suicides” list the top 10 suicide sites, including the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

In 2012, the city of Seoul launched the suicide prevention campaign, “Bridge of Life,” starting from Mapo Bridge.

And the city of Seoul has been holding a contest for suicide prevention ideas since Aug. 7.
