In A.D. 762, during the Abbasid Dynasty, the second caliph, or emperor, Abu Jafar Al-Mansur, chose the village as the capital city, and a new era began.
Baghdad flourished as the cultural center of Islam while other European cities were still in the Dark Ages.
But the 37th caliph, Mustasim, who reigned from 1242 to 1258, had to surrender to the Mongolian empire, which, at that time, was the world’s most powerful nation.
Mongolian forces, led by Ghengis Khan’s grandson, attacked the city in 1258 and before the intrusion Khan’s grandson wrote a warning letter to the caliph.
