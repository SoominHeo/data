Sikorsky went on to refine his design and registered 38 patents in all.
The military was the first to recognize the vehicleâ€™s mobility potential, that it could maneuver left and right, back and forth and up and down -- in the air.
In July 1940, the U.S. Army Air Corps awarded Mr. Sikorsky a contract to deliver  refined versions of the VS-300 for two-man crews.
When the United States entered World War II, Mr. Sikorsky began delivery, and most of the helicopters were used in noncombat roles to transport wounded soldiers or gather intelligence.
It was during the Korean War in 1950 that helicopters were first armed with machine guns and rockets during combat missions.
Helicopters continue to wield their might in the battlefields of the 21st century.
About 900 helicopters of the coalition forces are at the forefront of the assault against Iraq.
