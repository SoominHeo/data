In September 1993, Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the White House in Washington to sign a peace treaty.

Mr. Arafat told Mr. Rabin that the struggle for peace was the most difficult war of all, and Mr. Rabin replied that he would pray for the day when the conflict between the two parties was ended.
