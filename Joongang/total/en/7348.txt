Sixty years have passed since penicillin made its debut, and the battle between antibiotics and sexually transmitted diseases continues.
According to a recent report of the National Health Insurance Corporation, the number of people with sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea and syphilis, is growing fast.
As quinoline antibiotics, particularly effective for gonorrhea, began losing strength, the number of gonorrhea cases in Korea rose from 47,000 in 2000 to 82,000 in 2001, and there are reports of new bacteria that are too strong to be killed with any currently used antibiotics.
