Furthermore, these people have never had competition for survival.
Thus, they would not know the basic fear of people who have to survive living through market competition.
These professionals have lived by dominating innocent and ignorant students, citizens and  clients.
The high-profile people think those who belong to the lower ranks would not stand up against them because they are right.
So professional people have the habit of forcing others to listen to their omnipotent opinions.

It is hard to expect that they will sympathize with an ordinary citizen’s sufferings from regulations and the tyranny of ignorant civil servants.
They are the kinds who come up with such instant answers as: If there is over supply in the market, “We should promote a big deal”; and, if something is not working in conglomerates, then they say, “The debt ratio of those companies should be decreased to 200 percent.”


Scholars, government officials and lawyers have one thing in common.

Their career and job have been guaranteed once they had passed the national examination or acquired professional licenses.
