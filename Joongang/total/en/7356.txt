In the store I saw a heap of cone-shaped hats, and I bought one because everybody else did.

I had no idea, however, why children wore those peaked hats on the first day of school.

I ponder sometimes the meaning of accepting foreign culture, and I wonder how long it took for marketers to start promoting dunce caps for children on the first day of school and chocolates for Valentineâ€™s Day.
