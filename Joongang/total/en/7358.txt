The length of a bud’s overnight growth is 10 million times the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
A day corresponds to nearly 100,000 seconds.


Instead of assigning a chapter in a textbook on atoms, I often tell students to observe how much one bud grows overnight.

How many atoms per second have to be added for that growth?

How small is a hydrogen atom, which accounts for two-thirds of a water molecule?
