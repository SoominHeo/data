But in reality, such legal disputes between the two types of fathers are taking place across the globe.
The sperm industry has prospered since 1978, when the first “test-tube” baby was born as a result of in vitro fertilization at a hospital in Britain.
Because one syringe-full of semen contains 100 million sperms, the reproductive cells are a biological resource that can be tapped limitlessly.
From a business point of view, the sperm industry is a high-value-added one that requires very little cost for raw materials.
During the early days of artificial insemination, people thought that biological fathers did not have legal responsibility as fathers.
At that time, sperm donation was considered a transaction of commodities.
But as the sperm industry booms, such a notion began to change.
In the United States and Europe, new types of sperm banks have mushroomed, offering home delivery of sperms.
These agencies distribute to women leaflets that provide information about sperm donors, and cart sperm to the home of an aspiring mother to impregnate her.
Since 2001, some countries, including Switzerland, have passed laws that require a sperm donor to be identified.
