A few days before taking his own life with a pistol in the summer of 1993, Mr. Foster wrote a memorandum expressing the enormous pressure, frustration and agony he had to endure as a presidential staff member.
At that time, Mr. Foster was being attacked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the political opposition and the media.
Most of all, there were constant disputes over politics and power struggles between hardliners and moderates at the White House that wore him out.
Mr. Foster was investigated in relation to the White House's Travel Office scandals and questioned about his political responsibility for the two unsuccessful nominations of candidates for attorney general.

Washington politicians and the media made Mr. Foster a scapegoat in order to tame the first couple from Arkansas, who were unfamiliar and seemed arrogant.
