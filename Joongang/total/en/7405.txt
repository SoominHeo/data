The roof is half the height of the building, which is about the same as a 10-story apartment building.
Up close, the building does not look as elegant as it does from a distance.Entering the building, you are once again struck by the sight of the ceiling as high as that of a gymnasium, smooth marble pillars and the interior of gold phoenix carvings.
There are about 10 large rooms, including two grand banquet halls each with a capacity of 100 people, a small reception room used for meetings between heads of the political parties, and a number of medium-size conference rooms.
After a cabinet meeting or a large reception, this "palace" covering 8,461 square meters, with two floors and one basement floor, becomes as quiet as a Buddhist temple.
Only the president and 10 employees are there.

Former president Roh Tae-woo ordered the construction of a new Blue House, embarrassed that the presidential residence lacked space for U.S. President George Bush's accompanying party during a visit in 1989.
Before that construction, the Blue House was an elegant building of 1,934 square meters.


Only the president and 10 employees are there.

The presidential secretaries, the president's closest advisers, and a staff of about 400 are scattered in other buildings 500 meters from the main office building.
