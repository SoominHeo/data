Russian authorities have announced that the second phase of the railroad development project was complete and that they would begin working on the third phase, the connection of the railroad with rail lines on the Korean Peninsula.
The Siberian railroad project is closely connected with Russia's advance toward the east.
The Siberian region that the railroad traverses comprises about one-fourth of the Asian continent, and is abundant in natural resources like coal, oil, nickel and bronze.

The first Westerners came to Siberia in the 16th century.

In 1891, construction of the Siberian railroad was started as an effort to further Siberia's economic development and Russia's hold over the region.
