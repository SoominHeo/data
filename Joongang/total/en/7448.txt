But many Germans, who generally respect traffic regulations, drive at about 55 kilometers per hour.
The police do not seem to mind when a driver exceeds the speed limit by 5 kilometers an hour or so, and it appears that traffic surveillance cameras ignore cars traveling at 10 percent over the limit.

But there are situations where all cars on German roads drive at 50 kilometers an hour.

Ten years ago, for example, a Korean man was stopped by a German policeman while driving at night, speeding well over the limit.

The survey showed that 86 percent of German citizens respected the police.
