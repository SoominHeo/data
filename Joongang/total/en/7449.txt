Mr. Chung had no intentions of creating a "farm of migratory birds" when he launched the landfill project in 1984.
He wanted to build an industrial zone and promoted the reclamation project to create an artificial freshwater lake to supply water to the factories.
But the area was gradually developed into farmland when the government banned the creation of the industrial zone.
A huge freshwater lake, endless rice paddies and plenty of food make the landfill ideal for migratory birds.
Early winter is the time when birds crowd the landfill in the greatest number.
The Korean Peninsula is home to 400 species of birds but fewer than 100 species are permanent residents here.


The Korean Peninsula is home to 400 species of birds but fewer than 100 species are permanent residents here.

About 100 species of birds fly to the peninsula during the winter.

Roughly 300,000 birds gather at Cheonsu Bay.

Most of the winter birds hatch their eggs in Siberia in early May when the ice melts and buds sprout.
