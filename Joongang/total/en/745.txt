When I was in high school in the mid-1980s, I read a success story of Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho in a  newspaper and was deeply moved.

If Japan’s Lotte wants to control Korea’s Lotte, with revenue 15 times larger, they should at least show love for Korea.

Three of the four grandparents of Shin Dong-bin’s children are Japanese.
