That boldness earned the Twins victories in games 2 and 5.
A good example was the squeeze bunt in the eighth inning of Game 5, when the Twins were already leading 7-4.


And the Twins' players, who had played seven games more than the Lions on their march through the playoffs, were already exhausted.

It was different from the strategy used during the regular season, when about five pitchers rotate as starters.

Lee Seung-yeop of the Lions, the best hitter in Korean baseball, had just 2 hits in 20 at-bats during the series until his final trip to plate in Game 6.

That boldness earned the Twins victories in games 2 and 5.
