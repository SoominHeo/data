Deng Xiaoping revived the tradition of the military parade in Tiananmen in 1984.
He had pushed out Mao’s designated successor, Hua Guofeng, and won in a struggle against conservatives such as Chin Win to establish himself as the leader of China.
The military parade was a ritual that declared the strength of Deng’s regime.
Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao held military parades to mark the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the People’s Republic of China.
As the power succession in China became systematic, the cycle of military parades became a custom.
According to this custom, the next military parade should be in 2019 for the 70th anniversary.
However, Xi Jinping is holding a large-scale military parade on Sept. 3, less than three years into his administration.
