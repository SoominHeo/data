According to Da Vinci, human feet, which function in precision as a part of a body's machinery, are comprised of 52 bones, 76 joints and 64 muscles.

The steady impact of a marathoner's feet support 120 percent of his weight while walking and three times that while running.

Lee Bong-ju, 32, the gold medalist in the men's marathon at the Asian Games in Busan, does not have perfect feet.

Three layers of sponge are attached to the insoles of Sortie Lees, easing the impact while running.

Mr. Lee said that he will enter the marathon at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
