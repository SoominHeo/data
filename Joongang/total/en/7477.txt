In 1910, Chaim Azriel Weizmann (1874-1952) by chance discovered a bacteria that transforms sugar to acetone.
Since acetone was necessary for manufacturing ammunition, the discovery contributed largely to the Allied force's victory in World War I. Weizmann later became the first president of Israel.

The story about James Watt (1749-1823), who invented the steam engine after watching as a child the lid of a pot being rattled by the water boiling inside is probably not true.
