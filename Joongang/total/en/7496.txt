Jesse Owens, the legendary track and field hero, devised the hypothesis that man's limit in covering 100 meters was 10 seconds.
At the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Owens swept the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints, winning the 100 meters event at the then-record time of 10.2 seconds.

America's Maurice Greene set a record, running the event in 9.79 seconds.
Maurice Greene is Tim Montgomery's teammate in the 400-meter relays, and it is none other than Greene who has become Montgomery's new yardstick.
"Whenever I closed my eyes, I could envision Maurice's eyes looking back at me as he sprinted forward," Montgomery confessed after his coronation.
