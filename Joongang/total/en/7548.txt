The English word "travel" comes from the Latin word trepalium, which means three pits.

Traveling took the form of the modern leisure business that it has become in England in the 1840s.

Thomas Cook, an avid prohibitionist, once transported participants on a train to a large anti-drinking function -- for only a shilling each.

In 1851 he started group tours to the London Trade Exhibition and in 1855 to the Paris Exhibition.
