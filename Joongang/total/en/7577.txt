Saturday marked the second anniversary of the summit meeting between President Kim Dae-jung and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il.

The first thing he announced as we sat down at our tables was the fact that he had earlier in the morning decided that he would stop all propaganda announcements that North Korea had been sending across the Demilitarized Zone.

I remember thinking, "This is a living sign of the tension leaving and the trust building between the two Koreas."
