The stability of the democratic process and the firm conviction of the Korean people to maintain a viable democracy is one of the important reasons Korea has become a top country for foreign investors.

Over the years, one of the interesting things I have learned about Korea is that with the right leader, Koreans can accomplish their national goals.

Voting is one of the most important privileges in a democracy, but unfortunately it is a privilege that is often abused.

Election day, June 13, is a holiday.
