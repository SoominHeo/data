When I visited Panmunjeom last week, I made eye contact with a North Korean soldier outside the window of the T-2 meeting room.
Beyond the shoulders of an ROK military police officer, the North Korean soldier looked straight at me.
And I looked at him in the eyes for the longest second.
From his face, I saw my young self.
He was curious yet scared, and he was determined not to show his feelings.
July 27 marks the 62nd anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement at Panmunjeom.
What have we done for over six decades?
