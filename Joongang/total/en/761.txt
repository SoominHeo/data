In order to obtain the cooperation of a diplomatic mission, a member of the National Assembly must send an official letter to the foreign minister 10 days before departure.

The Korean Embassy in Japan explained that a meeting between the ambassador and a local newspaper had been arranged in April, and the appointment couldn’t be rescheduled, so the embassy called a few lawmakers in advance to seek their understanding, and the ministerial counselor for political affairs instead welcomed the legislators at the airport.

In April 2013, President Park Geun-hye said diplomatic missions should not focus on receiving and attending to the schedules of politicians or other powerful figures.

In 2009, Japan’s ruling coalition clarified that its members would not be received by overseas diplomatic missions when they traveled abroad, nor could they use their authority to receive special treatment.
