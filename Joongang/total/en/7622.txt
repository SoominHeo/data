The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week named seven tax havens that are unwilling to cooperate on improved financial transparency.
They are the classified "laggards," which denied the organization's requests to cooperate in the exchange of legal and tax information to prevent global tax evasion and money laundering.
Those on the list were: Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco, small countries in Europe, Liberia in Africa, and Nauru, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands, island countries in the Pacific Ocean.
If the seven countries refuse to cooperate after one year, the organization is planning intensive sanctions, such as banning its member countries from trading or making financial transactions with them.

In Nauru, there are as many as 400 paper banks whose licenses were approved by the government for a payment of $25,000.
