From the low-energy end (at about 7000 Angstroms) to the high-energy end (at about 4000 Angstroms), the visible spectrum conveys the world to our brains in brilliant hues and shades.
Within the visible light region is the rainbow of colors starting from red and proceeding to violet.
Because of our range of vision, we see a blue sky.
In other words, the color of the sky is blue not because the sky itself is blue, but because of our human-centered interpretation of the world.
We generalize from a special circumstance - the earth on a clear day - and conclude that what we see is a universal phenomenon.
The sky is blue because of the relationships that exist in our world, especially the existence of the atmosphere and our ability to sense the color blue.
Organisms that have existed on the earth largely created the atmosphere, and our vision is a product of evolution that has been going on for 3.5 billion years.
