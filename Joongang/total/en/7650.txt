Seagulls from the North Pole, which migrate the longest distance of all birds, fly more than 20,000 kilometers from the North Pole to the South Pole.

Winter ducks arrived in late autumn and leave here from late February to mid-March for their Siberian breeding grounds.

In Korea, only 57 types of birds are resident year-round, but 283 species of migratory birds visit here.
