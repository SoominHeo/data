Dualism, which says that all things in the universe can be divided into two sides, was largely influenced by Christianity.
Good and evil, brightness and darkness, mind and substance, capitalist and laborer - all these concepts conflict with each other and never move harmoniously.
Thus, dualism is always simple and clear.
It is a black and white theory that denies the existence that something might lie in the middle.
The computer, a beloved child of modern technology, is a technological fruit produced by Western dualism.
A computer only recognizes zero or one, or "on" and "off."
