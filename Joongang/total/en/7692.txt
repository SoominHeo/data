January is truly a cruel month.
More than 830,000 people died in an earthquake in Shaanxi, China, on Jan. 23, 1556, the highest death toll ever from an earthquake.
On that same date in 1909, 5,500 people died from an earthquake in Iran.
Six years later, on Jan. 13, 1915, a temblor in Italy killed 29,980 people, and two years later on Jan. 21, 1917, 15,000 suffered the same fate.
According to global statistics on catastrophes, a disproportionately large number of quakes strike in late January.
As we remember, a quake hit Kobe, Japan on Jan. 17, 1995, killing more than 6,430 people.
Minor earthquakes, with fewer than 1,000 casualties, also have happened in January.
A volcanic eruption in Congo, Africa, last week left 100,000 people missing and an estimated 40 confirmed dead.

Many of the survivors of the earthquake seven years ago in Japan committed suicide because they were unable to overcome their loneliness.

Their motto was that life is short so let's create hope and love for one another.
