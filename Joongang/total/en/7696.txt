Mr. Fuentes, who was two years older than Mr. Hemingway, was a born fisherman.

In Havana he built a mansion that had eight rooms and a swimming pool.

Mary Welsh, Mr. Hemingway's fourth and last wife, recorded that when her drunken husband read aloud from "For Whom the Bell Tolls," his Cuban fishermen friends, many of whom were illiterate, listened in fascination.

In "The Old Man and the Sea," the old man is not able to catch a fish for 84 consecutive days.
