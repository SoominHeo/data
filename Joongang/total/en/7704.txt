The decline of the U.S. economy led to a weak dollar, which lasted for a while after the 1970s.

Then, each country vied with one another by devaluing their currencies to increase exports, and this led to forming economic blocs, one of the reasons for the start of World War II.

The most memorable exchange rate crisis was the Nixon Shock that ended the exchange of the dollar into gold and gold into the dollar, in 1971.

As the yen to dollar rate sharply rose to 130, the Chinese government showed an unpleasant reaction and Korea's foreign exchange authorities seemed concerned.
