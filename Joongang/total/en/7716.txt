The government recently said it will modify the foreign industrial trainee system so that a trainee can be employed for two years after one year of training instead of the current one-year employment after two years of training.

One of the original purposes of the system － teaching foreign workers skills － is completely gone, and the system has been abused as a shortcut to exploit cheap labor.

Over 70 percent of the employers of these illegal immigrants want the government to come up with alternative measures so that they can hire these workers legally.
