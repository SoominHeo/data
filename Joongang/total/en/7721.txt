With the full-scale launching of the euro only 10 days away, currency circulation authorities in Europe are working in a state of emergency.

Germany, after days of agony, decided to use 2.6 billion sheets of deutsche mark banknotes, weighing 2,800 tons, as an alternative fuel in factories because it is environmentally harmless and costs less.

German authorities once considered using the banknotes as fertilizer, but suspended the idea due to the possibility of soil contamination.

Our ancestors inscribed coins issued in 1886 with the romanization "Warn," not "Won."
