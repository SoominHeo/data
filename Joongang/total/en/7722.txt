On Dec. 17, 1903, for just 12 seconds, the Wright brothers made the first machine-powered air flight.
On a mildly cold day in March 1926, the American scientist Robert Goddard scored another first by firing a liquid fueled rocket that rose 13 meters into the air before crashing 2.5 seconds later.
These little moments in history helped to change the world.
They had humble beginnings, but our lives never were the same afterward.
Flying was a childhood dream for man and the development of the rocket rose from the pursuit of space travel.
The Russian scientist Constantin Tsiolkovsky, who opened the rocket age by providing the basic theory that a rocket could fly in space, said at the beginning of the 20th century, "Mankind will not stay forever on mother earth."
Nevertheless, science has brought both welfare and war upon the human race.
The harmless airplane has become a fighter jet and the rocket has been transformed into a high-tech weapon called a missile.
In Afghanistan, American warplanes and missiles have pummeled the enemy to dust.
The beautiful sky that was once the aspiration for dreamers has turned into a bloody battlefield.
