They promised that they would meet again at Mr. Jiang's place on Sept. 9 of the lunar calendar a year later.
Time passed by and the day of promise came.
Mr. Jiang prepared food and waited for Mr.
Fan, but no visitor came until night fell.
Late at night, Mr.
Fan silently stepped into the room with sorrow on his gloomy face.
He was no longer a living person; he was a ghost.
Mr.
Fan lived in poverty and ended up remembering the promise belatedly, only on the appointed day.
Realizing that it was already too late to visit Mr. Jiang by traveling a long distance, he remembered a folk tale that ghosts could travel thousands of miles with one step.
