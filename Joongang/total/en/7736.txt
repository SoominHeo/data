When the album "1," a best-of collection, was released in November last year, it was nearly unstoppable, selling 20 million copies around the world.
"1" reached number one in sales in 34 countries, breaking the record set by the rock band U2 in 1997.
In England, the album topped the charts for nine consecutive weeks, breaking the record set in 1969 by the Beatles themselves with "Abbey Road."
Born in 1943, guitarist and singer-songwriter George Harrison was the youngest member of the Beatles.
Thursday, he passed on, becoming a star in the sky.
For much of his musical career, he stood in the shadows of Paul McCartney and John Lennon, but his passion for music was second to none.
After the third recurrence of cancer, he recorded new tracks in early September.
