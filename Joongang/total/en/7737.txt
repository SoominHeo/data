Many people remember Cho Byeong-gab as one of the most corrupt officials of the Joseon Dynasty.

In the beginning of his administration, Mr. Lee promised the public that all government departments would report all income － even $1 － to the respective authorities, and that the government would make public how the money was used for the benefit of Singapore citizens.

Japan faced such a situation five years ago, but the government succeeded in overcoming the crisis by appointing a stubborn lawyer to head the Resolution and Collection Corp., an agency that collected bailout funds.
