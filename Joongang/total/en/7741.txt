Because she was 16 years old at the time of the shooting, the same age as ChunHyang, the Commission on Youth Protection took issue with a sex scene in the film.
Finally, producers of the film had to cut a large part of the scene to end the controversy.
People were all the more surprised by the fact that, contrary to the general perception of ChunHyang as an adult, the character was only 16 years old.

Different countries have different definitions of the age of majority.
Germany, France and most U.S. states set it at 18, Austria at 19 and Japan at 20.
In Italy adulthood comes at 21.
Korean law uses different definitions of adulthood.

It may be right to do so, considering that even middle-schoolers are often physically larger than their parents.
The plan would have an impact on society as laws are rewritten.


People were all the more surprised by the fact that, contrary to the general perception of ChunHyang as an adult, the character was only 16 years old.

Indeed, Juliet in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" was 15 years old.

In Italy adulthood comes at 21.

But the Youth Protection Law defines adulthood at 19 or older, and thus collides with the practice of selling alcohol and cigarettes to underage university students.
