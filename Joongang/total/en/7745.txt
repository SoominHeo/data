Mr. Churchill was dispatched to the Boer War in 1899 by The Morning Post when he was 25 years old, and he later escaped after being captured by the Boer Army.
Lee In-mo, who was extradited to North Korea a few years ago, was a war correspondent for the North Korean army during the Korean War.
Though I do not dare to call myself a war correspondent, I have reported on wars three times.
