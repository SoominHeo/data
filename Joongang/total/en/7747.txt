Last year, the Grain Distribution Committee, a consultancy of the Ministry of Agriculture, recommended that the government freeze the subsidized rice purchase price or raise it by around 2 percent.
Faced with strong protests by angry farmers, the National Assembly decided in the course of meetings with government officials concerning the legislation to raise the purchase price by 4 percent.

Since the beginning of the Uruguay Round, the government has tried on three occasions to freeze its rice purchase price.

With just three years left before a new round of negotiations on opening up the domestic rice market, local rice prices are six to seven times higher than the international price.
