According to a special law made in 1969, landlords cannot raise the rent as they wish.

Freezing the rent was one of New York Mayor Bill de Blasioâ€™s campaign promises.

This year, all nine positions of the Rent Guidelines Board were filled with de Blasio appointees, making his pledge into a reality.

Apartment developers and landlords are offered tax abatement for 10 to 20 years.
