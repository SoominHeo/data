One of the most comprehensive and harshest criticisms made in Korea's modern history is testimony 

"I dare to say that 90 percent of Korea's current buildings are nothing more than trash."

One imposing edifice that houses a large bookstore was copied because of the strong demand of its owner, who asked the designer to "make it exactly the same" as the one in a photo he took during an overseas trip.

Although it looks imposing, with a big square hole in the upper levels, the horrible edifice is almost as much a plagiarism as the one near Gwanghwamun.
