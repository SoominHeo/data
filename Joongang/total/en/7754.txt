The controversy over whether electromagnetic radiation from microwave ovens, high-voltage power transmission lines and mobile phones can cause cancer or nervous disorders has been going on for more than 10 years.
Reportedly, a law has been enacted that calls for setting standards for protecting people from the potential biological hazards from electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation, which is emitted from nearly all materials around us, may cause serious health defects in the human body.
For example, visible rays of light are a type of microwave radiation, and too much bright light can cause problems.
Strictly speaking, electromagnetic radiation, which has been the topic of a heated debate, is either emissions from microwave ovens and cellular phones or extremely low frequency, or ELF radiation, generated by an alternating current in the frequency range of 60 hertz.
