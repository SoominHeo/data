John Cage, an avant-garde musician from the United States, composed a piano solo with three movements, called 4' 33", in 1952.
In August of the same year, David Tudor, a young pianist, performed the piece for the first time at the Woodstock Festival.
During the playing time of 4 minutes and 33 seconds exactly, Mr. Tudor opened the piano when each movement started and closed it when it ended, but did not touch a key.

However, modern music historians do not hesitate to call 4' 33" the forerunner of things called "happenings."

But when it was discovered, policemen and a medical team were dispatched urgently and isolated 16 employees of the office where the envelope containing the white powder was opened and held them overnight for observation.
