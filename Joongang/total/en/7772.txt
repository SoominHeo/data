China's semiconductor manufacturing technology is estimated to lag behind Korea's by about five years.
This means that the semiconductor industry can serve as a driving force for Korea's economy for only about five more years.


Chinese firms have already attached some strings, such as demanding transfer of Hynix's 0.18 and 0.2 micron micromachining technology as part of its purchase of the plants.

But Hynix is the third largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, and has an upper hand in technology compared with those Japanese and Taiwanese companies.
