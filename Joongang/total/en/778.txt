Park Mi-hyeon, 30, runs a company that recycles waste into fashion items.
When she was still in college, she started making bags and pencil cases with used banners.
She thought those who produce waste should be able to recycle it and came up with the idea of consulting for companies on recycling their waste.
Last year, she helped a cosmetics company recycle plastic bottles from a marathon event it had hosted into blankets.

Park’s company has 10 employees and its revenue is several hundred millions of won.
“It is fun to create works that never existed,” she said.
“And I am also making money.”
