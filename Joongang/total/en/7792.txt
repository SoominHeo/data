Yet, those 10 days were not just an endless tunnel.
The United States sees the light again.
First, there was enormous courage, as great as the tragedy.
Hundreds of firefighters and policemen jumped into the burning buildings.
Survivors burst into tears saying, "We miss them."
That is the power of the uniforms holding up America.
Without the brave passengers that fought against the terrorists in the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, the U.S. Capitol could have been reduced to ashes.
At a recent speech in Congress, U.S. President Bush invited the widow of a hero.
As she stood up, all congressmen rose to applaud her.
That is the power of solidarity reviving the United States Ôºç the power of citizens holding up America.
For the past 10 days, waves of monetary contributions, blood donations, consolation advertisements, the Star-Spangled Banners and voluntary works swept the entire nation; everywhere in the United States, people sang "God Bless America" together.
