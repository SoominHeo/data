The first person Jenner inoculated, on May 1, 1796, was an 8-year old boy named James Philipps.
No details are known about the boy, but he was not Jenner's son.
The story may have had its origin in the fact that Jenner did inoculate his son, Edward, in an earlier experiment using a different technique: scratching the skin of a healthy person with the pus extracted from a smallpox pustule.
The spread of the fictional story in Korea may have been helped by a school textbook during the colonial period.
The ethics textbook, introduced in 1910, contained the unfounded passage about Jenner trying the cowpox virus for the first time on his son.
A later document drawn up in Japan would explain that the authorities back then probably thought the story was a morally edifying tale.
Smallpox was a scourge that threatened the country for a long time and so harshly that it was almost treated like an evil god, even nicknamed mama, an ancient term of address for royalty.
The disease would be rapidly eradicated after a doctor named Ji Seok-young brought in vaccine from Japan in 1879.
