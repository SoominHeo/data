In the 1997 presidential election, the Millennium Democratic Party candidate Kim Dae-jung out dueled the Grand National Party's Lee Hoi-chang by 390,557 votes.
That figure approximates the total number of votes － 408,319 － Mr. Kim held over Mr. Lee in Taejon and the two Chungchong provinces, the stronghold of the ULD leader, Kim Jong-pil.
The United Liberal Democrats no doubt want everyone to remember the math.
The two Kims also had agreed before the election that, in establishing their coalition, to not only split the cabinet between their two parties but also to amend the Constitution before the end of 1999 and move to a parliamentary system.
The ULD － which in effect made the deal on the demand that on top of their receiving 10 cigarettes the cigarette packaging would be changed － probably wants to ask what happened.
