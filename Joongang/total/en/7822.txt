Using his position as British ambassador and bribes, Elgin obtained the permission of the sultan to transport the sculptures to London, which he began doing in 1801.
Over the next 10 years, he shipped 253 marble works to England.


It is said that the robbery of these marble sculptures was not the original intention of Thomas Bruce (1766-1841), better known as Lord Elgin.

Using his position as British ambassador and bribes, Elgin obtained the permission of the sultan to transport the sculptures to London, which he began doing in 1801.

Over the next 10 years, he shipped 253 marble works to England.

When Elgin's dream of a Greek-style mansion deflated after his wife left him for another man, he sold all his loot to the British government for the scrap value of 35,000 pounds.

And Korea, despite negotiations with France for eight years, has not yet managed to get back the looted Choson Dynasty Oekyujanggak library books from France.
