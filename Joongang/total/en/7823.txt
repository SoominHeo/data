In a closed system, the most energetic 20 percent of molecules possess 46 percent of the total energy, while the lowest 20 percent possess 4 percent of the total energy.
The proportion is better than in human society, where the upper 20 percent own 80 percent of the total wealth in the world, but the molecular world still seems unequal.
