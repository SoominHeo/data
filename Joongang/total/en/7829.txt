Since April, we have seen Mr. Koizumi's exquisite strategy for negotiating a visit to the shrine under some circumstances, despite the stir he raised by proposing it.
As if offering an unreasonably low price when buying something and yielding in price little by little, Mr. Koizumi ended up with a bargain price, even though it was a bit more than his first offer.
Mr. Koizumi promised to visit the Yasukuni Shrine on Aug. 15 if he won the April election for leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party.
When he made that statement, the nub of the problem was the visit to the shrine itself, not the date.
As he continued to persist in his plans for the visit, the heart of the problem was subtly changed to the date of the visit.
Komeito, an opposition party that protested against the visit by the prime minister, yielded, on the condition that the visit not be on Aug. 15.
