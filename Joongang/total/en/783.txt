In 2011, a minister nonchalantly said, “It’s strange that you worked for an English paper with no overseas experience.”
He made it look like the most unnatural thing.
When a publisher specializing in foreign policy and security asked me for a translation, the editor said, “You know your credibility is undermined because you only studied in Korea.”
Seven years ago, I interviewed Kang and remembered the scars and burns on his arm, which he proudly called battle scars proving his time in the kitchen.


I’ve learned English only in Korea but worked for an English-language paper for eight years.

I remember my first day working for an English newspaper.

Now, I’ve been reporting in Korea for eight years, but the shadow of “native” stays on.
