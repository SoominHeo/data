The Transportation Ministry said its Wednesday decision was based on airline policy drawn up in 1999.
The policy provides for a 6 to 4 ratio as an adequate breakdown for Korean Air and Asiana flight operations.


The latest controversy arose from the allocation of new routes and flights by the Ministry of Construction and Transportation that gave all 21 new weekly flights between Seoul and Tokyo to Asiana.

The ministry said there had been a large discrepancy on the Tokyo route in favor of Korean Air, which operated 28 flights a week compared with just five by Asiana.

A flight to Europe or North America takes well over 10 hours but a round trip ticket can be had for just over 1 million won.
