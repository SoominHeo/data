The "Central America" sank in a hurricane 200 miles off North Carolina in 1857, carrying 21 tons of Californian gold.
In 1989, 132 years after it sank, an engineer called Tommy Thomson, using a robot able to operate in deep sea, recovered 1.3 trillion won ($1 billion) of treasure that had been lost 2,400 meters below the surface.

At this stressful time, such stories must sound wonderful and far-off indeed to people's ears.
Unfortunately, stories, such as the young man who won his own treasure trove of 2.5 billion won in the lottery on Tuesday, though just as much a long shot, could be building false hopes in the hearts of some.
As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, "Take advantage of the treasure in your own arms before you start searching for treasure in the middle of mountains."

In 1989, 132 years after it sank, an engineer called Tommy Thomson, using a robot able to operate in deep sea, recovered 1.3 trillion won ($1 billion) of treasure that had been lost 2,400 meters below the surface.

Unbelievably, this treasure could be worth up to 10 trillion won.
