In 184, when the scholar Zhang Jue incited an insurrection by his followers, the Yellow Scarves, the emperor relied on counsel from his subordinates to quell the unrest.
A court counselor called Lui Tao stood up and said peace would return only when the kingdom was ridden of the corrupted eunuchs.
One of the eunuchs, Zhao Zhong, countered by saying that Liu Tao was trying to oust the emperor.
