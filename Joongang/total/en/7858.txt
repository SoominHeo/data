In Washington, it is said that the three Republican lawmakers who invited Mr. Hwang are reviewing the possibility of a formal protest if the South Korean government bars Mr. Hwang from making the trip to the United States.

The three Republicans, Representative Henry Hyde, Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Christopher Cox, have not formally asked for Seoul's help, despite inviting the most prominent defector from North Korea.

When Mr. Hwang protested this last December, the government told him, "If you think so, then leave your safehouse."
