So attached to this idea is the provincial government that it is reportedly considering paying the North $1 million for the privilege.

To promote reconciliation and cooperation between North and South, South Chungchong province's plan to simultaneously light torches at the three mountains and combine the flames is actually a good idea.

Not many people would be happy with a local government negotiating to pay $1 million for a mere torch-lighting.

Chungchong province's $1 million payout is nonsense, and so is sending used farming equipment and medicines to the North with help from the private sector.
