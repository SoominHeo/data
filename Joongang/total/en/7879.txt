In the second act of Mozart's opera "Don Giovanni," Giovanni sings, "Serenade for Elvira," to his lover in front of her house.

The fourth song of Franz Schubert's book of songs, Swan Song or Schwanengesang, is a famous example of a serenade.

On the first anniversary of the talks between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il, Kim Dae-jung sang a serenade asking Kim Jong-il to visit South Korea in return for the South Korea's leader's visit to the North last year.

If the president does not stop serenading, perhaps it is because he believes in an old saying, "Ten tries can accomplish anything."
