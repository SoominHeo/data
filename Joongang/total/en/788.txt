Both of my parents were born in 1945, when Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation.
They were born in Hwanghae Province and came to the South during the 1950-53 Korean War.
My father’s family had an orchard, and they fled to Gunsan, North Jeolla, because of rumors that landowners would be persecuted.
My mother’s family escaped to nearby Baeknyeong Island, thinking they could temporarily flee the war.
However, neither ever returned.
Both of my parents only have an elementary school education.
My mother was the oldest of eight children and had to care for her younger siblings.

My parents had three children.

But my mother had extremely difficult deliveries, and the two children they bore on the island became ill. She needed a cesarean section but missed the timing to come to the hospital on the mainland.

Still, they believe the war, which broke out when they were 6 years old, had a tremendous impact on their lives.
