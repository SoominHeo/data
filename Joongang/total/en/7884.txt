Development was taking place everywhere; Chongqing, 2,000 kilometers from Shanghai along the Yangtze River, and Chengdu, in Sichuan province, at the center of the western region development plan, were filled with the din of construction.
In areas of the cities located along the Yangtze River, modern industrial facilities are springing up, and the largest dam in the world is being constructed on the Yangtze.
The dam will not only prevent floods, but will generate 84 billion kilowatts of hydroelectric power a year, and will enable ships capable of carrying 5,000 metric tons to sail into Chongqing, far inland, saving a massive amount on logistics costs.
If this dam is completed, it will literally change the map of western China.
China is emerging as a manufacturing center, where 300 of the world's top 500 multinational companies are operating.
