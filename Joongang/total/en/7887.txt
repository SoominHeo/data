I still vividly remember an incident that took place 13 years ago.

I watched Korean players take the gold medal on the first day of the competition, and it was past 2 a.m. by the time I had finished my news articles after the award ceremony and press conference.

About 12,600 volunteers are needed to run the games, carry out administrative duties, provide foreign language services, medical care and transportation for players and soccer fans.
