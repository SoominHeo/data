The government released the statement after holding an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the issue after three North Korean commercial ships trespassed in South Korean waters.

By making this announcement, the government has confused the right of innocent passage through the Cheju Strait recognized by international law with violation of the Northern Limit Line and infiltration of South Korean waters, which were once a zone of hostility.

We do understand the South Korean government's determination to keep the situation calm, given that it has been trying its best to reopen talks with the North which have been stalled since March.
