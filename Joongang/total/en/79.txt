The leaders of the Group of 20, which make up 85 percent of the worldâ€™s total gross domestic product, met in Hangzhou, China, for a summit that ran from Sunday to Monday.
After the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it was the event in China that received the highest number of foreign leaders.
While China has hosted two APEC summit meetings in the past, they are not comparable in size or prestige to the G-20.

The meeting in the casual vacation spot allowed the two leaders to have sincere conversations.

More than 5,000 journalists from around the world covered the event, and the city was emptied out to make the summit trouble-free.

On Facebook, one Western reporter wrote that there were no people or cars in the streets of Hangzhou, and while the lights on the buildings were splendid, the lights inside apartments were off.
