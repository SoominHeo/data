Silvio Berlusconi, an Italian media magnate, earlier this week won his country's general election, becoming Italy's 59th prime minister since the end of World War II.
This will be his second stint as prime minister in seven years.
Mr. Berlusconi rose to be Italy's richest businessman, beginning with a construction business and expanding into media, retail and professional soccer businesses.
His fortune is estimated at around $12 billion, ranking him 14th richest in the world according to Forbes magazine.
His empire ranges from three television broadcasting stations and the popular Panorama magazine to the daily Il Giornale and Italy's largest publisher, Mondadori.


The brilliant American movie director, Orson Welles, directed and played the role of the protagonist of the movie at the tender age of 25.

Charles Kane was loosely modeled after a real-life American media mogul, William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951).
