The recent elections for the United Nation's International Human Rights Commission and International Narcotics Control Board has become a huge embarrassment for the United States Ôºç in particular, being voted off the human rights commission, on which it had sat since 1947.
Adding to the embarrassment is that nations notorious for their human rights abuses, such as Sudan, Togo and Pakistan won seats in the commission.
Because of the losses, the United States has lost some of its diplomatic clout in human rights issues.
People have attributed the U.S. reelection failure to "arrogant" American diplomacy.
"The 'common sense' notion that the United States is a special country and so deserving of a seat in the United Nations is no longer common sense," said one European diplomat.

Bill Clinton promised to pay $1 billion in installments at the end of his tenure.
The United States tended toward two kinds of reactions to its failure to be re-elected: first, to regret that it has overlooked the UN in the past and second, to an urge to punish the UN for embarrassing it.


"The 'common sense' notion that the United States is a special country and so deserving of a seat in the United Nations is no longer common sense," said one European diplomat.

The United States is the biggest contributor to UN finances at 22 percent, but the country also has the biggest arrears.
