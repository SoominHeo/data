This, in a nutshell, is why people fear that a second economic crisis is lying in ambush ahead.
To solve past problems, we have to either liquidate or rehabilitate insolvent companies.
Resources have to move from inefficient to efficient sectors.
But it is not easy to sell huge pieces of manufacturing equipment; labor reform can not be done painlessly.
Our ability to reform depends on how efficiently and democratically we can do those things.
We don't have a good record of dealing with ailing companies with huge debts, even though many people have demanded it for the last three years.
