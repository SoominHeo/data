Dr. James Flynn, a political scientist in New Zealand said, the average IQ score of Americans rises 3 points every 10 years after he analyzed IQ test results of U.S. Army applicants.
There were similar results when researchers studied the scores on IQ test in 14 countries in 1987.
In Belgium, Netherlands and Israel, in one generation, or 30 years, the average IQ score rose 20 points.
