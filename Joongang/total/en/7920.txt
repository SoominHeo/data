According to a survey of 571 pedophiles in the United States, each was found out to have attempted 300 sexual assaults on minors.
In the United States, after Megan's Law was enacted, which mandated the release of information on sex offenders who committed predatory acts against minors, the "two-strikes and out" system was passed by the House of Representatives.


It was reported that the Commission of Youth Protection screened 300 sex offenders, deciding to publicize the personal information of 170 of them.

This information will also be posted on bulletin boards in central and local government offices for one month and on the Commission of Youth Protection's Internet Web site.
