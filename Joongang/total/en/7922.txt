On June 30, 1908, a large fireball flew over the forest in the Tunguska region of Siberia.
It exploded at a point eight kilometers above the ground.

The most famous is a crater 195 kilometers wide found on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, formed when a comet with a 12-kilometer diameter crashed into the Earth about 65 million years ago.
The changed weather caused by the resulting blaze and dust resulted in the extinction of 70 percent of life on Earth, including dinosaurs.
According to scientists, there are about 2,100 "time bombs" with diameters over 1 kilometer traveling close to the Earth's orbit.

The fire caused by the explosion reduced 2,000 square kilometers of the surrounding area to ash.
