In this calculation, the second probability is reduced by wearing seat belts and using air bags.
Yet their use may prompt the first probability to go up.
According to a survey conducted in the United States, when safety designs improved, more accidents occurred although the rate of fatalities decreased, therefore canceling out the difference.
In fact, slightly more pedestrians and cyclists died in accidents involving cars after the seat belt law was enforced.
An economics professor at the University of California pushed the theory of risk homeostasis to the extreme.
He suggested placing a sharp spike on the steering wheel rather than an air bag, causing drivers to die immediately in collisions.
The professor argued that such a measure would clearly reduce the number of traffic accidents.
Korea's drivers also testify to the validity of risk homeostasis.
On Korea's highways, 54 percent of passenger car drivers wear seat belts, as do 41 percent of bus drivers.


Experts argue that if 90 percent of drivers wore seat belts, the number of traffic accident fatalities would drop 20 percent.

Yet, will encouraging broader adoption of these help Korea step down from the shameful first place in the fatality list?

In this calculation, the second probability is reduced by wearing seat belts and using air bags.
