Recently, the controversial debate has been set alight again after the U.S.'s CBS television network aired its now infamous "60 Minutes" news program on euthanasia in November 1998.
The program showed Dr. Jack Kevorkian － nicknamed "Doctor Death" － administering a lethal injection to a man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.
Mr. Kevorkian, who assisted the deaths of 130 terminally ill patients, was found guilty of second-degree murder and is currently in jail.

The new Dutch law makes the Netherlands the first nation in the world openly to allow euthanasia.
