A premier under Ren Zong, the fourth emperor of Song Dynasty of China, searched throughout the country for people to recommend for government posts.

One day, the premier was having a dinner with senior government officials, and food was stuck on his beard.

The lawmaker commented that although the nation is currently in great chaos, the opposition party president would become the "king" by December next year, resolving all the national hardships.
