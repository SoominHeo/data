Yet every year the United States accounts for 48 percent of greenhouse emissions by industrialized countries, and it should take responsibility for the consequences.
Scientists proposed various alternatives to resolve the problems.
Some suggest covering part of the sea's surface with white Styrofoam to reflect the sun's heat.
Others propose painting all building roofs white.
Another idea is to block sunlight by making a gigantic artificial satellite umbrella.
In order to cancel out the greenhouse effect when the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere doubles, the umbrella would have to cover at least 2 percent of the earth's surface.


That will push temperatures up 1.3 to 4 degrees centigrade, and sea levels will rise 15 to 95 centimeters, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
