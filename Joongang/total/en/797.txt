First unified in 1861, Italy’s history as one country goes back just 154 years.
From the medieval period, each region or city was an independent state.
Many historic towns and villages called borghi still remain today.
Some were established during the reign of the Roman Empire, but most were formed in the Middle Ages.
Those who love the beauty of borghi have formed I Borghi piu belli d’Italia, the “Most Beautiful Villages in Italy.”
The association was inspired by France’s “Most Beautiful Villages of France.”
Similar associations were set up in Wallonia, Belgium, in 1994; in Quebec, Canada, in 1998; in Italy in 2001; and in Japan in 2005.
Villages and towns that conserve historic beauty began to garner cultural attention and economic support.
Other associations of beautiful villages are established as “Le Plus Beaux Villages De La Terre” in Saxony in Germany, and in Romania, Spain and Korea.
In order to be recognized as a beautiful site, it should meet four criteria: preservation of the original village layout, architectural harmony, inhabitation of local residents and value as a cultural asset.
Italy has the highest number of historic towns in the world - 217 of them as of 2015.
