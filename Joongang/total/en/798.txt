If they accumulate 35 hours, they can have one week of paid holidays.
They can take time off in the slow season.
Head of the plant, Josef Kersher, said that when a slow economy calls for reduced production, the plant can adjust working hours to keep the staff employed while cutting down on costs.
There are also exchanges among plants.
BMW has four plants in Dingolfing, Munich, Landshut and Regensburg, and they send workers to one another as necessary.
Hanyang University’s automotive engineering professor Sunwoo Myung-ho said that the automobile industry has large fixed costs from facility investment and that it is hard to keep competitiveness without the German style of labor flexibility.
But this is unthinkable for Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and other Korean automobile companies.
Their labor unions reject flexible working hours and the exchange system.
Moreover, Hyundai Motor’s union claims that domestic and overseas production should be determined through an agreement between the union and the management.
Productivity is bound to be undermined as a result.
It takes 27.8 hours for Korean companies to make one car, nearly twice the 14.8 hours of the United States and the 15.7 hours of the Czech Republic.


The head of the production process team said the company’s principle is to give special treatment to meisters, who are mostly in their 40s and 50s.

Basic pay has more than 10 levels depending on skills.
