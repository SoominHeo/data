The other was a 47-year-old Japanese man, Shiro Sekine.
All three died.


The Chinese character jen is made up of two foundational, or etymological, meanings, a person and the number two.

In the Analects of Confucius, the records of lessons taught by the ancient Chinese philosopher, the word jen is used 106 times.

In one chapter of the Analects Confucius says that a man of strong will or virtue never damages jen to survive, but strives to save jen by sacrificing his own life.
