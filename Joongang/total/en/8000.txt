Judges as defined in our society today made their first appearance after the "Kabo" political reform in 1894 concerning the law on court organization, promulgated on March 25, 1895 ?
the first promulgation of laws in the Chosun Dynasty.
The word "prosecutor" was introduced in this law on court organization, showing the influence of the Japanese law system.
Until then, the administration and jurisdiction were not independent of each other in the government of the Chosun era.
If we were forced to draw a comparison with the court system in the modern era, the most powerful judge during the Chosun era was the king.
Under his power to make final decisions, the central government had various judicial institutions and agencies.
In each region nationwide, provincial governors and chief magistrates exercised judicial power.
The law on court organization in 1895 stated that judges, prosecutors, clerks and sergeants are employees of a courthouse.
