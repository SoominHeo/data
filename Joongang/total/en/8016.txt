The Sumerian civilization belongs to the period of the Mesopotamian civilization, which is the oldest among the four major human civilizations.
The Sumerian civilization dates back to the 32nd century B.C.
Sumerians had then already started using characters, and exchanged receipts and contracts written on clay plates.
Symbolic characters, engraved on the clay plates became hieroglyphs and then cuneiform characters.
Around the 26th century B.C., Sumerians even produced literary works by writing lines on the plates.
The Code of Sumer is the earliest written law and was the origin of the Code of Hammurabi.
Experts explained that Sumerians loved to use a method of depaysement in their sculptures.
"Depaysement" is a term used for a practice of removing an object from its natural position and rearranging it in an unexpected location where the characteristics of the object do not belong.
They explained that Sumerians creatively transformed the shape of the human body in their sculptures using that principle.
Sumerian sculptures had an enormous impact on modern Western sculptures.
Japanese sculptor Shimizu Takashi, who was the teacher of Mr. Kwon, was once a student of master artist Antoine Bourdelle.
