Honore de Balzac, a master of realism in 19th century French literary circles, provides an example of the unfortunate consequences frivolous writing can have on a writer.

At one point, he wrote a book on how to avoid crooks and how to fend off creditors without paying money.

He wrote that the remnants of Balzac's past were akin to the scent of cheap perfume picked up from the brothel of literature Balzac once visited regularly.

Mr. Zeweig criticized that it was the result of abusing one's talent, ability and identity as a writer during his formative period when a writer should hone his own literary style.
