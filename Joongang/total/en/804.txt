Her children go to a Japanese school in the city, and she received a letter from the school in late April that said: "Last week, a student was absent because of the flu.
When students take school busses, please make sure they wear masks.”
It was based on a manual that states all students are required to wear a mask on school buses when there is a flu patient.
Twenty days later, parents got another letter stating that the school is now flu-free, and students do not need to wear masks any more.
Just as some Japanese manuals are considered excessive, the “urgent MERS alert” text message sent by the Ministry of Public Safety and Security surprised me.
I was amazed by the fact that the “emergency” message was sent 17 days after patients were diagnosed and that the content was hardly “urgent.”
