Realizing the futility of fighting against the general's 13,000 troops with less than 100 bodyguards at his disposal, Oda committed suicide by disembowelment.
The movie inside the movie plays with the truth and has Oda asking his aide Tokukawa to remain at Honmo Temple to die in his stead.
The distortion of fact reflects the nostalgia felt by the Japanese people regarding Oda, who died at the age of 49.


Japanese director Iwai Shunji screened his film "April Story" in Korea not long ago.

The historical fact is that Oda was attacked by his most trusted general, Akech Mitsuhide, at the Honmo Temple in Kyoto on June 2, 1582.
