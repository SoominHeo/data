Honore de Balzac, the French in 19th century writer, used to sleep during the early evening and worked on his pieces while other people were sleeping.
His working hours were from midnight to eight in the morning, the time when no one would disturb him, including debt collectors who were on his trail for his entire life.


Including Jean-Paul Sartre, the 1964 Nobel literature winner who refused to accept the prize, and Mr. Gao, 13 French writers have won the Novel Prize in Literature to date.

The pinnacle of his 20 years of work was the saga, "Les Thibault" (The World of the Thibaults).
