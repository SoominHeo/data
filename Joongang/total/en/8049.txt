Male circumcision was introduced in Korea after liberation in 1945 when the country was exposed to American culture.
The United States military influenced Korea in many respects, and their presence on the peninsula advanced circumcision in Korea.
Despite the medical view in the West that retention of the foreskin on the male sexual organ was safe, Koreans believed the foreskin impaired sexual performance.
Doctors insisted that only a small number of men with foreskins, about one in 100, would suffer some type of dysfunction.
An accepted practice today, most men with foreskins are said to enjoy problem-free sexual relations.
In the Bible, the Book of Genesis recounts how Abraham, along with male members of his family were circumcised.
Mummified remains unearthed in Egypt － some dating back 6,000 years － indicate that male circumcision has a long history.
