Choe believes that a new economic philosophy is needed in this new era, and recently published a 5-volume work of historical fiction entitled, "Business Morality,"  spanning the life of Mr. Lim based on the historic data and Mr. Choe's creative interpretation.

Starting with one of Mr. Lim's most remembered quotes － "Riches should be distributed as equally as running water flows, while men should behave as righteous as a scale" － Mr. Choe embarks on a journey into the past in order to help us understand what lies ahead in terms of economic possibilities.
