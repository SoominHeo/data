Mr. Miller, ever the cynic, then willed to three of his acquaintances, who happened to hate each other with a passion, his luxury villa in Jamaica, on the condition that the three use the villa together.
They did so, and, as might be expected, argued for the rest of their lives.
Perhaps the most astonishing part of the will was the clause which would give a large inheritance to any women who bore the most babies in Toronto for 10 years from the date of his death.


The death of Charles Miller, a wealthy Canadian lawyer who died at the age of 73 in 1928, is a case in point.

First, he left his stock in a horse racecourse to a judge and a missionary, both of whom opposed gambling.

(After receiving their windfall, the two made an abrupt about-face and became advocates of the "sport.")
