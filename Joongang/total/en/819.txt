Each year, 3,000 people give up their Korean citizenship to avoid serving in the military.
In 2013, among the children of 15 high-ranking officials in the current Park Geun-hye administration - which includes Blue House secretaries - 16 gave up their Korean citizenship and were therefore exempted from service.


When Yoo first came in to the spotlight, he was described as a “beautiful young man.”

Three months before joining the military, he left the country for a performance in Japan and went to the United States to obtain U.S. citizenship.

Thirteen years have passed since then and Korea is still skeptical.
