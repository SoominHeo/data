  In the report, AMCHAM stated, ＂The Korean government promised to improve the negative perception towards imported cars when it signed a memorandum of understanding with Washington in 1998, but failed to keep its promise.＂ It also demanded government-level support, including President Kim Dae-jung＇s appearance at a motor show for imported automobiles to be held in Seoul in May.
  Commenting on the recent controversy over rising national debt, AMCHAM President Paul McGonagle said, ＂Foreign businesses are not greatly worried about Korea＇s national debt.＂ He noted that Korea cannot be compared with Japan, which suffers from huge financial deficits, and Korea＇s national debt remains at 53 percent even based on OECD standards.
