BOK governor Chon said at a press conference after the meeting, ＂International oil prices are currently the greatest variable in making monetary and credit policy decisions.＂ He also warned that if oil prices continue to remain high for the next two or three months, not only Korea but also the entire world could experience stagflation.
Governor Chon added, ＂The BOK has analyzed that $20-24 per barrel is the highest oil price Korea can support.＂ He went on to say that high international crude oil prices are not causing consumer price increases for the moment, nor creating heavy fundamental inflationary pressures.
