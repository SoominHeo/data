This is one of the changes in the Rason Special Economic Zone, where Chinese, Russian, Singaporean and U.S. businesses are operating.

I will make money 10, 20 years in the future,” said Zhang.

On May 7, South and North Korea tentatively agreed to hold the 15th anniversary celebration for the June 15 joint declaration in Seoul.
