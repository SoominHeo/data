Thirty percent of IASA graduates participate in this program, compared to 2 percent of graduates of other high schools.
In Korea, seven high schools, including science high schools, are designated for gifted and talented teenagers.


IASA’s first step in screening students is a psychological evaluation of applicants’ areas of interest and how they spend their leisure time.

Since most students get low scores, the first step is not a major criterion for admission.

The school considers the third stage the most important.
