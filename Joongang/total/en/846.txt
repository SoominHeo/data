April 20 is designated the Day of People with Disabilities in Korea, which reminded me of the frequent contact I had with people with disabilities as I was growing up.

I remember I used to push him in his wheelchair when I was 16.

Until 1950, however, people with disabilities were not accepted as equal members of society.
