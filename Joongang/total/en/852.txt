Earlier this year, I visited the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York.

The blood-stained shoe worn by a survivor and the fire suit used by one first responder in the rescue operation were just some of the articles displayed.

But for those suffering from the shock of abruptly losing a loved one, there is no point in saying that they should return to their routine.
