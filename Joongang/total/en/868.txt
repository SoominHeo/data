On April 24, 2004, a referendum was held the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus, which was divided into the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus.
Citizens were asked whether the two communities should be reunited and become a confederation.
It was called the Annan Plan, as it was proposed by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The Ghanaian diplomat showed a special interest in reunifying Cyprus since he became the secretary general in 1997.

And the turnout in the South was greater.
The referendum for a unified federation of Cyprus was rejected with 33.3 percent saying yes and 66.7 percent saying no.
This beetle-shaped island nation still remains divided.

Their reasons were the financial burden, social confusion and repulsion towards the North Korean system.
When high school students today grow up and the Annan Plan is applied in the Korean Peninsula, no one can be sure of the outcome.
