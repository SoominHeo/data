Starbucks was in one corner, and a spacious section where people can drink coffee and read was next to it.
I asked a staff member where the library was, and he said that I was already in it.
The walls of the first floor and the bookcases on the second floor are filled with 200,000 books, according to the city library’s classification system.

The library, which used to close at 5 p.m., is now open till 9 p.m. to allow people to stop by after work.
It is open all year round, so locals come during holidays.


The small town with a population of 50,000 is known for its hot springs and 3,000-year-old cedar trees.

As I was walking towards it, I spotted a small, two-story building crowded with people.

The first floor of the public library with its high ceilings is a bookstore with sophisticated furniture and interior items.

The walls of the first floor and the bookcases on the second floor are filled with 200,000 books, according to the city library’s classification system.

It used to be operated by the city, but since April 2013, the private company Tsutaya has taken over its management.
