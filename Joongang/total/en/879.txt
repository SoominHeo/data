More than 5,000 were killed.
This was when popular singer Kim Chu-ja’s song “Sergeant Kim Returned from Vietnam” became a hit.
While the United States paid for the expenses to maintain Korean forces in Vietnam and the assistance after the war helped the Korean economy, the Korean army made a significant sacrifice.
But there is a very different view on the Vietnam War and Korea’s role.
At a think tank seminar in Washington last August, Dennis Blair, former director of National Intelligence, suggested that the Korean forces were more ruthless than the U.S. forces or other armies.
The topic of the seminar was that history issues are hindering the progress of Northeast Asia, and during the lecture, Blair pointed out that Korea, China and Japan all have painful parts in their pasts.
Of course, Blair did not hide the United States’ shameful past, such as its enslavement of Africans and racial discrimination.
At another seminar in January, he, again, mentioned the ruthlessness of the Korean forces while discussing the Vietnam War.


He mentioned that Korea sent the second-largest number of troops into the Vietnam War after U.S.

More than 5,000 were killed.
