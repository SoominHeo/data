If it had stuck to the rule, it wouldn’t have had to assume 333 times the initial loss.
Because of that misjudgment, JR East will have to print centennial cards for the next two years.
The next commemorative occasion will be Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s statement on Aug. 15 on the 70th anniversary of Emperor Hirohitos radio broadcast announcing Japan’s surrender in World War II.
Abe announced on Feb. 19 that he was launching a committee of 16 civilians under a grand title, “The Advisory Panel on the History of the 20th Century and on Japan’s Role and the World Order in the 21st Century.”
It sounded like the advisory panel would have an important role.

In other words, the content of the statement is already in the mind of Abe.
Another news story gave me a headache.
When Abe visits the United States in late April, he will issue a “joint statement” with Washington apologizing for the attack on Pearl Harbor.

If it had stuck to the rule, it wouldn’t have had to assume 333 times the initial loss.
