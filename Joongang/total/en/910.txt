Interestingly, he was only buried there for about two years.
It was the designated burial place for the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England.
But the royalists did not approve of it because he was the only leader in English history to execute a king.
Upon his death, the monarchy was restored and his body was exhumed and posthumously executed.
His mutilated body parts were buried separately.
But Oliver Cromwell was an outstanding figure in British history, and a plaque was put up to mark his burial 200 years later.


One of the people buried there is Jane Austen.

At the time Jane Austen died in 1817, all of her works had been published anonymously because of gender prejudice.

Oliver Cromwell, one of the most controversial figures in the United Kingdom, is a good example.
