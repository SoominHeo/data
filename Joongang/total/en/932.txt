The Japanese government has been practically condoning their hate rallies since they began in 2012.
Tokyo did not take action even when the United Nations urged it to do so.
So I thought the Japanese government was about to make a belated attempt to tackle the issue.
Five months had passed and I saw an article on the Sankei Shimbun titled “No Tolerance for Hate Speech.”
It was about hate speech measures by the Justice Ministry, which it gave high marks.
The government was distributing a poster with the  slogan “No tolerance for hate speech” and had also launched online advertisements.
Of course, this is better than nothing.
But it is simply absurd if the discussion of hate speech regulations have concluded with some posters and advertisements.
According to the Japanese Justice Ministry’s website, “The Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice mentioned appropriate application of existing laws at the Diet.”
In essence, Japan has no intentions to legislate new laws to regulate hate speech.
In November, a group of bipartisan opposition lawmakers proposed a bill to define hate speech as an unlawful act, but it was blocked by the gigantic ruling party led by Prime Minister Abe.


In August, I was on a debate show to discuss the tensions between Korea and Japan.
