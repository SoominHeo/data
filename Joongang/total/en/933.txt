In 1865, the British Parliament passed the Red Flag Act when steam-powered locomotive accidents increased.
In addition to the driver and the engineman, the locomotive was required to have a man with a red flag walking in front to indicate that the vehicle was moving, and a maximum speed of 2 miles per hour in a city was imposed.
The law was enforced for 30 years, and the British automobile industry lost its competitiveness.


This year, drones were given their own section for the first time in CES history and booths were crowded with people amazed by the test flights of the unmanned aerial vehicles.

There are four ministries that regulate drones, but no agency is directly in charge of certifying them.
