I had chickenpox when I was in elementary school, so the virus stayed inactive in my body for nearly 40 years.
I was impressed by its patience.
One of the medical staff members sent to Sierra Leone in West Africa is quarantined in Germany now.

He said that the virus could have come from North Korea, as it could travel hundreds of kilometers in the wind.
It was a plausible theory since the outbreak coincided with the season of the northern wind.
If the virus could travel with the wind, North Korea’s food-and-mouth disease outbreak may have originated from China or Mongolia.
It is impossible to fundamentally control the virus without cooperation among countries in the region.
Viruses have been tormenting mankind just as much as wars, famine and bacteria.
The Spanish flu, the pandemic that spread around the world in 1918 and 1919, killed more than 25 million people.
It is estimated that 140,000 Koreans died from the disease.
Koreans call it the “Flu in the Year of the Horse.”


One of the medical staff members sent to Sierra Leone in West Africa is quarantined in Germany now.

It will take as long as 21 days to confirm whether the medical worker has contracted the virus.

The virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease only lives in animals with two hoofs, and it is especially worrying because it is airborne.

During the outbreak four years ago, I visited the National Veterinarian Institute of Denmark to meet Prof. Graham Belsham, an internationally renowned scholar.
