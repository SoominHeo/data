The “grave” remark became an issue when the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties made contrary moves on Jan. 1.
Senior members of the ruling and opposition parties began the new year by paying a visit to the Seoul National Cemetery.
Saenuri Party Chairman Kim Moo-sung visited the graves of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee, as well as the late Kim Dae-jung, where he said he would “embrace all parts of Korea’s turbulent history.”
Meanwhile, Moon Hee-sang, interim chairman for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, visited the grave of former President Kim Dae-jung and left.
When reporters asked him what he thought about Kim Moo-sung’s visit to Kim Dae-jung’s grave, he responded: “It is praiseworthy.
But I don’t have the courage yet.
When I leave my party position, I’d like to personally visit Park Chung Hee’s grave.
I wonder what it looks like.”
The evaluation of Korea’s former presidents is left to the future generations.
But it’s regrettable that the opposition leader refrains from visiting Park Chung Hee’s grave because of his politics, despite his personal intentions.
Some claim the 2012 presidential election was decided when opposition candidate Moon Jae-in skipped visits to the graves of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee, only paying respects at the grave of Kim Dae-jung.


In 1998, conservative journalist Cho Gab-je’s book “Spit on My Grave,” a biography of former President Park Chung Hee, started what became known as the “grave controversy.”

The controversy returned for the 18th presidential campaign.
