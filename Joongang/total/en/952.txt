The 89-year-old wife constantly says, “Beautiful!” She is impressed 
She also likes to say, “Poor thing.”
She pities a stray dog and adopts him.
When her husband passes away, she says with tears, “My poor love.”
She is not the kind of person to say cliched things like, “You left me all alone.”
The documentary shows that the essence of love is not the object of affection, but the attitude of the person in love.
We often say that we can’t find someone to love, or that someone is not worth loving.
But true love comes from the mind-set to care and love one another, or from the attitude of love itself.
And love begins from having sympathy and feelings for all the things in the world.
Director Jin Mo-young said, “The couple has been caring for each other as a habit for 76 years.


I’ll have been married for 20 years next year, and 80 years is too long a time to even fathom.
