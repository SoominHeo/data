Politicians are extremely divided, and the president always assumes the role of a third party in every controversy.
She acts like a judge, not a person involved, criticizing and evaluating.
She has been criticized for not taking responsibility.
It is unclear what the ruling party has been doing.
It has long lost its function.
When the social leaders are so shaken, the lives of average people are full of struggles and suffering.
The economy has also been aggravated.
But the politicians havenâ€™t conducted any bipartisan cooperation or collaboration.
They continue to fight and criticize.
The truth needs to be clarified, and accountability should be found.
But when we need to work together, we need to cooperate.
Only then, we can get out of these hard days.
The collaboration of the wild dog and the jackals inspired me to search for a grand reconciliation.
The year 2014 is almost over, and only regrets and pity remain.

A female lycaon was traveling on her own, when she found four baby jackals hidden in a hole.

Politicians are extremely divided, and the president always assumes the role of a third party in every controversy.
