American consulting firm McKinsey and Company thinks innovation through commercialization is the key to Alibaba’s success.
The company took technologies developed in other countries and successfully commercialized them for Chinese consumers.

It is directly related to Korean companies’ operations in China.
Samsung has been pushed aside by Xiaomi, which pursues the same kind of innovation as Alibaba.
Xiaomi founder Lei Jun has imitated Steve Jobs since the company was established in 2010.
