The reform plan includes trimming  payments, putting newly hired public servants in the national pension, extending the contribution period from 33 years to 40 years and raising the eligibility age to 65 from 60.

I’m talking about a bill proposed six years ago, not the one suggested by Grand National Party members last month.

In Germany, 21 percent of the income is contributed for the pension.

They acknowledged the necessity of reforming the public servants’ pension six years ago, so they must know the situation is worse now.
