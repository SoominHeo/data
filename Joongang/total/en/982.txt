More than 5 million people visited and the breathtaking sight was overwhelming, even for a foreigner like me.
I asked a friend who lived in the United Kingdom for a long time, “Is this year specially commemorated as it is the centennial of World War I?” He unenthusiastically said, “This is how we commemorate, and quite a few more events have been planned this year.”
Right after World War I, a body of an unknown soldier was buried in Westminster Abbey.
The inscription on the plaque reads, “They buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.”
A nation needs  something that binds citizens together.
History is a shared experience that lives on.
In the United Kingdom, two World Wars have left sacrifice and dedication.
Even today, young children visit the memorial and write, “I will not forget, from your great grandson.”
During World War I, one in 10 British men in the most active age groups was killed.


This year, artificial ceramic poppies were placed in the Tower of London’s moat from early July to Nov. 11, Remembrance Day.

More than 5 million people visited and the breathtaking sight was overwhelming, even for a foreigner like me.
