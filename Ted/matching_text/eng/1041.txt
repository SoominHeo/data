Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October.

There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get.

And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most. 

Right now, if you want to test water in the field, you need a trained technician, expensive equipment like this, and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.

And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still need to drink water.

I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.

It's in its early stages, but this is what it looks like right now.

We call it the Water Canary.

And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light.

This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. 

We're also, on top of that, integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM.

What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time.

And then, instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most, it can happen automatically.

We've seen how distributed networks, big data and information can transform society.

I think it's time for us to apply them to water. 

Thank you.
