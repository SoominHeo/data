I study how the brain processes information.

What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see?

Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns? 

And then the last thing I wanted to say, really, is to emphasize that the idea generalizes.

I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really, really important, and if we can understand the code, the language of the brain, things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before.
