If your life were a book and you were the author, how would you want your story to go?

With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere.

And yes, I can change my toenail polish.

It was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive — a new kidney from my dad — that allowed me to follow my dreams again.

Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs, I had no idea what to expect.

But if you ask me today, if I would ever want to change my situation, I would have to say no.

Because my legs haven't disabled me, if anything they've enabled me.
