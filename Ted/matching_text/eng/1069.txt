Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

I would love to share with you a story. 

Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.

Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.

But it was a little bit boring.

Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.

But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.

(Music) His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.

This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.

History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else?

(Music) For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.

(Cheering) They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning. 

Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.

There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. 

And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.

(Laughter) Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.

For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.

One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.

(Laughter) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. 

And this was a cause for celebration.

The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.

And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty. 

And they remembered a man, one amazing German, every time a new storytelling device popped up next.
