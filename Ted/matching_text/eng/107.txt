As a conceptual artist, I'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations.

I do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance.

But regardless of the format, two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue. 

In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit.

But a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery.

In America, we don't like to talk about slavery, nor do we look at it as a global industry.

But by using this Buddhist symbol, I hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black America and encourage discussions about our shared past. 

To create "Lotus," we carved over 6,000 figures.

I've been collecting wooden African figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the world.

Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots.

But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger than just US history.

While showing in Berlin last year, a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings.

I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard from the early 1900s and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years.

But it's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society. 

I hope my artwork creates a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation. 

Thank you.
