I want to talk to you about something kind of big.

(Laughter) A chunk of rock six miles across, moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet, slammed into the Earth.

It released its energy all at once, and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing.

If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War, lumped them together and blew them up at the same time, that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment.

The dinosaurs had a really bad day.

Okay? 

Okay? 

Okay? 

Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.

We all live here in Boulder.

We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left.

It hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.

You can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. 

It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.

Now, not all asteroids are that big.

Some of them are smaller.

Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in.

It broke up through atmospheric pressure, it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage.

So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.

The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here.

This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope, or something like that out in the desert, but it probably would not have caused global devastation. 

It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage.

(Laughter) It was 1908.

(Laughter) It was 1908.

(Laughter) It was 1908.

The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles, okay?

This did a huge amount of damage.

And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. 

In Meteor Crater it was made of metal, and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground.

Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage.

They're not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did.

They're just not big enough.

They don't have to do global devastation.

If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic.

But if it came over a city, an important city -- not that any city is more important than others, but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. 

So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ... (Laughter) what can we do about this?

This is a potential threat.

Well, what do we do about them?

The first thing we have to do is find them.

This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.

It's right here.

But you can see that it's extremely faint.

This is a rock that was about 30 yards across, so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago. 

These things are faint.

They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.

We have to find these things first.

The National Science Foundation, other countries are very interested in doing this.

If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis, because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. 

And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.

I don't think Apophis is a problem.

This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now.

It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.

And it turns out, we've even done it.

In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.

We did move the comet a little tiny bit, not very much, but that wasn't the point.

However, think about this.

That means we can do it again. 

If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, and it's headed right for us, and we have two years to go, boom!

You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing, you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it.

(Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 

(Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 

(Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 

And this is the part, it's the part I just love.

(Laughter) After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM!

(Laughter) After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM!

(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts, like I said, engineers.

Instead you get near it. 

(Laughter) But we'd be rich!

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So think about this, right?

It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand, incredibly light, but it can run for months and years, providing that very gentle push.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote, and so we can change our future.

(Laughter) We have the ability to change our future.

65 million years from now, we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.
