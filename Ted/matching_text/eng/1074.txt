I'd like to share a couple with you today.

My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was.

My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber, which is â (Laughter) â which is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole.

A lot of people ask me, how did I make these?

A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also.

But what if you want to make an app?

First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc.

And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone software development kit, and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app.

Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app.

This is so I can share my experiences with others.

A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads?

So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like.

When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to, all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations.

I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.

First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.
