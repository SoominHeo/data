So magic is a very introverted field.

While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.

That's true even amongst peers.

But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research? 

Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.

Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

So let's give this a try.

And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
