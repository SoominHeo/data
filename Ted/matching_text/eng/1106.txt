And so we try to ask: What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in, not fighting to stay out?

And we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance where work and learning are integrated.

You work by learning, and you learn by working.

And the design we came up with had the following characteristics. 

And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them -- but we found that the young people loved it.

And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it, not just with big businesses, but small businesses all over the country. 

And it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very, very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal, things like working in teams, doing practical projects, and putting them right at the heart of learning, rather than on the edges. 

Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn.

Other ones have a focus on health care, tourism, engineering and other fields. 

It doesn't animate them.

They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour.

Thank you very much.
