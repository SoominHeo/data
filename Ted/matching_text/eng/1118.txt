Before we do that, I want to kind of put biology in its place.

And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.

I love to do synthetic biology.

I love things that are alive.

I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.

But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution.

So this raises three really important questions: What is life?

Is biology special?

Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable?

about the origin of life and the meaning of life?

When? 

CA: And when do you think that will happen? 

LC: Hopefully within the next two years.
