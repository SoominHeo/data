Are there universal laws?

Is Edinburgh a horse?

Is Microsoft a great big anthill?

What do we learn from that?

We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on -- is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit, or is there serious substance to it?

So is that just another version of this?

What is the reason for this?
