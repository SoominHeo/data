I was three months pregnant with twins when my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram. 

I was 35 years old at the time, and I knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect.

So, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects, and we felt reasonably prepared. 

Well, nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.

The doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas, had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.

And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.

But I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long that I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

While there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life to have some kind of positive impact. 

So I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.

She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, the Washington Regional Transplant Community.

But they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.

On March 23, 2010, the twins were born, and they were both born alive.

What are the researchers learning?

And was it even worthwhile to donate? 

And I came up with an idea.

Next, she explained to me how rare it was.

She had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the National Disease Research Interchange.

She got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria, and it was Thomas's. 

She also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.

This shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.

It's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be. 

She said she saved it because she doesn't know when she might get more.

So in closing, I have two simple messages today.

And they need him in order to do their job.

And a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.

And I only hope that my life can be as relevant.
