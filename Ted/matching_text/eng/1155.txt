My name is Joshua Walters.

I'm a performer. 

But as far as being a performer, I'm also diagnosed bipolar.

Maybe you thought that was scary, but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. 

(Laughter) There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time.

They're just practicing.

One day they'll get here.

I can feel your noise.

The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode, and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs, where I was sleeping through high school.

The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.

When I got out I had a choice.

I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. 

Now if you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.

You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible. 

Some of them committed suicide.

So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. 

Now recently, there's been development in this field.

And there was an article written in the New York Times, September 2010, that stated: "Just Manic Enough."

(Laughter) Your call.

And everyone's somewhere in the middle.

Everyone's somewhere in the middle. 

But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel.

Maybe no one's really crazy.

Everyone is just a little bit mad.

How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum.

How much depends on how lucky you are. 

Thank you.
