And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.

You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.

I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.

And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.

You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. 

That's a painting of a circle.

A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.

It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.

My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.

She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.

And I had to get out of town.

Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.

And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.

And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. 

The epiphany is that death is a part of life.

She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.

And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.

It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.

Thank you.
