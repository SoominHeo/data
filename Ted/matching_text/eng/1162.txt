As an artist, connection is very important to me.

Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.

I was in awe.

My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.

The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year. 

Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.

Each iceberg has its own individual personality.

But the reality is far from it.

As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.

As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. 

I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.

And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old. 

The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.

That's about a 15-foot boat.

And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.

You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.

This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.

And this video is real time. 

And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. 

Thank you.
