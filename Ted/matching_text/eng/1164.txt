This artist is Gus Weinmueller, and he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."

And what he does is -- (Laughter) he spends a week at a time with a family.

And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep, with a toothbrush and pajamas, and he's ready to spend the week with them.

And whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property.

He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently. 

So they came up with "dig jigs."

So what happens is you dance on the grave, and after you've done your dance, everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.
