From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him.

He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years.

On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.

Remarkably -- no, miraculously -- he lived.

And that's actually where our story begins.

Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together -- first physically, then emotionally, and then spiritually -- he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. 

Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail.

But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time.

And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing.

And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. 

It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. 

Thank you.
