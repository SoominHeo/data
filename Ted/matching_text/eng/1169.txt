This story is about taking imagination seriously.

Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.

I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture.

In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven. 

The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't.

But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.

I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.

I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently -- a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials. 

My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.

It's a self-portrait titled "Wide Hips."

(Laughter) We hoisted them on poles to photograph.

I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.

I was mesmerized.

I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers.

Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid.

He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city.

So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.

We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds.

But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.

I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel.

He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement. 

So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them.

There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.

So we had to create one.

Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.

It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation. 

This intersection had been bland and anonymous.

Now it had a sense of place.

I walked underneath it for the first time.

As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky.

My life was not going to be the same.

I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.

I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. 

So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.

This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.

Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings.

My artistic horizons continue to grow. 

I'll leave you with this story.

I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.

There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
