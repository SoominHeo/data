We didn't even have a telephone.

The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers.

And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm.

And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. 

And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.

It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear.

It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear.

There are only 200 of these bears left.

They're more rare than the panda bear. 

I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one.

I thought, my career's over.

I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic.

What in the heck was I thinking?

Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it.

Please enjoy. 

And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.

Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years.

And what does that mean?

After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news.

You glaze over with it.

And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this.

And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on.

Polar bears are amazing hunters.

This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores.

There was no ice around.

But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it.

And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb.

And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. 

We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic.

When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears.

And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place.

These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. 

They're not going to die of hypothermia.

They're going to get to land.

These ringed seals, these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.

These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear.

And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here.

They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice.

And here's a picture of sick ice.

This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old.

And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. 

And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea.

The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place.

I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive.

But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner.

In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms.

Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. 

Here's me in my office.

I hope you appreciate yours.

This is after an hour under the ice.

I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet.

And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water.

And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over.

Which means, "Take my camera."

And he thinks I'm saying, "Take my picture."

So we had this little communication breakdown.

(Laughter) But it's worth it. 

(Laughter) But it's worth it. 

This is a bowhead whale.

This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution.

It could have survived 150 years of whaling.

Alright, my favorite part.

When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other.

Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation.

They've got that wryly smile on their mouth.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

It doesn't work that way.

They're also big.

They're not these little harbor seals.

They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.

And they're also curiously aggressive.

You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon.

All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon.

It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.

So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal.

And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat.

And we're trying to not fall in the water.

I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water.

And this was the first thing she did.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So that's all I had to work with at that point.

But I just started to shoot these pictures.

So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed.

She went off, she got a penguin.

She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.

And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin.

Why else would she release these penguins at me?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This didn't work.

And so that didn't work.

This went on for four days.

This just didn't happen a couple of times.

And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins.

(Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face.

She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve.

But yet she didn't stop.

She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. 

And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.

And I thought, she's about to bite.

She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me.

What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display.

She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with.

And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment.
