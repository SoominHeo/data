So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.

It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.

It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. 

Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.

And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.

And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.

(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. 

Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.

This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.

Zoom into it and see where it was taken.

And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.

So you can open this one. 

MM: It starts playing immediately.

Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.

But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.

This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.

But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.

We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. 

And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.

And it works the exact same way.

You can pinch into any page.

Open it up. 

Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.

What is the business here?

Is this something that other people can do? 

MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.

CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
