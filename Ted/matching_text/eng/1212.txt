I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.

But you have to have the right tools.

If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.

And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands.

And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes.

But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.

And this is nothing new.

It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.

But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.

And that sugar dough?

Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.

So what does that mean?

And so I want to do a little demo for you.

But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit.

If I separate them again, I have some light.

Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.

It's like a wall to the electricity.

In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.

I plug in again the power to it.

And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.

I can start plugging in lots of lights.

And we can start talking about things like electrical load.

It'll dim.

We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.

You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. 

So this is all in your home kitchen.

And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.

We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii.
