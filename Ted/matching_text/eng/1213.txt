I wanted to be a rock star.

I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.

To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.

This was in the late '80s.

And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.

They wouldn't have me.

I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.

And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.

And I was certain that's what my life would be. 

And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest.

And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing.

They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart.

In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.

The most transformative experience I've ever had -- in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision.

And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself.

And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out. 

I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life.

I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.

And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.

And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.

And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. 

Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this."

And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called "Sleep."

Here's me singing "Sleep."

Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.

Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure.

Such an intimate video. 

(Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers.

And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."

And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 

Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting.

And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be.

There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions.

And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.

I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.

Here's our winner of the soprano solo.

This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.

(Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like, "No problem, everything's fine."

And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.

This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

(Applause) 

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you so much. 

And I had the same reaction you did.

I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.

I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.

And the video went viral.

We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it.

And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, "All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"

And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.

And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions.

This time we got some more mature members.

(Singing) And some younger members. 

(Singing) And some younger members. 

(Singing) And some younger members. 

(Singing) And some younger members. 

(Singing) And some younger members. 

(Singing) And some younger members. 

Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 

Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts.

EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.

Thank you.

Thank you.

(Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. 

And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it.

And I've just chosen a few of them here.

So two things struck me deeply about this.

The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other.

It doesn't matter the technology.

And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.

It wasn't a virtual choir.

There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.

But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.

I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family. 

What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.

This will be a premiere today.

We're not finished with the video yet.

And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.

You're the very first people to see this.

This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 

Thank you.

Thank you.

(Applause) Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
