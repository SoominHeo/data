As a boy, I loved cars.

When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.

Like this.

And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.

Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 

And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.

So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.

We built the hardware and the software.

We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.

Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 

It's the perfect driving mechanism.

In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.

Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.

(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. 

Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?

You could regain this time.

Thank you.
