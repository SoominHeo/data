Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. 

I remember my first fire.

But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.

When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.

Well, I was next.

So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went -- up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. 

(Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door.

A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.

The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. 

And you know what I've learned?

They all matter.

Thank you. 

Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. 

Mark Bezos: Thank you.
