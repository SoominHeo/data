I will not dance to your war drum.

I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.

I will not dance to that beating.

I know that beat.

It is lifeless.

I know intimately that skin you are hitting.

It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched.

I will not dance to your drummed-up war.

I will not pop, spin, break for you.

I will not hate for you or even hate you.

I will not kill for you.

Especially I will not die for you.

I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.

Everyone can be wrong.

Life is a right, not collateral or casual.

I will not forget where I come from.

I will craft my own drum.

Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing.

Our humming will be drumming.

I will not be played.

I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.

I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.

This heartbeat is louder than death.

Your war drum ain't louder than this breath.

I've been wrong a lot lately.

Like a lot.

So I couldn't figure out what to read today.

I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.

So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now.

But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here.

Are you holding her? 

This is "Break Clustered."

All holy history banned.

Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.

But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence.

Whose son shall it be?

Which male child will perish a new day?

Our boys' deaths galvanize.

We cherish corpses.

We mourn women, complicated.

Bitches get beat daily.

Profits made, prophets ignored.

War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.

I live cycles of light and darkness.

Rhythm is half silence.

I see now, I never was one and not the other.

Human contracted itself blind, malignant.

I never was pure.

Girl spoiled before ripened.

Language can't math me.

I experience exponentially.

Everything is everything.

One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.

One woman loses six.

One woman straps herself.

One woman gives birth to a baby.

One woman gives birth to borders.

One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.

One woman never did.

Where do refugee hearts go?

Faced with absence.

We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all.

My spine curves spiral.

Precipice running to and running from human beings.

Cluster bombs left behind.

De facto landmines.

Do not fear what has blown up.

If you must, fear the unexploded. 

Thank you.
