I was afraid of womanhood.

In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear.

Let me explain.

There were plenty of role models all around us.

We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be.

Now my mother was different.

Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.

Humor relies on the traditions of a society.

It takes what we know, and it twists it.

Now what if you put together women and humor?

I think you can get change.

Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table. 

Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos.

My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.

But I found my place.

Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning.

Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman.

My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties.

And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances.

But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. 

Thank you.
