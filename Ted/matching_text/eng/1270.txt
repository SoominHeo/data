Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me.

But the thing is, how come it's news to most people?

Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote.

Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the "highlighter version," which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes. 

Now I did have an advantage.

(Laughter) So I read slowly.

(Laughter) So I read slowly.

(Laughter) I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" -- (Laughter) -- because it turned out to be three months.

I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. 

The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels.

God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -- jealously insisting on no other gods.

The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert.

And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.

It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.

"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says, "and others are ambiguous."

Only God knows the true meaning.

Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: Houris.

Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight.

(Laughter) And that number 72 never appears.

There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.

That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.

Paradise is quite the opposite.

It's not virginity; it's fecundity.

Thank you.
