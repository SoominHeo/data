My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.

And my little idea that will do that is sleep. 

This is a room of type-A women.

And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.

We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally. 

So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.

So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.
