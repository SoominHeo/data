Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 

(Applause) 

I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.

(Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it.

Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms.

And I'm going to demonstrate for you.

(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you.

And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 

Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.

And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs.

So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody.

And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.

And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves.

That's what it feels like to me.

It's not pleasant.

I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.

That's the thing.

Thanks.

You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research.

(Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called "Weather Systems."

♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ 

Thanks. 

(Applause)
