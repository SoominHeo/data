But this is no news, right?

You've read about it already. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) Any computer designers in the room?

That makes a good cartoon.

But what are you going to do with a flat track pad, those square things?

That's true.

And the Internet has reached every corner of the world, the poorest, the remotest places.

Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.

So we are bridging the digital divide.

It has empowered you, it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

You know, these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi.

And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam.

So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And technology has even changed our relationship to God. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now I shouldn't get into this.

I mean -- I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.

They were used first by a Danish newspaper, which wanted to make a point on Islam.

We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.

History tells us, they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews.

And here we are now.

So the clash of civilizations is here, and cartoons are at the middle of it?

This got me thinking.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This looks like a giant hamburger.

You don't want to be the ham in the middle.

I was there to report on that story in cartoons.

So you see the style is different.

This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.

I went to places like Gaza during the war in 2009.

So this is really journalism in cartoons.

You'll hear more and more about it.

This is the future of journalism, I think. 

And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.

Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.

There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa.

And I went to see the Dozo.

The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters of West Africa.

They are believed to have magical powers.

They can disappear and escape bullets.

(Laughter) "Another time."

(Laughter) "Another time."

(Laughter) "Another time."

(Laughter) "Another time."

And what can a cartoonist do?

Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right?

So the idea was pretty simple.

We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast.

We took them away from their newspaper for three days.

Show the positive power of cartoons.

It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good.

And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen.

And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues.

And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.

The first day, they were even shouting at each other.

But they came up with a book, looking back at 13 years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. 

So the idea was there.

And I've been doing projects like this, in 2009 in Lebanon, this year in Kenya, back in January.

In Lebanon, it was not a book.

And it worked.

So this was a great project.

And then in Kenya, what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity, which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.

He has to keep his job.

Well I believe that in any context anywhere, he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred.

And that's the message I try to convey to them.

I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing.

Today, tech companies are the world's largest editors.

They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see.

And for dictators all over the world, the good news is when cartoonists, journalists and activists shut up. 

Thank you.
