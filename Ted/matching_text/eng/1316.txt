Imagine, if you will -- a gift.

I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.

It will bring all of your family together.

Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.

It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. 

It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith.

You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.

You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.

You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.

And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing.

You'll eat countless gourmet meals.

Flowers will arrive by the truckload.

You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled.

Your life will have new meaning.

By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one.

Does Amazon carry it?

Does it have the Apple logo on it?

Is there a waiting list?

Not likely.

This gift came to me about five months ago.

And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

I'm not sure you'd want it.

But I wouldn't change my experience.
