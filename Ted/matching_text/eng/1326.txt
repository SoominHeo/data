On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.

It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.

So the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?

That's my question.

If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.

The question is: what's next? 

Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.

The first one is mass.

As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.

So, could we use that in mobile phones?

Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.

We shift the gravitational center of it.

For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.

So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.

Now, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape.

We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.

We can play with the shape itself.

It's like tapered to the downside.

If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.

It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands.

It's fairly simple.

Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself.

Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?

Let me show you the living mobile phone.

(Laughter) And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.

You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again.

So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want. 

So, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.

And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.
