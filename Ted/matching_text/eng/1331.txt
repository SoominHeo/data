Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?

Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle. 

So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.

It has three different kinds of strings.

And the third string is pretty innovative.

It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.

It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.

And it's very difficult to tune. 

So without further ado, would you like to hear it? 

CP: Okay.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.

And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
