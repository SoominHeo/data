Let's start with day and night.

And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.

These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. 

So, we have this ability as well.

And in humans, we call it the "body clock."

And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside. 

So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.

And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active. 

So, what would our natural rhythm look like?

What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?

Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.

And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.

And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.

So, cut to the modern day.

We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.

Thank you.
