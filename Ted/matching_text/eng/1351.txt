Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.

Try hitting the boat. 

PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.

Now, to do that, we needed a set up, like a magician's trick.

And what we did was, we needed to give Milo this big problem. 

So as Dimitri starts tidying up, you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. 

PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet.

Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. 

PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you.

And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen, that is a truly wonderful moment.

The cool thing is that we're doing as well: as you interact with him, you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.

His mind is based in a cloud.

That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer.

He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. 

And I love those revolutions, and I love the future that Milo brings. 

Thank you very much indeed.
