Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.

And there's a cause for that, all right.

We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.

As an architect, I have to confront something like this. 

So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses?

Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.

It is the landscape, right? 

They're perfect.

You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs, because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs.

We use a modified inkjet printer, and we print geometry.

So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes.
