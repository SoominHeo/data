I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work, and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden.

This map can be updated, and we can add in new data. 

This is an image from Saturday, photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.

So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.

Thank you.
