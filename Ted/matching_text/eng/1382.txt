The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art. 

Yes, breast cancer.

I thought I knew what fear was.

That day, I learned what fear was. 

I needed something that would pull me out of all this.

But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.

Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.

It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.

Difficult.

I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.

And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind. 

But I needed something else.

Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.

What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.

Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life. 

It's the power of focus.

It's the power of an image.
