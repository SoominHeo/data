I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.

And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do. 

I also knew that I'm not alone.

We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s.

So what was once the special little side treat now is the main, much more regular.

So really, any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.

Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- tucking into a big old steak. 

So why was I stalling?

I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution.

Imagine your last hamburger.

(Laughter) So my common sense, my good intentions, were in conflict with my taste buds.

Sound familiar? 

So I wondered, might there be a third solution?

And I thought about it, and I came up with one.

I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.

It's called weekday veg.

Simple.

If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats.

So you want to swap those out with some good, sustainably harvested fish.

After all, cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake. 

The program has been great, weekday veg.

After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians. 

Thank you.
