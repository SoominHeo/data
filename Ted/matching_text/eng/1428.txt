I suppose I owe you an explanation.

I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music.

"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang, is one of his poems.

So, what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.

Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.

When she was 10 years old in 1927, she published her first book of poems called "The Janitor's Boy."

Here she is.

And here's her poem. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."

It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.

She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England.

He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children.

One was his daughter, Laurence.

And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was: Did she marry?

He converted from his Anglican faith.

He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement, the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as -- and he became a Jesuit priest.

And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."

(Laughter) It's my turn.

I still have two minutes.

(Laughter) Okay, we're going to start that verse again. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) I have so much admiration for him. 

(Laughter) (Clapping) 

It works better, right? 

Let's bring it down.
