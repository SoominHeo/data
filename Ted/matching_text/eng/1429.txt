The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope, and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.

Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.

So, that's 20 micrometers across, that pollen grain there.

Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.

And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. 

Cool pollen, though.

This one I particularly like.

Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across. 

Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.

That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.

And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves.

And this is where it gets interesting for forensics. 

A different pollen signature, if you like, or a different pollen fingerprint.

By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from.

Where has it been?

Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures.

But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from, to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did.

This is a horse chestnut.
