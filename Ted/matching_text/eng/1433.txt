We are drowning in news.

Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year.

That's just one source. 

My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run?

That's the idea behind The Long News.

And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.

And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside. 

Okay, that was kind of cool.

So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future?

Well, let's take science.

Someday, little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things.

That someday is already here if you're a mouse.

We're having trouble feeding six billion today.

Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research. 

What about global politics?

We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.

It seems that with or without us, life will go on. 

Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
