Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.

I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.

He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself.

And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. 

And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost.

And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. 

(Laughter) So, I just started playing.

And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. 

And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.

And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace.

And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level.

He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.

Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality.

And that is an escape from his tormented state.

And I understood that this was the very essence of art.

And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us. 

Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.

So, please forgive me.
