I've been simplifying things for 30 years.

I come out of the advertising and design business.

My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands. 

I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.

And many people might need help in computation.

And what about terms like "over the limit"?

When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk.

Plain English is about changing the content.

And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.

It's a grid, it's a calendar.

All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.

We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English.

They have been tested in the laboratory.

When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.

And the IRS has introduced the program. 

There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention.

There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity.

We see all this complexity.

It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority.

There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate.

There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. 

So, how are we going to change the world?

Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.

I thank you.
