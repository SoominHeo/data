It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year, a business worth almost two billion dollars.

The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses, and this is how we end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals. 

Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. 

In 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds.

And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked.

Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.

And in these places they are cared for.

They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation.

Following this argument, they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized.

However, this would mean having killed 26,267 birds, only in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, only in 2006. 

But, some researchers, myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative.

All of these were released by us.
