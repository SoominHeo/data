That first one, it was more like a passionate affair.

What a fish.

I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months.

One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.

"Absolutely," I said.

For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests.

It's hard to overstate the destruction.

Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish -- they've collapsed.

There's almost nothing left.

So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.

That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna.

Not very sustainable.

It doesn't taste very good either. 

So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.

I wanted to support them.

The day before the event, I called the head of P.R.

Let's call him Don. 

"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."

"Sustainable proteins," he said. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company; no one could give me a straight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head biologist.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

"Don," I said, "what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets.

I said, "Chicken pellets?"

He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed."

"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I fell out of love with this fish.

(Laughter) No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie.

(Laughter) No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This second fish, it's a different kind of love story.

I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain.

A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.

She kind of set us up.

(Laughter) It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering, white color.

The chef had overcooked it.

Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked?

Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.

They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands.

They did it by draining the land.

They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.

And ecologically, it was a disaster.

It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds.

And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. 

What did they do?

They reversed the flow of water.

They literally flipped the switch.

Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in.

The farm's incredible.

I mean, you've never seen anything like this.

You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland. 

(Laughter) Okay?

And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. 

It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.

I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. 

And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. 

It's great, but I was in love.

He pointed at the algae. 

Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.

The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.

The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing.

There is no feed.

Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? 

Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?"

At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change.

"That's success," he said.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) He shook his head, no. 

(Laughter) He shook his head, no. 

(Laughter) He shook his head, no. 

(Laughter) He shook his head, no. 

(Laughter) He shook his head, no. 

They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests.

(Laughter) They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92.

(Laughter) No kidding. 

(Laughter) No kidding. 

(Laughter) No kidding. 

(Laughter) No kidding. 

(Laughter) No kidding. 

He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.

(Laughter) He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.

I almost never cook with it.

Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin.

It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean.

I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.

And then he added, "But our water has no impurities."

And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered.

The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.

(Laughter) (Applause) But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical.

We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers.

Can I be honest?

I don't love that question.

No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world.

One billion people will go hungry today.

One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage.

Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years. 

Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources.

Not by the latest combine and tractor invention, but by fertile land; not by pumps, but by fresh water; not by chainsaws, but by forests; and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea. 

Want to feed the world?

Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?

Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself?

It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat.

Instead, let's look to the ecological model.

That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience. 

And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
