I've had some time to think it over.

Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.

Roundabouts are much better.

But that's just safety.

What about time and gas?

So, unsignalized intersections, meaning stop signs, they save many lives, but there's an excessive proliferation of them.

They're expensive to install, but they are more expensive not to.

But they are not applicable in all situations.

Cars rarely appear on that third road. 

And so, the question is, what does that cost us?

What's that time worth?

Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day.

Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction. 

Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction.

Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again.

The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely.

Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.

Can that be accomplished with existing signs?

So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.

Stop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950.

So, why not use a yield sign?

Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.

So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.

You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember what you used to do at yield signs?

That would not work. 

So, what the world needs now is a new type of sign.

It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.

And uncertainty results in caution.

When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down.
