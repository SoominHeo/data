They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.

I'd never seen anything like that. 

When I was growing up, my heroes were people like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.

I grew up in a musical family.

(Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.

Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.

Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

And dance has progressed.

It is insane what dance is right now.

Dance has never had a better friend than technology. 

And this is happening every day. 

And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.

Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
