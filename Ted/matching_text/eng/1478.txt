And this is all done, by the way, by the International Astronomical Union.

This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects.

This is from their actual book.

These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.

I go to Chrysokeras.

So, I hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers. 

And then of course Arnon to Thoth.

And of course there will be advertisements.

This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.

From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.

The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.

And I think that Djabran Fluctus, that fits that mode.

Also, from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.

Anyone can suggest changing a name.

So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.

We've got to change this stuff up fast.

So, these are actual names of people that work there.

I did some more investigation.

These are more people working for this group.

And, as you can see, they don't use their first names.

(Laughter) These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.

Something is askew here.

(Laughter) Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

(Laughter) Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

But obviously the point is that numbers are maps.

And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?

That is the premise of this particular presentation.

So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet, and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully. 

(Laughter) He was also famous for having no body.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

You see the icosahedron again.

The dodecahedron, it's dual.

The reality, now here is something important.

What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other.

And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other.

So, the whole concept of branes in the universe, if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be.

And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about. 

What a coincidence!

This would be a normal wave pattern.

But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background, is this kind of odd undulation.

It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be. 

And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.

(Laughter) So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.

(Laughter) Better really hurry up.

Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.

Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born.

If Fibonacci had been on Paxil, (Laughter) that would be the Fibonacci series.

Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago.

If numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live, I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering, we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe.

And I tried to build a particle accelerator.

(Laughter) And that didn't work out well.

Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved.

They are the nodes on the string, patterns and relationships, 27, 37.

That was the first chart I came up with. 

You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers, the beauty of the symmetry.

Every top adds up to 37.

Bottom, all 74.

(Laughter) Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.

Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247.
