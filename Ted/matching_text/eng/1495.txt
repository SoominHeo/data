(Laughter) But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face.

And should they ever come in contact ... well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. 

My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.

Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic.

I want to show you two examples.

The first is 4Shbab.

It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel. 

Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.

Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha√Øba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives.

He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.

4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels.

In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.

But it's not about fire and brimstone either.

Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges. 

Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.

And it's called "The 99."

Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.

They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa.

Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. 

Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.

It's now a theme park.

There is an animated series in the works.

And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever they find it. 

"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.

We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.

Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.

I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. 

Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this.

Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern.
