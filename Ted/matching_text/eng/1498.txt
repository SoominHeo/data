One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.

One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.

(Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.

(Applause) I was planning on finishing on a dance ... (Laughter) So, that's going to look pretty shabby now. 

(Laughter) Who will start me with $1,000?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.

300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.

(Laughter) And now it's an idea.

(Laughter) It's great.

(Laughter) "How can your coffee be true?"

(Laughter) And they will say, "Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.

And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."

(Laughter) This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?

(Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together. 

(Laughter) The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit.

(Laughter) "I'm sorry.

(Laughter) "Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, "Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) Asking for your bank details.

And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them.

And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, "There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.

This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system, it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.

(Laughter) And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, "Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days."

(Laughter) Wonderful news.

(Laughter) Wonderful news.

How many people here are left-handed?

You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed.

And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.

And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.

I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?

(Laughter) But, you know, he's gone.

I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States.

But we proved them wrong in Iraq.

(Laughter) "But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who've blown themselves up."

(Laughter) "We're going to find you."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.

(Laughter) But you get the picture.

And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."

And we all want to believe in President Obama.

It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."

And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen.

But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.

We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.

(Laughter) Could you say "avuncular"?

(Laughter) Could you say "avuncular"?

(Laughter) Thank you very much. 

(Laughter) Thank you very much.

(Laughter) Thank you very much. 

(Laughter) Thank you very much. 

(Laughter) "Make this world a better place, if you can.

(Laughter) "So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."
