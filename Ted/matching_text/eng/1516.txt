A few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.

In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. 

In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.

1.1 million of them.

Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home.

They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.

And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away. 

And then the financial collapse happened.

Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.

There is no way back home.

And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.

These are the boom-and-bust refugees. 

Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.

But, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road. 

So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.

And that as we worry about our next job in the office, the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.

Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.
