They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

And I go on the podium.

And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture.

(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.

(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.

Let's look at the first video.

I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.

And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Was that nice?

So that was a sort of a success.

Now, who should we thank for the success?

I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

They don't often even look at the conductor.

You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.

But Viennese audiences do not do that.

You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event. 

Um, he was happy.

And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music.

The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time. 

You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.

And not all conductors do just that.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?

So please, wait for the conductor.

Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.

(Laughter) But ...

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

(Laughter) So, does it work?

And you know what happened to Muti?

(Laughter) "Why?

(Laughter) He's a nice guy.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.

Now, either he is senile, and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Audience: (Claps) 

Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again. 

Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.

Audience: (Claps) (Laughter) 

(Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play.

Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play.

(Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it.

Why are the eyes closed?

There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.

(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

That's what he does.

The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.

And that's what makes them into partners.

This is very exciting for those players.

They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.

(Laughter) It is very tiring.

(Laughter) It is very tiring.

But it's the best music making, like this. 

But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.

Can we have the next video, quickly?

You'll see what happens when there is a mistake. 

(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.

(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.

(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.

(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.

(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.

(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.

(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.

But authority is not enough to make people your partners. 

You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy.

He's conducting Mozart.

(Music) The whole orchestra is playing.

(Music) The whole orchestra is playing.

(Music) Now something else.

(Music) Now something else.

(Music) See?

(Music) See?

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) Look at the eyes.

(Music) Look at the eyes.

(Music) Look at the eyes.

(Music) Look at the eyes.

So that's a good thing.

And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way.

When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?

Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.

So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that.

And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.

So Kleiber is about process.

Kleiber is about conditions in the world. 

But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?

Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.

(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?

(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?

And you're playing a painful sound.

And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.

But not in a way that you want to stop.

(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.

(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music)
