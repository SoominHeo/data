If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.

You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like.

The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"

Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks? 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

(Laughter) (Applause)

But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.

The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.

There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes. 

Before long, there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany.

I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, "Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great.

Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it.

Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.

But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance.

Ataturk was a lateral thinker.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

Which is that, actually, first one, all value is actually relative.

All value is perceived value. 

As an advertising man, I have to admire that. 

These funny signs that flash your speed at you, some of the new ones, on the bottom right, now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face, to act as an emotional trigger.

What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera, but they prevent twice as many accidents.

So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling to conventional, classically trained economists, is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a Â£60 fine and three penalty points. 

Tiny little behavioral economics detail: in Italy, penalty points go backwards.

You start with 12 and they take them away.

Not so in Italy. 

Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry.

It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. 

So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.

(Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic. 

(Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.

If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.

It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies. 

What's also interesting, if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value, a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value: They are often quite egalitarian.

Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.

And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.

It patently veers toward propaganda.

However, what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Nowadays, the user is actually involved.

This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Finally, we have contextual communication.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home, and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you, put 50 dollars into your pension, you would save a lot more.

The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior.

If you did this, more people would save more.

It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes.

(Laughter) But if anybody did want to do that, that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually: fundamental opportunities to change human behavior. 

(Laughter) But if anybody did want to do that, that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually: fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.

Now, I've got an example here from Canada.

Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible, added value, without changing the product in the slightest.

(Laughter) In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies, he came up with this.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I would say it's a work of genius.

But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. 

Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product, which is something very exciting for them.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

Woman: Weren't they square? 

Man #2: [unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end.

Man: Just try both of them.

(Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer?

(Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer?

Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.

So drink your wine blind in the future. 

We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists, and less time agonizing over what else we can do. 

Two quotations to more or less end with.

There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.

So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display, and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life.
