Thank you.

It was a simple machine that changed my life. 

On the stage that day, I was so nervous.

My English lost, I wanted to vomit.

There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.

But well, I'm feeling good right now.

I would like to share that story today.

We have seven children in my family.

All sisters, excepting me.

This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.

Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.

My family ate one meal per day, at night.

Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.

In Malawi, the secondary school, you have to pay school fees.

Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.

I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields.

It was the future I couldn't accept. 

I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education.

Another book put that knowledge in my hands.

It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.

So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.

Another machine pumps water for irrigation. 

(Applause) I could not get rid of them.

(Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED.

Whatever happens, don't give up.
