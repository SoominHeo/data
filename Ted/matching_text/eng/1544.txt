It's not better public transportation.

So that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists, going in the wrong direction. 

So example number one: the Internet itself.

These are three of the founders of the Internet.

You might have had a French club or a Debate club.

And as you can tell, they are basically goof balls.

They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network.

The limitation was that they didn't have any money.

No particular amount of capital to invest, of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight.

They had none of that. 

No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it.

That ethos led to a network architecture, a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since.

So unusual, in fact, that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.

As late as 1992, IBM was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

That's why the mascot of Internet engineering, if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.

Because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly.

(Laughter) It's very complicated, but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual?

It's more like a mosh pit.

No one pays you to do this.

It's just part of your neighborly duty.

Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.

You need a lot of trust, but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."

So the Internet needs addressing and directions.

It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.

Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater, but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us.

So what do we do to figure out who is where?

This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.

In rare but striking instances, a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. 

So, for example, last year, the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.

Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way.

It advertised -- the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet, to declare what you see near you -- it advertised that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube.

"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."

Which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there, and the ISP threw them away unopened because the point was to block it. 

But it didn't stop there.

You see, that announcement went one click out, which got reverberated, one click out.

And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event, you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube.

Then, at moment number two, you have the fake announcement go out.

And within two minutes, it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.

If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube, your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back. 

Now just think about that.

One of the most popular websites in the world, run by the most powerful company in the world, and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it.

And yet, somehow, within about two hours, the problem was fixed.

How did this happen? 

And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers around the world.

So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.

The bad news is there is no fire brigade.

The good news is random people apparate from nowhere, put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.

(Laughter) You know, it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help.

And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it. 

Example number two: Wikipedia.

(Laughter) In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. 

(Laughter) In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. 

(Laughter) In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. 

And then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project. 

And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.

(Laughter) I am not making this up.

(Laughter) I have a theory I can explain later.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And you just bring your problems to the page.

It's reminiscent of the description of history as "one damn thing after another," right? 

Number one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."

Apologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.

I'm not taking sides.

(Laughter) It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. 

(Laughter) It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. 

(Laughter) It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. 

And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.

At all times, Wikipedia is approximately 45 minutes away from utter destruction.

(Laughter) It's this thin geeky line that keeps it going.

Not because it's a job, not because it's a career, but because it's a calling.

It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. 

They even gather together in such groups as the Counter-Vandalism Unit -- "Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" -- to just clean up the pages.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

They're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do.

And Wikipedia has embraced this. 

Totally mortifying to him. 

Now, it being encyclopedic and all, Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.

You could see arguments on both sides.

Here is just a snapshot of some of them.

They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.

It was an act of kindness. 

As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. 

Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.

We see it on blogs all over the place.

They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. 

This is my favorite goofy blog: Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.

(Laughter) You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler.

(Laughter) Yeah, I know.

(Laughter) Yeah, I know.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people.

(Laughter) You're like, "You know?

(Laughter) You're like, "You know?

(Laughter) You're like, "You know?

(Laughter) You're like, "You know?

It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, "Hey, would you mind?"

The person said, "No, that's fine."

I even think it can go into the real world.

We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors -- everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online -- to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says, "You know, I'd rather not."

And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later, this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big, if you don't mind.

And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it. 

In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan.

In fact, talk about technology imitating life imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around. 

An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them, and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination.

It said, "Can you help me get there?"

Released it on the streets of Manhattan.

(Laughter) They'll fund anything these days.

(Laughter) No.

(Laughter) No.

(Laughter) No.

(Laughter) No.

CouchSurfing: one guy's idea to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free, with people who live far away, and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.

It's a brilliant idea.

It's a bee that, yes, flies. 

Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.

And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And when you go on it, if you listen and see carefully and closely enough, what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you.
