So the question is, what is invisible?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.

We can't see into the engine room.

We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.

And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.

In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there.

Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy.

So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.

One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you.

Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.

(Laughter) Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So, one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand.

Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.

It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.

And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. 

For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?

But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.

In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.

But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.

So that's why we don't think it exists, the Sufi masters working on us. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.

I'm an ignostic.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Another thing we can't see is the human genome.

Geneticists will know this, but every year since, it's been revised downwards.

We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

The universe disappears.

The more light there is, the less you can see. 

It's much easier if it's not really there.

You can't see the future, obviously.

And you can't see the past, except in your memory. 

One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see.

But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago.

The question is, who, then, are we?

Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.

Didn't catch on, unfortunately.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light, not to be able to see darkness. 

Electricity, you can't see that.

(Laughter) You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light when you turn the light on.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887, he called them radio waves because they radiated.

Anyway, so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know.

It is incredible how little we know.

Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything."

(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.

(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.

(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.

(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause)
