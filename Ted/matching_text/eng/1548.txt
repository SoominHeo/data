Is the latest tower in London a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool? 

In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.

He triggered the modernist revolution.

After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution, Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."

After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced (Laughter) you could say promiscuity, or at least openness to new ideas with, "I am a whore."

Recently, Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis. 

And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More" is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined, as who or what we are against.

The cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.

Or this idea of the misunderstood genius, frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.

In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process.

His famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work.

As you can see, a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings.

And through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design. 

A very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.

But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.

As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.

And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea.

It doesn't really work in this context.

But for another client in another culture, it could really be the right answer to a different question.

So as a result, we never throw anything out.

We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity.

You never know when you might need it. 

And what I'd like to do now, in an act of warp-speed storytelling, is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world.

And we saw this guy, Haibao.

We even double checked.

And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.

We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions, and went to China.

(Laughter) So the People's Building, as we called it.

This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture. 

And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China.

So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life.

China symbolized by the dragon.

Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.

(Laughter) China has many great poets, 

(Laughter) China has many great poets, 

(Laughter) China has many great poets, 

(Laughter) China has many great poets, 

but we discovered that in the People's Republic public school curriculum, they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng, or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.

So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."

It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture integrated into Chinese culture. 

The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.

The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.

The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.

Bicycles have become forbidden many places. 

Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.

So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?

We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.

So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion, get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions. 

So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.

This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to sail water from Copenhagen to China.

But in fact, the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark, and then they sail empty back.

So quite often you load water for ballast.

So we can actually hitch a ride for free. 

And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath, we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.

The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes.

When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.

You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof, jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo. 

So when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.

And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument, the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.

They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.

So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year, don't come to Copenhagen, because she's going to be in Shanghai.

If you do come to Copenhagen, you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So the second story that I'd like to tell is, actually starts in my own house.

This is my apartment.

And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure.

And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars, why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses, put them on a podium of cars. 

And because Copenhagen is completely flat, if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view, you basically have to do it yourself.

Then we sort of cut up the volume, so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.

(Laughter) And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 

(Laughter) And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 

(Laughter) And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 

(Laughter) And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 

And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.

They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes, we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic, naturally ventilated, rasterized image.

The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.

If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.

So, the Mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.

They can actually have both. 

As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.

You always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen, and the sort of turmoil of the world. 

One last example is that recently we, like last summer, we won the competition to design a Nordic national bank.

This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.

So he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan. 

So we took the commission.

And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.

We quite often make little movies.

We always argue a lot about the soundtrack, but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.

And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape, gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green, lush landscape. 

So, you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature, in this case it's actually creating nature.

And the buildings, they don't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains, they also operate like mountains.

So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem. 

(Applause) Yes, maybe just to round off.

So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.

With a little luck and some more evolution, maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.
