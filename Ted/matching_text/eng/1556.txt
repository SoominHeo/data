I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. 

I'd like to start with a little experiment.

But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.

And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 

The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.

There are just way too few eye care professionals. 

This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.

In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. 

I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.

Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.

In fact, this technology's been evolving.

There are about 30,000 in use now.

And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.

I have a global vision for vision.

And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.

To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.

The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.

This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.

But the cost has to be brought right down.

It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. 

How do you solve this problem?

You start to get into detail.

How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?

How do you deal with the industry?

And the answer to that is research. 

What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.
