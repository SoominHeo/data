My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.

What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things.

My mother told me that, when I was a child, that I should always respect the little things. 

So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."

My world was seen as less.

So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.

I thought, I need to retreat into something else.

So when my mother used to take me to school, she thought I was at school, and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned, and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. 

Now, the one time I was in the shed, and my mother suspected something, thinking I was at school.

My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.

So you'd just see her feet.

And I went into this little fantasy world.

(Laughter) So I did.

And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now I shall show you something here.

And I'll explain.

As you can see, that's a pinhead. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Applause) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it.

So, to cut a long story short, I went home, went underneath the microscope, and I crushed up a piece of glass, crushed it up.

And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass.

Some of them were quite jagged.

So I was crushing up these pieces of glass, which, as you can see, that's the actual frame of the house.

And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.

And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work, at the same time.

(Laughter) (Applause) Because that has happened to me. 

(Laughter) (Applause) Because that has happened to me. 

(Laughter) (Applause) Because that has happened to me. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.

And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.

And as I was doing it, what happened?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Gone.

So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another, into the atmosphere somewhere."

Because it's such a small sculpture, nothing can go wrong.

And I decided to build it up.

And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.

I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things, which sent me insane.

But I managed to do it.

Have we ever heard of a dust mite?

Darren dust mite and his family moved in. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Applause) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.

There's not enough room for the two of them.

So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.

I think he was just warning him actually.

But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.

Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle? 

Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.

And, you know, all different things happen.

But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane, to stop it moving.

And after I've cut out the shape, then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. 

So after I've done the same thing, then I have to paint it.

And after I've actually sculpted them, I have to paint them.

(Laughter) But I would never do it to a living fly.

(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.

(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.

(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.

So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face.

So I have to be very quick.

This one took me approximately, I would say, six to seven weeks.

(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"

(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"

That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture.

I would say it probably measures ... a quarter of a millimeter.

In America they say a period stop.

And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber, which I took out of the air.

When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.

I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.

And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.

And she saw me walking around like this.

And the horse is made from nylon.

And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.

To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult, because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action. 

(Applause) 

The most famous statue in the world.

This one, I would say, was a serious challenge.

(Laughter) Because I had to put the torch on the top.

That one is, more or less, the same type of process.

I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base.

So I wanted to have that little image.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And we all know that is the Hulk.

I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.

Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it.

It's -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.

So most of my work, I don't use glue.

That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.

Constructed each plank of gold.

And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.

The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.

(Applause) 

(Laughter) It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.

The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing.

And that was done with a particle from my shirt.

And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

(Applause)
