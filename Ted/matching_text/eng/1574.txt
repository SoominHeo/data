And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.

And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. 

I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.

It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.

It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street. 

So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.

And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.

Our antibiotics are running out.

And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.

So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.

And I feel now like George Bush.

It's like "mission accomplished."

You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.

And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.

And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.

That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it. 

That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.

And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.

And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.

Why did they not die?

Mission accomplished!
