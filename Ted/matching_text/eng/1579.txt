This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. 

Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted.

Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others.

We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. 

When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools.

It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.

Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. 

Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.

We start from doodles and sketches.

And sometimes we make real plans.

And sometimes we just start building.

Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion.

Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. 

From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. 

All materials are available for use.

Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined.

And the things that they build amaze even themselves.
