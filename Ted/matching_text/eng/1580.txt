And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. 

The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.

And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

It's one of the great products of the human mind.

The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college.

But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means.
