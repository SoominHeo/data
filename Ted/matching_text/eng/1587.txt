I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world.

And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation. 

You probably read something about it in the papers.

And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression.

And so a plan came up to video the vote.

So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.

They were taking videos of buildings shaking.

They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But nine of the 10 in those first hours.

And so the protest kept going.

They had to turn the spigot entirely off.

Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.

They also affect people who want to send messages, 

But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.

Those days are over, never to return.
