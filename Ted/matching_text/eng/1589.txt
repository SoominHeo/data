Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

And I can tell you this happens, because it happened to me. 

Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.

And the only thing that came was creative block.

I couldn't come up with any ideas. 

And I got distracted by it.

And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent, when I should have been talking to my clients. 

And reaching success, I always did what I loved.

But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management.

I bought a fast car.

(Laughter) It didn't help.

I was faster but just as depressed. 

And clients didn't call.

(Laughter) Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself.

So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. 

Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.

But it wasn't a quick trip.

It took seven years. 

But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.

And when I went back to following these eight principles, the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.

I learned that success isn't a one-way street.

It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.

It's a continuous journey.

So here is to your continued success.
