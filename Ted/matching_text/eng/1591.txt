My field, the field of psychology, hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.

So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.

And then three emotions for which there are no English words: fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge; schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune, a malicious pleasure; and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.

It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting.

Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow, when they're absorbed in something out in the world, when they're with other people, when they're active, engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one, learning, having sex, whatever.

There is a profound need to belong. 

But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.

Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy, they care that we replicate, that we pass our genes on.

So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.
