This is a world-changing invention.

The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, worldwide.

But smoke alarms don't prevent fires. 

Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires.

And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.

What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start?

Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. 

So how does electricity ignite residential fires?

Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.

Our invention had to address all of these issues.

So what about circuit breakers?

Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.

And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate.

Now, every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network.

The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug.

If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off, and prevents another fire from starting.

We call this technology EFCI, Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. 

Now, besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings.

Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location, or even a cell phone.

There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone.

The potential energy savings is very, very significant. 

In the spirit of this year's TED Conference, we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.
