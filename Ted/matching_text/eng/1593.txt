What's happening to the climate?

It is unbelievably bad.

So we all look at what we can do.

And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2, 52 percent are tied to buildings.

Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.

So we ran off to a sushi bar.

And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.

And it was something called EcoRock.

And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.

We started R&amp;D in 2006.

But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.

And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.

So then we went forward and built our production line in China.

We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately. 

We did the line install over the summer.

We started right there, with absolutely nothing.

That's the finished production line there.

The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.

These are people who worked this project for two to three years.

And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.

So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.

We must change everything.

We're going as fast as we can.

Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum, you know, CO2 generated.

Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.

Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.
