I was the better at getting and keeping. 

I was the better at grubbing and heaping, 

I was the better at pillaging Troy; 

I was the better at search and destroy. 

You were the better at spinning the plates; 

You were the better at quiet debate. 

I was the better at coke and rum; 

Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza? 

Now we come down to it, relatives grieving. 

Is that you were the better man, in the end; 

I wrote this next poem for my mother.

My mother was certainly the most important in mine.

(Laughter) Bright as a button.

Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher, (Laughter) but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.

(Laughter) I wrote this poem for her.

Never return to the haunts of your youth. 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Never succumb to the gorgon's stare. 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

No-one is waiting and nothing is there. 

Never surrender the future you earned. 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Never return to the bridges you've burned. 

Never retreat to the 'glorious past.'

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Treat every day of your life as your last. 

Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

Keep to the track, to the beaten track; 

No-one is waiting and nothing is there. 

Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.

Ladies, don't do it.

Stop it.

Tell them to go to hell.

You bodies are wonderful as they are.

Just leave them alone. 

Count thy sheep and not thy years. 

None can make a stitch in time. 

Lean against me, calm your fears, 

Count thy blessings, not thy years. 

I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.

America is an empire.

I hope you know that now.

I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.

Let me put this bluntly.

If Americans are so fat, stupid and ignorant, my dear friends from Birmingham, how come they rule the world? 

Which is America's Jupiter? 

What of the titans of media? 

Whose servants enslave us all? 

What of the Brand and the Label? 

And what of the Constitution, 

Whose power the masses extol -- 

Aye, that it does. 

The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. 

Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned 

To lie with a bloody man, his terror unfeigned. 

The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree. 

I battered and scattered the fools from my way. 

Grown sick to our stomachs, and sick of our lives. 

Um, there are -- I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses.

Okay, I was ill.

I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.

So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.

That was in October of 2000. 

I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman, who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.

But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.

(Laughter) Not with much success.

(Laughter) Not with much success.

I love to think what they thought, what it was like. 

All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all! 

You think we didn't do that?

Oh, we did.

We killed every single one of them.

Inch by inch we killed them.

Our natures haven't changed a single iota.

And they never will.

Even when we've got off this little planet, and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets. 

And I am as bad as you.

I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.

And at seven o'clock every night, I took me some more girls, already corrupted.

I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.

And I took crack cocaine, every single night for seven years.

It was like Dante's "Inferno."

It was unbelievable.

One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours.

And you stay up for 12.

It was absolutely unbelievable.

Twenty-two godchildren I've got.

What do I say to them?

I only stopped because I thought if I got caught, what would happen to my mother.

If you're a woman, remember that.

The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does. 

Pale she was, listless; 

We hoarded and sold her -- 

Came word out of Babel, the lady returns! 

Many there were, to covet her kiss.
