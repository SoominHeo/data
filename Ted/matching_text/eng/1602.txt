And it was found close to here, Stanford.

Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves.

(Laughter) Exact equivalent. 

So what happened when the professor left the room?

As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow.

Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.

Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.

(Laughter) Couldn't do it.

Self-discipline: the most important factor for success.

15 years later, 14 or 15 years later, follow-up study.

What did they find?

They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.

They had good relationships with the teachers, students.

They were doing fine. 

A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow, they were in trouble.

They did not make it to university.

A few were still there with bad grades.

A few had good grades. 

And let me show you what happened. 

So what happened in Colombia?

(Laughter) In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.

(Laughter) She should not go into banking, for example, or work at a cash register.

But she will be successful. 

So this has applications in all walks of life. 

They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.

Thank you so much.
