Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation.

And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me. 

FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada. 

YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there. 

FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.

FN: And I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia -- also the U.S. and Japan. 

YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.

We had a lot that got us excited.

FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful. 

FN: Can you bring out our baby?

(Applause) This baby is fully electric.

It goes 150 miles an hour.

It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.

Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.

It's got an amazing user experience.

YB: Thank you.
