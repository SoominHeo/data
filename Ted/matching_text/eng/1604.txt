And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported.

While they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.

And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. 

So we are very encouraged by these results.

Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course, is an entirely different matter.

But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can. 

Thank you.
