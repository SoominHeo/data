Bear in mind this was an ultrasound, so it would have been moving images. 

Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system.

There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.

And she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated.

They stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.

So I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant.

And I said, "So, could you do it right here?"

And if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode, the precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.

Now in one of these brain-dead people, if you trigger the right spot, you will see something every now and then.

Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs.

And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.

He told his doctor, who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title, "Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."

Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives.

Masters and Johnson: now we're moving forward to the 1950s.

They didn't buy it.

You may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"

British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators.

He said, "If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made."

Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory.

So now you have an evolutionary excuse.

In Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her, you will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate, which is the number of piglets produced.

So they came up with this five-point stimulation plan for the sows.

There is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD.

This did not stop Masters and Johnson.

They developed an artificial coition machine.

This is basically a penis camera on a motor.

There is a phallus, clear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source, attached to a motor that is kind of going like this.

Doctor Kinsey had heard -- and there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s -- that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility.

Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
