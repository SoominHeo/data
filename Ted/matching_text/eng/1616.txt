Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.

Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second.

It's nothing if not ambitious. 

This is the machine below Geneva.

On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.

And this picture was taken by ATLAS.

It caused immense celebration in the control room.

I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.

It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. 

Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power.

In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect.

So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.

We had to take them out, which we did.

We reconditioned them all, fixed them.

They're all on their way back underground now.

By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.

I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
