Most of them are pretty basic. 

Number two: hesitation is bad.

This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows, in the Yosemite high country.

Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.

You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.

The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock.

And then from that point on, you're basically falling.

Rule number three: have a plan.

This is a climb called the Naked Edge, in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.

This climber is on the last pitch of it.

He's actually right about where I fell.

There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.

And all the hard pitches are actually below him.

You have to plan ahead to get to the top. 

But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete.

This is a climb called the Dike Route, on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.

So you've got to focus.

You don't want to stop in the middle like Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.

You've got to keep going. 

This is a climb in the Needles, again in California. 

With this, typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing.

Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.
