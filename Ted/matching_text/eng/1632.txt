And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

(Laughter) I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

(Laughter) I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 

And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality, you could only build on it. 

And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality.

It's all about contradiction, which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.

75 percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada.

(Laughter) "Don't use big words."

(Laughter) "Don't use big words."

(Laughter) "Don't use big words."

(Laughter) "Learn the lingua franca."

(Laughter) "Learn the lingua franca."

(Laughter) "Learn the lingua franca."

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math.

And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) That's why little girls don't do math.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Of course, by talking about science I also may, as I did the other night, incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me.

One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument.

But I don't engage in serious arguments.

The head is good, body bad.

Head is ego, body id.

And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo," "I ain't got no body."

That's how you get rationality.

And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head.

That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.

That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area.

And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body, but it's also -- 

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

(Laughter) Richard.

That's the other way that humor -- like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.

There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though, which is, as much as we revere the head, we are very anti-intellectual.

(Laughter) So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

(Laughter) So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

(Laughter) So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

(Laughter) I don't know how many of you have read it.

And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 

(Laughter) But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 

So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.

(Laughter) It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

(Laughter) It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

(Laughter) It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S&amp;M way.

It's the subject subjugating the object.

That's how you assert yourself.

You make yourself the active voice.

And the object is the passive no-voice. 

I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.

So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. 

And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.

There's a poll that proves -- there was a poll that was given by Time magazine, in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked?"

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- (Laughter) That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.

(Laughter) Maybe too far.

(Laughter) Maybe too far.

(Laughter) Maybe too far.

I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots, which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.

(Laughter) What's funny about being down to four houses?

(Laughter) What's funny about being down to four houses?

(Laughter) What's funny about being down to four houses?

(Laughter) And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or, Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

(Laughter) And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or, Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

(Laughter) And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or, Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way.

I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin, who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.

There always had to be the butt of a joke.

And in stand-up of course, the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.

A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate, and overcome the heckler.

And I got good at that when I was in stand up.

And I was looking for a form that didn't have that.

And so I wanted something that was more interactive.

I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers. 

I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.

(Laughter) I do, because at least there you stood a chance.

(Laughter) I do, because at least there you stood a chance.

(Laughter) I do, because at least there you stood a chance.

(Laughter) I do, because at least there you stood a chance.

I used to actually hang up on them.

But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) He hung up on me! 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world.

And that's really what I'm looking for.

And it was like being psychoanalyzed.

I mean he had laid it all out.

Trickster is a change agent.

And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen.

And one of these is boundary crossing.

I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.

But I like to cross boundaries.

I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?

I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see.

Like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself.

He was a very selfish meme.

And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly.

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And you know people, this is the problem with quote, objectivity, unquote.

When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you, or share the same set of assumptions as you, you start to think that that's reality.

Like economists, you know, their definition of rational, that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.

Well, look at Michael Hawley, or look at Dean Kamen, or look at my grandmother. 

(Laughter) If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom, my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

(Laughter) If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom, my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

(Laughter) If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom, my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) "No, you take the prize.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

That's an actual quality of the trickster.

And another is, non-oppositional strategies.

And this is instead of contradiction.

Where you deny the other person's reality, you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist, 

I think there's another philosophical construction.

I'm not sure what it's called.

(Laughter) There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

(Laughter) There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

(Laughter) There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) "Oh no.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck.

That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents, this is another quality of the trickster.

The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.

That, and I will say this to the scientists, that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas.

I had no joke for that.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But here's how I think I like to make change, and that is in making connections.

This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions.

Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

(Laughter) And the other one though is impenetrability. 

Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity.

Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator.

And then, in economics, there's an active producer and a passive consumer, which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets.

Well yeah, I mean why we forced China to open her markets.

And didn't that feel good?

(Laughter) And now we're being penetrated.

You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes.

You know we're being penetrated.

And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.

(Laughter) That's the second of the quadruple.

(Laughter) That's the second of the quadruple.

(Laughter) That's the second of the quadruple.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And what I hope to do, when I make these connections, is short circuit people's thinking.

It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition, it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think -- I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.

have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?

And the mother is elderly.

And the mother goes right through a red light.

And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.

She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition.

That completes the quadruple. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I just want to say two more things.

One is, another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line.

He has to have poise.

And you know the biggest hurdle for me, in doing what I do, is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared.

Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.

But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen. 

But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing.

You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time.

It's an actual thing.

And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.

But if you don't do that, if you allow for the accident to keep on happening, you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.

I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.

When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility.

And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home.

He's always on the road.

And thank you for inviting me into it.

Thank you very much.
