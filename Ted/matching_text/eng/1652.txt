And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, or don't understand, or is foreign to them.

So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do, don't stare at her legs."

Somebody that might even be super-abled.

Interesting. 

TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.

At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.

This started an incredible journey.

What does a beautiful woman have to look like?

What is a sexy body?

(Laughter) 

Poetry matters.

Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art.

It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look, and look a little longer, and maybe even understand. 

I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.

And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal.

(Laughter) Today, I'm 6'1".

And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 5'8".

A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.

I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity, we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have.
