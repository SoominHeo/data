Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas to see one of Maestro Abreu's great proteges.

Gustavo Dudamel!

We are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world.

We can speak only with music.

He has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams.

And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela.

We hope to have, our Maestro, to have orchestras in all the countries in all Americas.

And we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of America.
