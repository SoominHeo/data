I took my shoes off to dance, but maybe I'll get at that later.

Anyways, I... where to start?

My mom taught me to dance when I was five, and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.

My uncle is a very well-known Cape Breton fiddler.

There are four girls a little bit older than me.

We grew up without a television.

People find that strange, but I think it was a great blessing for us.

We had a television for a few years, but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done, so out went the television. 

(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of, we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) Well I guess I have to now.

Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married, but anyway, so, then I got a phone call about, I dunno, seven years later.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it.

I starts out with a slow air.

Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player.

I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) So we're gonna play something together anyway. 

NM: With one minute. 

(Laughter) 

DL: What do you want to play? 

NM: Uh, sure. 

DL: How fast? 

The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome.

Anyway, I'm blabbering on here. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) We openedâ€” 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Will we play a tune? 

Okay, play in, how about A?
