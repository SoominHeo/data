AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.

I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.

They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs, and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years.

So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break, his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.

AM: In these? 

(Audience: Who made them?)

SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
