(Laughter) It's a thought.

And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up, which we won't see tonight.

With that, let's get the first slide up here.

This, as many of you have probably guessed, is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal.

You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B. I mean, how nice is that?

Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

You know, it's pretty clear.

Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message.

O.K., which one would you park in front of?

(Laughter) Same color, same message, same words.

I would probably park in front of the other one. 

I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.

It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.

(Laughter) And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.

(Laughter) He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This is from my second book.

The first book is called, "The End of Print," and it was done along with a film, working with William Burroughs.

And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.

And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it.

It's something everybody has.

So it tends to get discounted.

I like this for a couple of reasons.

If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.

I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.

More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.

So, what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?

And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. 

And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.

So, this was the contents page originally.

But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.

(Laughter) It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Applause) "People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."

(Laughter) (Applause) "People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."

So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.

And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden, and it was done right after 9/11.

This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver, where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.

And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture.

Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

(Laughter) I don't have the site.

This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment -- asked me to do these posters.

They were wild-posted around New York City.

You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.

(Laughter) And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.

It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something; it looked like they might be real.

Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida. 

I was in the Caribbean at Christmas, and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.

This was either an old product with new packaging, or a brand-new package, and I just thought, Yikes!

I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.

It was a worldwide branding campaign.

They thought some people didn't like them.

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 

And we were trying to say that, hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK; some of them actually have friends and family, and they're not all awful people.

And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."

So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it.

You know: Thank God it's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls, and hear everybody else's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home. 

And this is how the ad ran around the world.

In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.

This is some work from Ray Gun.

And the point of this magazine was to read the articles, listen to the music, and try to interpret it.

There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.

This is an opener for Brian Eno, and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.

This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.

There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Having done a lot of magazines, I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories, and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.

And People magazine, I thought, got probably the best shot.

It's kind of horsey type, but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting: there was something more enticing, if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. 

But when I got into this magazine, there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.

On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.

And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.

The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.

And this continued through the entire magazine.

There were a lot of orphans made this day, and here's a dead body being brought out.

It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate.

And this one I think is possibly the worst: two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.

One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. 

This was what they found on their car.

(Laughter) There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. 

(Laughter) There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.

(Laughter) There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. 

This is my desktop.

We are wrapping up. 

This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.

If you ever doubt the power of graphic design, this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler."

As we get more technically driven, the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.

If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. 

This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way, and I thought this was a great example of both.

(Laughter) But more importantly, she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.

And I'm thinking, yeah, right, I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.

(Laughter) I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.

And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.

That's pretty high for most occupations.

(Laughter) But, you know, the government would make a plane; they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?

Some of them did; some of them didn't. 

(Laughter) And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.

(Laughter) And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.

Why not put some of yourself into the work?

And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
