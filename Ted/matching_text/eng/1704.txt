Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

A cheery thought.

On this map, every country that’s colored blue has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.

This is the world we live in.

And this is the world your children will live in.

For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.

It’s already flattening out.

By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.

This is why it’s happening.

Right now, those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.

It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.

Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami.

So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape, to hold the protein into its proper shape.

That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.

And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now, but which we’re fascinated by.

Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies.

In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen, here’s what you can do for yourself.

And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.

And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects, "use it or lose it" applies, so you want to stay mentally stimulated.

Because the clock is ticking for all of us.

Thank you.
