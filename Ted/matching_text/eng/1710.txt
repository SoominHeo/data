I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.

Sometimes I used to walk more at night.

And so I was following this guy.

But I do that all the time.

Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn, there was actually someone thought of that thought already.

Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. 

I don't know where inspiration comes from.

It does not come for me from research.

I don't get necessarily inspired by research.

As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things I've ever, ever done in my whole life, was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.

I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.

And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.

And I saw this really smart critic who I love.

I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.

The color of movies and the way light makes the colors, light from behind the projection, or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.

And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.

I go back to color all the time.

Color is something that motivates me a lot.

I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act.

So actually, check this out.

The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother.

It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.

I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.

Yeah, exactly. 

I will show you this next thing, speaking of costumes for operas.

I do work with different choreographers.

And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.

Actually, could you roll the clip, please?

This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. 

IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like, really messed up, you know what I mean?

ROD: We're just staging it. 

Chef: Do you?
