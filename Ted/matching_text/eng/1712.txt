First of all -- any questions so far?

First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.

(Laughter) I am fine.

(Laughter) I am fine.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.

It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book.

So the reading would be over very quickly.

So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.

You won't be familiar with it.

Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.

And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day.

So I decided to give him a little support, and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

And I can show here a very good example.

It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.

(Laughter) Yeah.

(Laughter) Yeah.

The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured.

And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.

Yeah, that's great.

So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.

If my room back home had looked like this, my mother would have grounded me for three days.

So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.

And that's really advanced tidying up.

(Laughter) We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese.

We are only happy when things are in order. 

But to go on, here is a very good example to see.

This is a picture by Joan Miro.

And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.

And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.

(Laughter) And this is my -- (Laughter) -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.

It's more economical and also more efficient.

With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. 

But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.

(Laughter) I'll just quote from the specification.

Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.

I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.

I would like to do a short test with you.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.

This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.

And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.

But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.

So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.

(Laughter) This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

One can obviously also make combinations.

In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.

Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet, put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.

(Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience.

(Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience.

(Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience.

(Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience.

(Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.

And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.

You know, there is a -- (Laughter) I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.

It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.

So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.

So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.

By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.

But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.

(Laughter) And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.

And when I returned it looked like this.

(Laughter) Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) Yeah?

Some people would make apple pie out of it.

But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.

(Applause) Or you could go into three-dimensional art.

Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.

Here I just brought it back to its original state.

(Laughter) But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know -- Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.

The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat, and I collected together all his dots.

And now they're all in here.

(Laughter) You can count them afterwards, if you like.

There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.

I mean, it's "the future we will create."

(Laughter) But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.

This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.

That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.

(Laughter) Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went?

(Laughter) Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went?

(Laughter) Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went?

(Laughter) I just piled them up.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.

And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.

And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.

(Laughter) But before leaving I would like to show you, I'm working right now on another -- in a related field with my tidying up art method.

And I started to bring some order into some flags.

Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.

(Laughter) And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.

(Laughter) Yeah, that was a hard one.

(Laughter) Yeah, that was a hard one.

(Applause)
