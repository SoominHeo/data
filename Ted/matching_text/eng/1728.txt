Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.

Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding.

Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this.

As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time, if you assume that all magnets had to be hard, then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. 

So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.

If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.

For me, I really love this idea.

(Laughter) If you come to my apartment and see my closet, I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.

KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.

But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference. 

As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.

When we were going in the car back to the airport, we were thinking: why was this so powerful?

And as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on TV.

Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?

Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.

Aqua Rocket: coming this summer. 

ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.

So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.

This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.

The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.

Now this is important for two reasons.

One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.

In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right, the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.

So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.

The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.

It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.

When you get to the very bottom of the slide -- (Laughter) -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.

And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint. 

So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.

(Laughter) Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.

Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force. 

(Laughter) There're a few different versions of it.

(Laughter) KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.

They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between. 

ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently -- he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is, you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.

(Laughter) So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.

Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way.

Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.

Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.

Woman: An olive server.

Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.

(Laughter)

ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. 

Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future.

(Laughter) So here, come on up to the front.

(Laughter) So here, come on up to the front.

SJ: It's cold. 

It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.

It's so safe you could drink this stuff.

(Laughter) And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water.

(Laughter) All right, well thanks for coming up.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends.

SJ: Excellent, thank you. 

So what's the significance of this dry liquid?

Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.

So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.

You can circulate it to draw the heat away.

But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game.

While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.

We have a video to show you. 

It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."

ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle.

For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.

So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. 

KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.

So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.

Now, to think about the potential for this, think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards, on the back of cereal boxes, board games.

ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.

In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes. 

KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. 

Don't let milk spoil your morning. 

ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys: Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois. 

So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow.

But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect, then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. 

His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn, how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?

(Laughter) I mean, this is a true story.

(Laughter) I mean, this is a true story.

(Laughter) But more seriously, they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans, and say if it's safe for the firemen.

In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing, where they're working on medical equipment.

So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.

By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses, or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results.

This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.

Currently, they're using a method of trial and error, but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. 

KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating.

Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world.

ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.

And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said, "Look, hydrophobic string."

(Laughter) I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.

Thank you very much. 

Thank you very much.
