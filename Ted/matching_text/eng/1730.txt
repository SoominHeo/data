How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies?

What about ourselves?

But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?

This is a European society with literate records, so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.

In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland, and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed, and every one of them ended up dead. 

In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s.

The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society.

What about a society today?

So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.

Are there any general conclusions that arise?

An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.

How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?

I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.

What's going to be the outcome today?

The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course, which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.

And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.

The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms: either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action, or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war, disease or starvation.
