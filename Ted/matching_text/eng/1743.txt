I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning, and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.

The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. 

I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.

Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.

They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.

Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable. 

It puts a human face on issues which, from afar, can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. 

Thank you very much.
