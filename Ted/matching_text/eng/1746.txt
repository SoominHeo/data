I was here about four years ago, talking about the relationship of design and happiness.

All of these things are pieces of graphic design.

These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.

The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.

And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building.

So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.

It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street, it says, "does not make me happy."

We had a show that just came down last week in New York.

And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart, because all of these sentiments -- some banal, some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary.

And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.

If it's -- see it for a long enough time, I actually do something about it.

And the very last one is a billboard.

This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.

This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.

We let that lie around in the sun.

As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.
