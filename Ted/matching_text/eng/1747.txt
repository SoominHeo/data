What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.

And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now, where we don't have robots everywhere.

Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.

And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?

Are they going to be around in 50 years?

Computers sort of came around through games and toys.

On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.

And just as in the early days, when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers, you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.

And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics, where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff.

And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys -- the Sony Aibo.

But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there. 

And then in the last 12 months or so we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.

But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.

And let me just show you that.

We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.

This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.

(Laughter) Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!

(Laughter) Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!

(Laughter) See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.

It's grown-ups that get really upset.

(Laughter) We'll just put some crap here.

(Laughter) We'll just put some crap here.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.

(Laughter) I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.

(Laughter) I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.

(Laughter) I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.

And that's true with a lot of robots.

Here's another robot, the PackBot, that we've been building for a bunch of years.

It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves, for instance.

But we had to make it fairly robust, much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.

(Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux.

(Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux.

(Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux.

(Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux.

A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.

That was not a controlled descent.

(Laughter) Now it's going to head off.

And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.

We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.

Let's run this video.

Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.

Nick Robertson has that story.

Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?

Okay, good.

The robot's being totally autonomous.

The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. 

So one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.

Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.

And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.

There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.

Thanks.

And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.

But robots like this, they're a little hard to program.

(Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to show this robot a task.

(Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to show this robot a task.

(Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to show this robot a task.

And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.

And I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

(Laughter) Okay.

I didn't show you how to do that.

Now see if you can put it back together.

(Laughter) And he thinks a robot has to be really slow.

Good robot, that's good. 

So we saw a bunch of things there.

We saw when we're interacting, we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.

I just want to show you one technical diagram here.

The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system.

Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.

And it looks for things that move around.

At the same time, some top-down sort of stuff: might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone, or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.

And so these weights change. 

And over here on the right, this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.

remember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot, looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?

And it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.

So, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's Kismet, looking around for a toy.

It sees her, pays attention to her.

Kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space, a vector space, of where it is emotionally.

RB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice.

Voice: Nice robot.

You're such a cute little robot.

(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 

(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 

(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 

(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 

(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

These are naive subjects.

Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. 

Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

RB: I'm going to leave it at that. 

And then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.

So we put this in the robot.

We got a bunch of naive subjects in, we didn't tell them anything about the robot, sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.

(Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.

(Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.

(Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.

(Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.

(Laughter) So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs.

And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?

(Laughter) And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies.

(Laughter) And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies.

Well, do you ever need to give robots respect?

They're just machines, after all.

But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.

After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.

If we are machines, then in principle at least, we should be able to build machines out of other stuff, which are just as alive as we are.

But I think for us to admit that, we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.

And we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years, at least.

And to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us.

But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so. 

And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.

(Laughter) But Hollywood extends it to the robots.

And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard, you know -- "I accidentally built a 747."

I don't think that's going to happen.

And I don't think -- (Laughter) -- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with.

We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.

Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot, and before that a not so bad robot.

(Laughter) And we're just not going to let it go that way.

(Laughter) And we're just not going to let it go that way.
