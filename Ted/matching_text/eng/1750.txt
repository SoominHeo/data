So, I decided to investigate. 

I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.

It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. 

Why were other people blocking it?

Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"

And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.

I'm telling you where I'm insecure.

I'm telling you where I need your help.

Because what can you do with that data?

You could neglect me.

You could abuse it.

Or you could actually meet my need. 

So, I'm going to challenge all of you.

Go home to your husband -- what does he need?

Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. 

And it's simple.

And why should we care about this?

We talk about world peace.

How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?

I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.

So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
