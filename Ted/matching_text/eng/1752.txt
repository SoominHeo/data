What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?

And that's actually the good news. 

This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.

I think that when that is the focus of your life, these are the things that happen.

You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.

These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s, or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes, in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.

I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure.

On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?

Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century, we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.

How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive?
