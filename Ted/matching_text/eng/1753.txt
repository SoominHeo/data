Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.

The first guy -- we'll call him Adam -- is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.

The second guy -- we'll call him Bill -- is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.

We all know that it's Bill.

And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.

It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience.

People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.

People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable. 

If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.

(Laughter) This trait also tells us a lot about politics.

This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.

So here's the description of a group I found on the Web.

What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?

This is from some guy named Ted.

Let's find out.

I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center -- on social issues, we're talking about, primarily -- or conservative, and I'll give a third option, because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience.

Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.

OK, about a -- two dozen.

And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.

One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10. 

Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.

Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking.

When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.

(Laughter) (Applause) So, if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way, then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix, in a particular moral matrix.

And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."

But I'm here today to give you a choice.

You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions, or you can take the red pill, learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.

Now, because I know -- (Applause) -- OK, I assume that answers my question.

I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.

So anyway, let's go with the red pill.

Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. 

Let's start at the beginning.

What is morality and where does it come from?

The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.

Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others.

The best definition of innateness I've ever seen -- this just clarifies so many things for me -- is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.

To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I read through the literature on anthropology, on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.

We found five -- five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality. 

The first one is harm/care.

This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. 

The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.

That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. 

The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.

You do find groups in the animal kingdom -- you do find cooperative groups -- but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.

This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.

We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives. 

The fourth foundation is authority/respect.

It's based on more voluntary deference, and even elements of love, at times. 

The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.

It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body.

And while the political right may moralize sex much more, the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.

Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays, and a lot of it is ideas about purity, about what you're willing to touch, or put into your body. 

But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town, how is this first draft going to get revised?

And how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?

To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.

If there really are five systems at work in the mind -- five sources of intuitions and emotions -- then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels, where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.

And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I, made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.

And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.

Here are the results.

Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.

On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals; on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.

The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions. 

So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.

They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board, but as you also see, liberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down.

Same story for fairness.

But look at the other three lines.

For liberals, the scores are very low.

Liberals are basically saying, "No, this is not morality.

But as people get more conservative, the values rise.

We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel, or two-foundation morality.

Conservatives have more of a five-foundation, or five-channel morality. 

We find this in every country we look at.

Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians.

I'll just flip through a few other slides.

Which shows that within any country, the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.

Everybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair -- but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.

Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity. 

This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.

Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!"

Because liberals like to say, "Fetch, please."

(Laughter) But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.

So, you might say, OK, there are these differences between liberals and conservatives, but what makes those three other foundations moral?

Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism?

What makes them moral?

The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch, "The Garden of Earthly Delights."

In the first panel, we see the moment of creation.

All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.

Some of you might recognize this as the '60s.

(Laughter) But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s, where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.

Of course, Bosch called this hell. 

So this triptych, these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.

The truth of social entropy.

So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.

But you really want everybody else to sacrifice, but everybody has a temptation to a free ride.

There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.

It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.

It really helps to have some sort of punishment.

Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate.

There's even some recent research suggesting that religion -- priming God, making people think about God -- often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior. 

Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere, in part for the purpose of trusting each other, and then being more effective at competing with other groups.

I think that's probably right, although this is a controversial issue.

But I'm particularly interested in religion, and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.

Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.

The Grand Canyon is really simple.

It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time, and you get the Grand Canyon.

It's not that complicated.

This is what's really complicated, that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon, cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa, or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.

The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.

It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups.

Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm, you do need a psychology of justice.

But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.

And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives.

Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.

Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.

So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.

Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.

They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.

The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.

It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.

This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.

You find the same thing in Hinduism.

This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.

You have the markings of Vishnu on the left, so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.

You have the markings of Shiva on the right, Shiva's the liberal god.

You find the same thing in Buddhism.

These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology.

But before you feel superior to George Bush, before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?

Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?

Can you be not for or against anything? 

This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much, using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money, to make the world a better place, to fight -- to fight wrongs, to solve problems. 

But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right."

Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.

A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people.

Step out.

And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility, to get yourself out of this self-righteousness, which is the normal human condition.

Think about the Dalai Lama.

So I think the point -- the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.

People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place.

But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.

And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.
