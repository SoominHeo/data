So what's image got do with it?

But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about.

So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.

We're not the only ones. 

Just think about that, you know?

And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff.

Now, why is that a problem?

And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?

And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.

We start with poverty.

I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family.

Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.

The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.

And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.

So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.

And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term.

You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.

Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money.

But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did. 

They talk about corruption.

In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.

And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools.

My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school.

So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.

And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there.

And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know?

They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now.

And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.

And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.

Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on.

But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.

And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on. 

The first time he got sick, he recovered.

But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.

He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.

And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it.

And that kept him going.

At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash.

The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.

At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation.

And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him. 

And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me.

And this is how you look at Africa.

This is the damage it causes.

You don't see the other side of me.

You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know?

And I just wanted to personalize that.

And I was just moved.

I was actually crying during his presentation.

And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.

So, what is to be done?

First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.

We heard about that yesterday.

We had some of them this morning.

And this is an example, you know, blogging is one way of doing that.

Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.

So we need to start getting better.

If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.

And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia.

He's the only African who's contributing to this. 

What are we doing?

Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?

Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa.

So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives.

No, you're not. 

But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize.

And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay?

You know, just jump.

The continent needs you.

And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.

I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures.

With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems.

And because I'm needed here, you know?

I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing. 

I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.

We're now moving into East Africa.

And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity.

I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs.

Everything else on there is a labor of love.

We've manually entered all the data there.

And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament.

We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions.

There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask. 

And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians.

You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.

You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart.

And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.

What are they doing?

Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society.

We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?

They come from us.

I believe in the power of ideas.

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. 

The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual.

I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa.

People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"

And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know.

My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.

I was helping her pay her tuition.

My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.

I was paying her school fees. 

You know, she's now my baby sister.

And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people.

He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.

And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."

Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school.

And this is just an illustration. 

You can meet other individuals here.

We just need a push.

That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.

Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?

A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential.

You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave.

And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born.

That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?

That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move.

Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are.

For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life.

I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us.

And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.

Thank you.
