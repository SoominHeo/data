I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.

And I like to immerse myself in my topics.

I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.

And I see my life as a series of experiments. 

It was a wonderful experience. 

More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty.

And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth.

So, I decided I would try this for a month.

This was the worst month of my life.

(Laughter) I do not recommend this at all.

To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."

(Laughter) So, that was hard. 

(Laughter) So, that was hard. 

(Laughter) So, that was hard. 

(Laughter) So, that was hard. 

(Laughter) So, that was hard. 

Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.

You can just Google it.

So, I wasted some time there. 

And I undertook this for two reasons.

The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

(Laughter) So, not very.

But I've become increasingly interested in religion.

So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible. 

The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.

Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find.

And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.

And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.

So I wanted to follow those.

But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.

As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.

(Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.

So, certainly the challenge was there. 

You only know if you try it.

I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.

(Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip.

(Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip.

(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 

(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 

(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 

(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 

(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 

And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.

The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.

This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person.

You change your behavior, and you change your mind.

So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate.

You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause.

The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America.

And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.

(Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it.

So, I was able to stone one adulterer.

I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.

But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.

How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others?

How should we view the Bible?

Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?

How was the Bible written?

And it's sort of evolved.

It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. 

So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation.

So, you know, I met with creationists.

I went to the creationists' museum.

And these are the ultimate literalists.

And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.

I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.

It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model.

And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. 

And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.

They really did a fantastic job.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong.

It's a remarkable thing. 

Third, that thou shall have reverence.

So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God. 

(Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go."

(Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go."

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.

And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.

They have a pamphlet that says, "Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality," and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.

So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people.

So, this was very inspiring to me.

And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed.

So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. 

And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.

And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible.

And I failed miserably.

The key is to pick and choose the right parts.

But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"

So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. 

And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.

There's me reading the Bible.

That's how I hailed taxicabs.

(Laughter) Seriously, and it worked.

(Laughter) Seriously, and it worked.

So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
