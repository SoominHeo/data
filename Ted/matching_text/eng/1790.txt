I had a fire nine days ago.

I mean, this was -- was I my things?

I always live in the present -- I love the present. 

I cherish the future.

That's my papers. 

That was a desk took 40-some years to build.

You know -- all the stuff.

Idea about women. 

That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.

I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.

The negatives are gone. 

That's my house.

My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.

My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago. 

I came to live it, and I am living it.
