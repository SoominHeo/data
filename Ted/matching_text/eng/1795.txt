Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier.

So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.

And I want to tell you that story.

I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.

It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.

We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.

Craig Venter chairs that event. 

Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.

You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.

Come back down, you weigh twice as much.

We set out to do this.

It took us 11 years to become operational.

And he wanted to go.

We worked hard to get all the permissions.

And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.

Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.

And what he said, for me, was very moving.

We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane. 

A few TEDsters here.

We set up a whole ER.

We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.

We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands. 

And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great.

So we did a second parabola. 

We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.

And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth. 

And a seventh and an eighth.

And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man. 

He was so happy.

We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.

Please join us in this epic adventure.

Thank you so much.
