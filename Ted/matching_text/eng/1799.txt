This is a work in process, based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.

Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration.

It's one of those things that stuck in my head.

There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.

One has a working fluid, water and ammonia, and the other is a condenser.

You let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect.

So, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up.

But it was kind of an interesting thought. 

So, the great thing about 2006 is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.

We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures.

Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people, it turned out, in the U.K. -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator. 

So, this is the way it works.

You put it on a cooking fire.

Most people have cooking fires in the world, whether it's camel dung or wood.

It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.

Weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.

You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.

We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars, in low volumes for about 40 dollars.

And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have.
