I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.

And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.

There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid. 

And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.

Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. 

And I realized then I had to go to design school.

(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there.

(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)

And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.

And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.

And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.

And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.

And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.

But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.

So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.

And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.

So, the light bulb actually does that.

It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.

And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.

And this is what we're pursuing here. 

But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.

I want to point at something here, on the left.

This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.

It's really about designing from the inside out.

And it's what I call being design driven.

You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. 

And then, of course, design is never done.

But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?

And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.

And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.

The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.

And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it. 

Here's another project, which I think really emulates that.

This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.

This picture is incredible.

In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.

This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.

I mean, to me, it just means so much.

But the third pillar that he talked about was design.

And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment. 

In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.

So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible. 

(Laughter) And it was a prototype.

(Laughter) And it was a prototype.

(Laughter) And it was a prototype.

(Laughter) And it was a prototype.

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard. 

(Laughter) Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.

And we also designed the condoms themselves. 

I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.

Of course, clubs and discos, too.

I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them.

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) Yeah?

(Laughter) (Applause) So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.

(Laughter) (Applause) So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.

(Laughter) And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.

(Laughter) And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.
