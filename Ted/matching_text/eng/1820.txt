Thank you very much.

I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.

Thank you very much. 

So we are past our 1,000th show.

Probably somewhere around 1,500.

It's hard to know.

We've only done two shows in 2007 so far, but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.

We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.

How early can a rock performance begin?

Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning.

I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic.

All right. 

So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence.

This song is called "Asbury Park."

It's based on a real life experience. 

Marty Beller on the drums over there. 

This song is called "Fingertips."

♫ at the window?♫ 

We're soliciting phone calls from dead people as a special TED presentation.

We're taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey.

And I think we have a caller coming in here.

Hello there.

Am I on the air?

Hi there.

You're on with They Might Be Giants.

This is Eleanor Roosevelt.

I've got a question for Randi.

What's your question, please?

I want to talk to the Amazing Randi.

Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor?

I want my million dollars.

No, I don't have a badge.

Well, I think we're going to stop that part of the show. 

Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED.

You've been a wonderful 8:30 audience.

Have a great session.

Thank you all.
