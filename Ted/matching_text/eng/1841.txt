And I want to urge you, when you get a chance, to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs. 

It's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. 

If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day, that might not be so big a claim.

In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe. 

We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe, all the way back in time, almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.

We can see across the entire spectrum of light, revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.

Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.

And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.

We're going to have a personal universe.

I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge. 

And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.

The whole resources are there available for you.
