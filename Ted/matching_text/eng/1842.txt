BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.

Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented. 

DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. 

BF: Also three with his left. 

(Audience: Once on purpose!)

DH: How about if I try first and then decide? 

And then we thought, "How stupid."

DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone? 

He actually assumes more of the danger in this. 

DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks) 

Richard Wurman: Can I say something?

BF: Sure. 

DH: All right, please stand here in front ... God, I hate that.

DH: Wow, you've been working out. 

There you go. 

DH: First one. 

What happened there? 

BF: We've got one more we're going to do. 

RW: Do I get to hold them? 

DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit? 

Could you just push that? 

So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.

And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ... 

BF: I'm going to run up behind him. 

DH: Leap over my shoulder. 

BF: Up and over his shoulders. 

DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ... 

BF: Incredible, you say? 

DH: Why bother, you say? 

BF: Here we go. 

DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? 

BF: He invented the pencil. 

BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see. 

Or a virgin for a sacrifice? 

BF: Anything? 

DH: Do you have a small farm animal?

DH: Everything up here's OK? 

BF: Yeah. 

DH: Then here we go. 

BF: We're going on. 

BF: There we go! 

BF: One more quick thing. 

DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2. 

DH: That's right. 

BF: Juggling's got a bad rap. 

Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do? 

What gem of knowledge?

BF: Yes. 

BF: Seven-club juggling. 

DH: ... to back. 

DH: Thank you very much!
