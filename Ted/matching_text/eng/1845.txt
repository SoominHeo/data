And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.

And sometimes if I have too much coffee, then my vibrato gets out of hand.

You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing.

You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.

And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) -- and breathing will make it ... 

If I pass out on the next song ... (Laughter) 

I think we will play another tune now.
