(Applause) 

And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are, literally, world premieres.

I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. 

I wish I had that when I was in college.

(Applause) 

That's the first time I've ever played it.

that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.

It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems.

One thing is, it's unpronounceable.

And it's a made-up word.

It's called "Tembererana."

And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces.

So "tembererana" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.

So this is called "Tembererana."

It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called "carnivalito."

(Applause)
