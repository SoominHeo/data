Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.

If you are scared by global warming, wait until we learn about local warming.

We will talk today about local warming. 

(Laughter) 

Will geeks become endangered species?

(Applause) Global warming fun.

(Laughter) But let's keep things in proportion. 

(Applause) 

(Laughter) 

And then our next talk, our next TED if you invite me will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket.

(Applause) And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching, but I also practice.

(Applause) 

(Applause) Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?

(Applause)
