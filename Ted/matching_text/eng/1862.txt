I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.

All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them.

(Laughter) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.

One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony, of the opening ceremony, called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers.

Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.

(Laughter) I was told that this was no laughing matter.

This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.

Five women, representing five continents, and three Olympic gold medal winners.

My first question was, naturally, what was I going to wear?

(Laughter) A uniform, she said, and asked for my measurements.

My measurements.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

By the middle of February, I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.

Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.

They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.

A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind, can determine the result of a race or a game.

However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.

Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.

It is all about passion.

The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics. 

Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.

I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution.

When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.

And of brothels where children are forced to receive five, 15 clients per day, and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.

In the green room I received my uniform.

I looked like a refrigerator.

Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.

Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?

I don't know.

No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium.

The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls.

The protagonists of this story are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.

She's pregnant and a widow.

Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.

Two tiny little boys.

She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.

Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.

I look around and I see them everywhere.

I have worked with women and for women all my life.

They have no control over their bodies or their lives.

They have no education and no freedom.

They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.

The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.

She's prepared to clean teeth, but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors, no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.

Outside, there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated.

The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.

Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.

She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.

She risks a lot and she's terrified.

She doesn't even have the proper instruments, but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.

Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.

At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.

That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.

The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic, her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.

The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.

The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.

The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him. 

Millions of women live like this today.

They are the poorest of the poor.

Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor, they own less than one percent of the world's assets.

It is a fact that giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society.

If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off.

If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country. 

Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.

She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees.

The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down.

For every dollar given to a women's program, 20 dollars are given to men's programs.

Women are 51 percent of humankind.

I can promise you that women working together -- linked, informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.

Men run the world, and look at the mess we have. 

What kind of world do we want?

This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.

Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?

They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power, in the voluminous Botero style.

I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart.

What I fear most is power with impunity.

I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.

In our species, the alpha males define reality, and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules.

Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.

Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.

Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child.

I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender, income, race, and class. 

I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization.

But for real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world.

I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.

Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

(Laughter) Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts.

But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.

I want to make this world good.

Thank you. 

Thank you.
