And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied.

The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.

And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced. 

One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand.

Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. 

These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow.

And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies.

How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future.
