Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain, the functions and structure of the human brain.

And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.

OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?

I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells, little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other, and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness.

How does this happen?

What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities, a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.

So that's what we're trying to do. 

So let me give you a few striking examples of this.

In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.

The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.

If you look at the first slide there, that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK -- the lobes that constitute the brain.

And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.

You can still recognize them from their voice and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe," but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?

You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.

I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks, and you know it's a mirror, but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. 

OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.

Now, why does this happen?

Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects, but when he sees his mother, his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother. 

This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.

I'm not saying I believe this, but this is the standard Freudian view.

And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops, and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.

Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.

And then what happens is, there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex, allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge, flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.

This has never made much sense to me, this argument.

It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are -- (Laughter) -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion, a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.

(Laughter) He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi.

(Laughter) He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi.

(Laughter) He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi.

(Laughter) He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi.

(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course. 

(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.

(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course. 

Now, what's really going on?

So, to explain this curious disorder, we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.

Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs, go to the visual areas in the brain.

There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision, and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.

There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.

And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.

So I can determine, when you're looking at something, whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?

And I'll get to that in a minute. 

So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his -- any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and, however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus, and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table, or your mother, for that matter, OK?

And then the message cascades into the amygdala, and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.

But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system, the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.

How do you test this?

And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother -- I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, what happens if you show this patient?

You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response.

Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people, but when you show him a picture of his mother, the galvanic skin response is flat.

So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal, his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth -- but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.

It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do: take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong, that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain. 

By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you?

There's no delusion through the phone.

The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers, and that's not been cut by the accident.

OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?

Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?

And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.

And you all know what a phantom limb is.

In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.

Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.

I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy -- who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month.

And in fact, one student asked me the other day, "Do they get phantom PMS?"

(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 

(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 

(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 

(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 

(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 

OK, now the next question is, what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?

One of the things we've found was, about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom.

It'll pat his brother on the shoulder, it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.

These are very compelling, vivid sensations.

The patient's not delusional.

He knows that the arm is not there, but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.

Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?

It sounds like an oxymoron.

And this is a serious clinical problem.

So, how do you treat this syndrome?

Why does this happen?

Now, how do you help these patients?

But that costs millions of dollars.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.

It was a paralyzed phantom arm. 

So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box, which I call a mirror box, right?

He knows it's a mirror reflection, but it's a vivid sensory experience.

(Laughter) (Applause) It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.

(Laughter) (Applause) It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.

(Laughter) But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 

(Laughter) But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.

(Laughter) But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 

So, I said, "Look, Derek" -- well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.

So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."

It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.

It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.

So, that's the bonus. 

Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers, nothing you can do about it.

This has also gone through clinical trials, helping lots and lots of patients. 

OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk, which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.

This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.

He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.

He pointed out that certain people in the population, who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity: every time they see a number, it's colored.

Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse, nine is indigo, OK?

Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.

Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.

C sharp is blue, F sharp is green, another tone might be yellow, right? 

In us, all the senses are distinct.

Why would that be?

I'm going to answer that question.

It's never been answered before. 

(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia.

(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia.

(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia.

(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia.

(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia.

So, we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.

So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain.

Why would there be crossed wires in some people?

Remember I said it runs in families?

That gives you the clue.

In all of us, it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else.

So, if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates, then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.

And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.

If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.

So far, so good. 

Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common, the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, linking seemingly unrelated ideas, such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."

Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun, does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?

I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?

Instantly, you've found the links. 

Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain, then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia.

And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets, artists and novelists.

OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.

Here, you've got Martian alphabet.

One of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba.

Well, it's one or two mutants.

(Laughter) How many of you think that's Buba, that's Kiki?

(Laughter) How many of you think that's Buba, that's Kiki?

Ninety-nine percent of you. 

So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.

So, this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower primates.

Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus, because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch, and it became enormous in humans.

All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia, we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging, and by studying patients and asking the right questions.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter)
