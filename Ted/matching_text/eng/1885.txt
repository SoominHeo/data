First of all, I've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."

Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"

My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.

(Laughter) But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.

You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"

There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.

We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason. 

But I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."

I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.

It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.

After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.

And so in my life, I've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity, and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.

So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever, and unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."

And she has this show, "The Simple Life."

(Laughter) So, I looked for a different show to watch.

So, I opened up this TV Guide thing, and on the E!

So, I opened up this TV Guide thing, and on the E!

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

(Laughter) So it was traumatizing, actually. 

So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.

It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."

So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity.

We're human beings: we love complex things.

I'm at this place called the Media Lab.

Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.

It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.

Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.

I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.

This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles, in addition to my previous titles.

It's very hard work to make tofu.

As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.

My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.

My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.

My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.

(Laughter) Thank you.

But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad, and I discovered design later on in my life. 

And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us, she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.

And she's very important in my life, because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.

And she's very important in my life, because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.

She passed away in 1994, and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.

This amazing person, Muriel Cooper. 

When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan -- I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.

Some of you guys know Paul Rand, the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.

The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.

He basically said, "I've designed everything."

When you have mentors -- and yesterday, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors, these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.

This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way, because you can remember them in their pure form.

I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.

When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever, the mentors calm us down.

And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too. 

And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.

So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think. 

I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.

I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.

Lots of complex stuff.

I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.

I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.

And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.

So, I hid in a time dimension.

I built things in a time-graphics dimension.

This is why they have fireworks in the summer.

A very extreme culture.

Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar, because I have so many leaves in my yard.

So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially. 

And so I made a lot of these types of things.

I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things, and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.

She has this show right now at MoMA, where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.

If you're in New York, please go and see that. 

And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.

"Eye candy" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?

So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

(Laughter) And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful, perhaps.

I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.

Computer programs are essentially trees, and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.

So, this is sort of a complication I've found. 

This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.

You can't type very much on this.

I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.

So I focused on food as my area -- these sort of clementine peel things.

If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff, and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that. 

And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know, "Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain," so I made this amber waves image.

It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. 

Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.

And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.

(Laughter) And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.

My hair's clean -- it's okay. 

End of story.

The car is so big, the camera is so small, yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

In the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.

It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something. 

In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.

You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.

So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.

So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity, I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.

But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold, the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose? 

And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain.

I think this is sort of simple more versus less.

Basically, it always depends.

By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.

And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.

Like everything you see, every time you wake up.

This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.

And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Your social responsibility is very interesting.

But if any of you people ask, "What actually goes up?

I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.

And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.

This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.

And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.

And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
