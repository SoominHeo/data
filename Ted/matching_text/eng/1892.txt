I got a visit almost exactly a year ago, a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.

And it can't be done.

I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago, got up to 20 some-odd people.

We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.

We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom; you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.

We showed it to a bunch of guys.

These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. 

But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female, so that we could put it in any of these people.

It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm, to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D -- exact mirror image of their other limb.

I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington.

Going to scratch his nose.

It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.

Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
