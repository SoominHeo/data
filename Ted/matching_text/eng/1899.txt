William Kamkwamba: Thanks. 

WK: Yeah.

WK: Yeah.

WK: I wanted to make a windmill. 

CA: A windmill? 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book. 

CA: What happened? 

WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four -- ah -- three blades, and mine has got four blades. 

CA: The book had three, yours had four. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: And you made it out of what? 

CA: OK. 

CA: OK. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better? 

WK: Yeah.

WK: Yeah.

CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?

What materials did you use? 

WK: Yeah.

WK: Yeah.

CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked? 

WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates. 

CA: How much electricity? 

WK: 12 watts. 

WK: Four bulbs and two radios. 

CA: Wow. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: This is my parents, holding the radio. 

CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time -- what did they make of this?

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this? 

CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one? 

CA: So this one would have to be bigger? 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: How big? 

WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. 

CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village? 

WK: Yeah. 

WK: Yeah. 

CA: Wow.

CA: And as you think of your life going forward, you're 19 now, do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy? 

WK: Yeah.

WK: Yeah.

Thank you so much for coming. 

WK: Thank you.
