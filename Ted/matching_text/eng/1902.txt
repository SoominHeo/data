Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.

Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair. 

But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.

Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.

Do you know that surgery?

Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty. 

But first you need to know two things about me.

Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.

That means we get our new hips for free.

And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything.

So my hip had been hurting me for years.

Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.

That is what free gets you.

I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.

I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.

I would not have my new hip for TED2008.

This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.

Oh yeah. 

Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?

In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.

So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.

Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening.

And I saw a sign.

I worked alone.

Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.

While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"

My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop.

So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.

I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.

And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.

Two reasons.

First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.

Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.
