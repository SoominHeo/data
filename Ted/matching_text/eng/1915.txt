And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.

So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.

(Laughter) So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?

And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. 

More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.

And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. 

And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
