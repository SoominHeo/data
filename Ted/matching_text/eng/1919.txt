Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.

And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point.

The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.

The question is, why?

And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.

They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.

They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.

They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life. 

One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.

They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.

Education is the main event that can happen in cities.

What's going on in the street in Mumbai?

Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.

Now we're shining right back up. 

Thank you.
