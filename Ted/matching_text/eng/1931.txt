Mockingbirds are badass. 

(Laughter) They are.

Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos -- are the emcees of the animal kingdom. 

They listen and mimic and remix what they like.

They rock the mic outside my window every morning.

I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.

So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.

I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. 

Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody. 

And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.

What does a violin have to do with technology?

Where in the world is this world heading?

On one end, gold bars -- on the other, an entire planet.

We are 12 billion light years from the edge.

That's a guess.

There's about 10 million phage per job.

The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes, and here we are, right in the middle. 

It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.

When all the little mockingbirds fly away, they're going to sound like the last four days.

Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.

And I'm on this.
