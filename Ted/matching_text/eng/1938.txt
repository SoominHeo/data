We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness.

And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation, about shape, about color and so forth and it's very primal.

OK. We can violate your expectations about shape.

But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins.

All right, now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise.

And figure goes to ground.

And for the musicians.

And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the world."
