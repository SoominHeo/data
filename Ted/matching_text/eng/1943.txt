About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.

So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.

So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.

(Laughter) On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design. 

So there are, of course, two different possibilities.

This is 1983.

So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.

(Laughter) And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.

You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.

And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss. 

(Laughter) So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.

(Laughter) While, somewhat, the Spaniards ... and, I think, particularly, the Swiss (Laughter), don't seem to be doing all that well.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.

Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.

Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings -- also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.

And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet. 

And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.

This is, you know, a book.

A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.

You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish. 

This is, you know, the movie poster.

They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.

(Laughter) So this is one.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.

(Laughter) I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, True is a real humanitarian.

(Laughter) And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.

You don't see the horizon.

You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.

And the room is truly something to be seen.

People's demeanor changes when they go in there.

And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there. 

There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.

I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.

And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.

(Laughter) And other people go and fill them in.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This one says, "Please let me die in peace."

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And being able to enjoy the end results. 

And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.

And the whole thing just fell together.

So I just picked another one.

This is from the front.

(Laughter) And it's "me."

(Laughter) And it's "me."

(Laughter) And it's "me."

(Laughter) And it's "me."

(Laughter) And it's "me."

(Laughter) And it's "me."
