And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression.

Thank you. 

We've got about a minute left.

I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.

I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.

And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England.

And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.

We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were.

And since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.

This will take about 30 seconds or so.

He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound. 

Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it. 

I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.
