A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.

Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.

And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.

And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.

And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.

I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at. 

And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life.

And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life.

And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.

You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.

Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them. 

And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness.

And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.

I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. 

The first was, how did we get so fast?

Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.

You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.

In other cultures, time is cyclical.

It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.

It's always renewing and refreshing itself.

Whereas in the West, time is linear.

It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.

You either use it, or lose it.

"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.

And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.

Time is scarce, so what do we do?

Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?

We try and do more and more with less and less time.

And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset?

And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.

They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better.

I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.

And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond.

So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space. 

It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, slowness has a role to play.

Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.

You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.

You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.

I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."

And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.

Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France -- too much, too soon, too rigid.

And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy.

And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.

But why is it so hard to slow down?

I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.

Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.

"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.

Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work.

Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. 

Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.

I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.
