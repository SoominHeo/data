A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago.

She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country.

And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.

The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.

And he spent 33 years in prison.

His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet.

And he was beaten, starved, tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.

And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.

So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala.

And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.

That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience. 

So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out.

And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.
