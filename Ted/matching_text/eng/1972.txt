If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.

Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.

You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.

Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions.

If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website.

That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. 

(Laughter) 

Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people. 

(Laughter) 

They would not email you back (Laughter) -- but you'd get an automated reply. 

(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.

(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.

(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.

Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.

I wouldn't need it.

(Laughter) 

I guess it's just like life.

It is not a question of if you can -- it's: do ya?
