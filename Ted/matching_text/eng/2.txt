Rainn Wilson: It takes its toll, being alone.

Who am I? 

I'm a people person.

I keep fit.

Who am I looking for?

I'm looking for my idea mate.

Are you that idea that matches with who I really am? 

(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food?

Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. 

RW: Wow, we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date, huh? 

I want people to know that growing your own food is like printing your own money. 

Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality? 

RW: Well, I'm a little nearsighted, but yeah. 

In fact, even the sensory information that your eyes are receiving, your ears are receiving, is completely meaningless because it could mean anything.

RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd. 

Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your closest living relatives.

Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. 

Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win. 

JM: An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive, you didn't even know it was possible until you achieved it. 

You're not making the face.

You're making the "I'm not good at life" face. 

RW: Do you want to get some pie? 

Reggie Watts: If we're going to do something, we've got to just make a decision.

Because without a decision we're left powerless.

Without power, we have nothing to supply the chain of those who are truly curious to solve all of our current conditions. 

JM: Yes!

RW: So, are we going Dutch? 

RW: One night, want to go to a movie or something? 

Good, now what is this that I'm planting? 

RWatts: Um, interested much? 

RW: I want to have your idea baby. 

RWatts: Well, you know what they say in Russia.
