Jane Fonda: Yes we have. 

PM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship is something that Cervantes said.

(Laughter) 

JF: We're in big trouble. 

(Laughter) 

LT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me. 

(Laughter) 

PM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend? 

LT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun, who's audacious, who's forthcoming, who has politics, who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet, someone who's decent, has a sense of justice and who thinks I'm worthwhile. 

(Laughter) 

I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."

(Laughter) 

They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting.

And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.

(Laughter) 

JF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know -- it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end.

I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you. 

LT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me. 

(Laughter) 

JF: I'm showing you the way. 

(Laughter) 

PM: Well, as we grow older, and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys, what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive? 

LT: Well you have to use a lot of -- 

LT: I have to use a lot of social media -- You be quiet now.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

JF: Do you do emojis? 

LT: Oh ... JF: No? 

LT: I spell it, every letter. 

(Laughter) 

JF: Such a purist.

(Laughter) 

LT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.

JF: That's for sure. 

(Laughter) 

JF: And longer -- 

LT: Joyful lives. 

JF: We live five years longer than men. 

LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy. 

(Laughter) 

JF: And there's something else, too -- 

(Laughter) 

Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.

Which is also increased when we're with our women friends.

And I do think that's one reason why we live longer.

And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that.

Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin. 

JF: I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot. 

(Laughter) If you know what I mean. 

LT: I think we all know what you mean. 

(Laughter) 

PM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.

So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister, who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act, they're a spiritual act.

Do you think of your friends as spiritual?

Do they add something spiritual to your lives? 

LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.

I just see deeply into your soul. 

LT: But I have special powers. 

JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.

(Laughter) 

Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them. 

LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon. 

(Laughter) 

PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about? 

(Laughter) And I always think, when women talk about their friendships, that men always look a little mystified.

(Laughter) 

that they don't have what we have.

Which I think may be why they die sooner. 

(Laughter) 

PM: You're doing great. 

(Laughter) 

JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that of our women friends, and men don't.

You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face, whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side. 

I mean, that's the general, conventional thought.

They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls, or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.

I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior. 

(Laughter) 

They need relationship.

So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?

And the answer is patriarchal culture, which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.

That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.

They don't ask for help.

You know, his sense of self.

Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous.

(Laughter) 

No, but it's a great quote, I think.

We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.

And that's really important. 

LT: But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy.

And we've got to make something different happen. 

JF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power. 

LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.

It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need. 

And if we harness our power, we can change the world.

And we need to do it soon.

We are the ones that need to get off the grid.

We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels.

And the fossil fuel companies -- the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys -- cause they are -- are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age.

There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine.

And the operative word here was "male."

Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal -- 

JF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks. 

(Laughter) 

And wait, no, here's the best part.

It's like, you know, men do need women now.

The planet needs women.

The US Constitution needs women.

We are not even in the Constitution. 

So that would be a good place to start.

Very, very mild -- 

JF: Right. 

PM: Needing new role models on how to do that.

Thank you.

Thank you both. 

JF: Thanks. 

JF: Thanks. 

LT: Thank you.
