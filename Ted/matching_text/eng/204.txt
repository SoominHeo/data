Are you ready? 

Are you ready? 

NP: Get it pops, go ahead. 

Oh my God.

OK, he's trying to battle me.

Hold on, right now, hold on.

Do you remember when you used to beatbox me to sleep? 

EC: Yeah, yeah, I remember.

That's when she was a little baby.

We would do something like this. 

NP: I remember that. 

NP: All right, pops, pops, pops, chill out, chill out.

Hold up, hold up, hold up. 

EC: Y'all remember the video.

NP: Hold up, hold up.

EC: Right, right. 

EC: Beatbox started here in New York. 

Well, we from St. Louis. 

NP: Now you can put y'all hands down. 

So when you would see the beatboxer, you would see us over to the side.

Those were simple beats.

Well, I'm taking that to heart.

We're talking all about this jam session and everything. 

NP: Why don't we give them a little peek, just a tiny bit of our jam session? 

NP: I'm getting ready to go! 

NP: That's it.
