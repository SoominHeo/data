And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited, large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin.

And then there was this other guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22 other people.

That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower. 

It's pretty disgusting.

From the front, you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time.

And when we take a look at that from the side, you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin. 

The first thing I thought was, "This is no good."

And in short, with this system, we win.

And so with this solution, what does this mean for the world?

But now, we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away. 

But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation. 

Thanks.
