my affection is stronger 

my affection is stronger 

and time is running me still 

my affection is stronger 

my affection is stronger 

Thank you. 

Singing is sharing.

When you sing, you have to know what you're talking about intimately, and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself.

And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end, then you are taking, not giving. 

And this is a song that's about -- it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of.

Home is the sound of birds early in the morning 

Home is a song I've always remembered 

Home is the memory of my first day in school 

Home is the books that I carry around 

Home is an alley in a faraway town 

Home is the places I’ve been and where I’d like to go 

I'm always gonna feel at home 

I'm always gonna feel at home 

I'm always gonna find my way back home 

I'm always gonna find my way back home 

No matter how far I’m gone 

No matter how far I’m gone 

No matter where I might stay 

No matter where I might stay 

I met a woman, she always lived in the same place 

And she said home is where you’re born and raised 

And I met a man, he sat looking out to the sea 

And he said home is where you want to be 

I met a girl in some downtown bar 

to get a place of my own 

No matter how far I’m gone 

No matter how far I’m gone 

No matter where I might stay 

No matter where I might stay
