For the last 50 years, a lot of smart, well-resourced people -- some of you, no doubt -- have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the United States.

So they hatched a plan.

They started a cleaning business.

Two of them would clean the office or house and one of them would watch the kids.

They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids.

(Laughs) It's awesome, right? 

And they split the money three ways.

But it made a difference for their families.

And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening.

Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and Brianna was devastated.

So she created a support group for parents like her.

The first meeting was her and two other people.

But word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together.

At eight, I was a latchkey kid.

If I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie. 

Cherry.

Not as good as a buttermilk drop. 

We were poor when I was a kid.

But most people work hard.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Not directing -- not even empowering -- but just fueling their initiative. 

I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people.

Listen to Reverend King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail."

We are magic.

Thank you. 

Thank you.
