What do you do when you have a headache?

You swallow an aspirin.

But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first. 

However, upon discontinuation of therapy, the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. 

If they can be used for dentistry, for diabetic wound-healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imaginable, including transporting drugs into cells. 

Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.

Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. 

Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device.

Using the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision in the site of infection.

Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection.

Well, this might not seem like much right now.

This is every HIV researcher's dream -- in our case, a cure lead by lasers. 

Thank you.
