It's a seductive place, isn't it? 

I don't live there.

(Laughter) But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.

What is a Whitopia?

Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia. 

First stop, St. George -- a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.

In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate.

And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day.

I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist.

I went to zoning board meetings, I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs.

I went to poker nights.

In St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities.

There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me.

I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor. 

(Laughter) (Applause)

Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia.

When I went on my journey, I had barely ever held a golf club.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Golf helps people bond.

Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses.

One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members. 

I also went fishing.

(Laughter) Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use.

I also played poker every weekend.

It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.

My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs.

Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. 

I'm a gung ho entertainer.

But it wasn't all fun.

Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia.

It was a real-time preview, and so it has become. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.

I golfed with retired LAPD cops.

Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture.

In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations.

So what's a resident to do to fit in?

I hit the gun club.

That's when he got nervous.

I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been. 

What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. 

In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad.

And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people.

In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars. 

About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group.

America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations, happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit.

So I decided to crash it.

(Laughter) I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Next stop was Georgia.

In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta.

In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God.

(Laughter) The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus.

I was active in the youth ministry.

And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston.

That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

But what does it all mean?

Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals, social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools.

Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism -- privatized places, privatized people, privatized things.

And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. 

Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture.

The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind.

Interpersonal race relations -- how we treat each other as human beings -- are vastly better than in my parents' generation.

Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago?

What a journey that would have been.

(Laughter) And yet, some things haven't changed.

America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970. 

It's a devastating irony, how we have gone forward as individuals, and backwards as communities. 

One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying: "One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50 black men is a ghetto."

One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.

By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority.

As such, will there be more Whitopias?

In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. 

(Laughter) I didn't expect to learn so much about myself.

I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia -- or a Blacktopia, for that matter.

I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get.

(Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. 

(Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. 

(Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. 

(Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. 

Thank you.
