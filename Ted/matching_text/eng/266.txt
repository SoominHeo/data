I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library. 

It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.

For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.

So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful. 

So how do we do that?

We need to know what makes these organizations tick.

We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.

Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.

It is all part of the same organization.

And armed groups today are complex organizations.

Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

They set up complex communication machines -- radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and social media strategies.

Now, these activities are keys.

They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand. 

They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.

Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.

So in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability.

To achieve these objectives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.
