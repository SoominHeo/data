Well, why is that?

What is that keeps us coming back to insects?

They meet, they mate, they fight, they break up.

And they do so with what looks like love or animosity.

There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body.

So, no, that's not the point.

So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive, and females are passive and coy. 

You can see two katydids mating in these photos.

So, it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules.

Even more generally though, males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects.

In the social insects -- the bees and wasps and ants -- the individuals that you see every day -- the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl, the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower -- all of those are always female.

People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia.

Aristotle tried to get involved as well.

And you know, even today, my students, for instance, call every animal they see, including insects, a male.

But when we do that, we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like.

And we can also miss out on the way natural, living things, including people, can vary.

Now, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes.

They speculate about the supernatural, maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us.

The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal.
