Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another.

So I'm on a mission to change that.

I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences. 

Even worse, as I communicated online with my family back home, I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace.

So take, for example, the smile and the smirk.

(Laughter) So the smile is positive, a smirk is often negative.

Sometimes a smirk can make you become famous.

But seriously, it's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions. 

(Laughter) Cloe's going to be our volunteer today. 

The question is, can it recognize her expression?

It's growing every day.

So what have we learned to date?

Gender.

And I invite you all to be part of the conversation.

The more people who know about this technology, the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used.

So as more and more of our lives become digital, we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions.

So I want those devices that have separated us to bring us back together.
