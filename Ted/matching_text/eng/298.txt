So if I told you that this was the face of pure joy, would you call me crazy?

I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph. 

It was the coldest I've ever been.

But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes, and cheeks flushed red, I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy. 

(Laughter) 

Chris Burkard: So, surf photographer, right?

I don't even know if it's a real job title, to be honest.

Sweating it out, shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations.

But there was just this one problem.

You see, the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations, the less gratifying it seemed to be.

I set out seeking adventure, and what I was finding was only routine.

(Laughter) Helicopters really scare me, by the way. 

But to me, that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches. 

Now, it wasn't until I traveled to Norway -- (Laughter) -- that I really learned to appreciate the cold.

We were in this tiny, remote fjord, just inside the Arctic Circle.

It had a greater population of sheep than people, so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found.

I was in the water taking pictures of surfers, and it started to snow.

Actually, I was totally freaking out -- (Laughter) -- and I was borderline hypothermic, and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water.

And I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what, but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time. 

And I realized, all this shivering had actually taught me something: In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.

So I look back at this photograph.

Thank you so much.
