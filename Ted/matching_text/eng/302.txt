Chris Anderson: So I guess what we're going to do is we're going to talk about your life, and using some pictures that you shared with me.

And I think we should start right here with this one.

Okay, now who is this? 

Martine Rothblatt: This is me with our oldest son Eli.

He was about age five.

This is taken in Nigeria right after having taken the Washington, D.C. bar exam. 

Before I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

MR: Correct. 

CA: And about a year after this picture, you married a beautiful woman.

Tell us about that. 

CA: So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time.

It was a huge commercial success, but soon after this, in the early 1990s, there was this big transition in your life and you became Martine. 

And each of them had a different take on this.

My youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing.

MR: My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world, and actually, seven billion unique ways to express one's gender.

And while people may have the genitals of a male or a female, the genitals don't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

MR: Correct.

CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.

And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened. 

CA: So how did you respond to that? 

The head of pediatric cardiology told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant, but not to hold out any hope, because there are very few lungs available, especially for children.

I read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension.

So we started a nonprofit foundation.

I wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research.

I became an expert on the condition -- doctors said to me, Martine, we really appreciate all the funding you've provided us, but we are not going to be able to find a cure in time to save your daughter.

However, there is a medicine that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company that could halt the progression of the disease, but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.

CA: So how on earth did you get access to this drug? 

CA: And yet, a year or two later, you were there with a medicine that worked for Jenesis. 

MR: Chris, the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis is not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today, but produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue. 

So you took this company public, right?

And made an absolute fortune.

And how much have you paid Glaxo, by the way, after that 25,000? 

She's alive, healthy today at 30.

You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.

The most amazing thing about Jenesis is that while she could do anything with her life, and believe me, if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease, I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again.

CA: But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate.

It's actually not rocket science.

It's straightforward engineering away one gene after another.

MR: What this graph means, and it comes from Ray Kurzweil, is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware, firmware and software, has been advancing along a curve such that by the 2020s, as we saw in earlier presentations today, there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind. 

CA: And so that being so, you're actually getting ready for this world by believing that we will soon be able to, what, actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever?

How do you describe that? 

MR: This is a robot version of my beloved spouse, Bina.

And we call her Bina 48.

She was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.

If anything, I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities that are being undertaken by the greatest companies in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.

Thank you, thank you.

Come and join Martine here.

I mean, look, when you got married, if someone had told you that, in a few years time, the man you were marrying would become a woman, and a few years after that, you would become a robot -- (Laughter) -- how has this gone?

We're cryonicists as well, and we want to wake up together.
