These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley, California.

So as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like.

So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. 

I'm going to show you the first 21 days of a bee's life condensed into 60 seconds. 

Then, their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae.

Here's that same pupation process, and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells.

Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes.

This is one of those alternatives.

Now, the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites, so they set out to breed a line of mite-resistant bees.

And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees, and the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years.

So when people talk about saving bees, my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees, and in order to design new solutions, we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.

In other words, we have to understand bees up close. 

Thank you.
