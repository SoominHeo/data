In June of 1998, Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head, North Carolina for France. 

That's her boat, the American Pearl.

Tori and her friends built it by hand, and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.

This would be her route: over 3,600 miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean. 

This is her 21st day at sea.

(Video) TMM: And I want to show you my little friends. 

After two weeks with no human contact, Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio. 

That'd be coming east-northeast also. 

DL: She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point. 

(Video) TMM: So weather report says nothing dramatic is going to happen soon. 

(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.

There's a very strong wind from the east now.

Some of them were pitchpole capsizes, flipping her end over end, and rowing became impossible. 

Two capsizes.

Last capsize, I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back.

I've had about six capsizes now.

The last one was a pitchpole.

It's so far underwater right now, the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin.

It's about 10 a.m.

I took my body 

burned in the moonlight, 

making me smile. 

I walked to a party 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Just pay attention, 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

rock me and throw me, 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Just pay attention, 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

Ah, listen, dear heart. 

She starts hanging out with her friends again.

Tori rebuilt the American Pearl, and in December of 1999, she did it. 

Thank you.
