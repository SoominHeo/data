You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.

This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health, and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. 

Now, the diagram that you see here, I know it looks like some kind of sports play, but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed.

The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair.

Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off.

This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova, because it looks like an exploding star. 

Now, besides programming these beautiful patterns, I wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do?

And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer.

One of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors.

We started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit, and found that when orally delivered to mice, these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors.

Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. 

Thank you.
