And one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions.

And that's a shame because one out of five of us, that's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder.

And there are zero cures for these diseases.

And so we did just that.

You guys want to see some? 

(Applause) Sam Kelly: Sam.

They're sending electrical messages back and forth, and chemical messages.

Let's take a look at it as well.

So your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles.

Now I want you to relax your hand.

Sam, you're with me?

So now, are you ready, Miguel?

(Laughter) So relax.

So hit it again.

(Laughter) Oh, perfect, perfect.

So relax, do it again. 

What happens?

Ah, nothing.

Why not?

Because the brain has to do it.

Thank you guys for being such a good sport.

We're going to bring on the neuro-revolution. 

Thank you. 

(Applause)
