These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.

A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.

It's a difficult place to work in.

These fossils were deposited in a river system.

We now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from the T. rex.

But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.

We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail.

It's a dinosaur like no other.
