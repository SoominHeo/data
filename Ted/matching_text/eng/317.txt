My childhood was abound with questions like this.

Their parenting always sought to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world, while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable. 

In his most famous book, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed," he states, "No one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so."

But within 10 minutes, my father came outside, grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip.

Before I could say anything, tell him how foolish he had made me look in front of my friends, he derided me for being so naive.

So that we could be kids, not casket or concrete.

And it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it's simply because they wanted to keep us alive. 

All of my black friends were raised with the same message, the talk, given to us when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground, when people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared. 

But what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child?

That the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath, that you cannot simply be curious, that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake, that someone's implicit bias might be the reason you don't wake up in the morning. 

Because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet, but for flying kites and jumping rope, and laughing until our stomachs burst.

We had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class, and not just to signal surrender, and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we aren't worthy of this world.

Thank you.
