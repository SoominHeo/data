And the farthest galaxy is a trillion, trillion kilometers away. 

As an astrophysicist, I have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects in our universe.

The objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my career are supermassive, hyperactive black holes.

These two characteristics, with a few others, make them quasars.

These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called blazars, or blazing quasars.

What makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's most efficient particle accelerators, transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy. 

Here, I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar.

The dinner plate by which material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc, shown here in blue.

Although the blazar system is rare, the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk, and then flings some of it out via a jet, is more common.

We'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context. 

Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out, one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest-energy jet emission comes from.

I simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year, to better localize these gamma ray blobs.

My research shows that in some instances, these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought. 

This all started as a love story.

And it still is.

This love transformed me from a curious, stargazing young girl to a professional astrophysicist, hot on the heels of celestial discovery.

Who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth.

Then again, when do we ever know where love's first flutter will truly take us. 

Thank you.
