You know the story, right?

The tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money.

People may think it's an overnight success, but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that, I took life and education seriously.

Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. 

Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you.

Constantly, people want to help out, right?

But okay is never okay.

When you're growing towards a peak, you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak.

Maybe if I did little, a couple hundred thousand people would read it, and that's great already.

Yes, the market may be bad.

You need to get your dreams and make them happen.

And no one achieved their goals alone.

But if you didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's.

Be responsible for your dreams. 

Yes, you should enjoy the goals themselves, but people think that you have dreams, and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams, it's a magical place where happiness will be all around.

But achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not.

Sometimes you will trip.

Thank you.
