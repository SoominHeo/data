People back home call me a heckler, a troublemaker, an irritant, a rebel, an activist, the voice of the people.

But that wasn't always me. 

Like every other human being, I avoided trouble.

In my childhood, they taught me silence.

This was reinforced by the political climate of the time.

(Laughter) Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich.

We had a president, Moi, who was a dictator.

He ruled the country with an iron fist, and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested, tortured, jailed or even killed.

That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.

Being a coward was not an insult.

Being a coward was a compliment.

We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother.

What that meant: that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive. 

We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it. 

And when the president stood up to speak, I found myself on my feet shouting at the president, telling him to remember the post-election violence victims, to stop the corruption.

Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

It was a story to them. 

And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it.

Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago, now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me.

So that was my story.

So we package our activism and we package our message in art.
