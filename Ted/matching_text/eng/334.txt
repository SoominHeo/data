I'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture. 

We tended to die at home, in our own beds, looked after by family, although that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care. 

And then in the 20th century a lot of things changed.

During that period, we'll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes. 

Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.

But the surprising thing is, it wasn't always like this. 

Somehow, we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital. 

People are actually really open to changing things if they're given the chance to talk about them.
