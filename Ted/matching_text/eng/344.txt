There's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them.

Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18, we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people. 

Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person, not cause him or her to become more angry, frustrated, and feel more hopeless.

Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people, they pretty much reenter society with nothing.

And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating. 

But it all starts with the C.O.s.

The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s.

They play the little high school kid games with each other.

I have no wins.

All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately.

Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes, we can handle it in that manner.

This is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept.

In some instances, we're in it together with the C.O.s.

So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there?

A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming.

When I was on Rikers Island, the huge thing was solitary confinement.

Solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally, physically and emotionally.

And aside from that, I wrote music and short stories.

How about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music?

Just a thought. 

Ever since that day, that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change.

Growing up, I was always a good, smart kid.

Thank you.
