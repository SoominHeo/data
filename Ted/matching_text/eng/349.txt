This is in 2010 in Uganda, working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent.

That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control. 

Eventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.

But that's not always the case.

Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few, and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many. 

In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps, there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.

Is their experience changed? 

And so the question that I ask myself is, what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency? 

Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia: I recently went to the public library there, and they are facing an existential crisis.

So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud-based library, what used to be considered such a basic part of education?

How do they stay competitive? 

So that's the common thread that connects these examples, the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make.

As engineers, as technologists, we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy.

We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing.

This needs to change.

Thank you.
