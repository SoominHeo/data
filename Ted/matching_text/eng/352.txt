I am multidisciplinary. 

As a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year, and as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet.

And recently, I've actually been combining both.

But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission. 

So doing this mission, I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space.

We will venture into outer space, and we will start inhabiting outer space.

I have no doubt about it.

So I came up with a new art project called Seeker.

That's the core of the project. 

Now, one important thing: This is not a dystopian project.

It's a little bit like termites, really.

It was built with a team of almost 50 people.

And that's another crucial part of the project.

It's an evolving artwork, evolving architecture.

Now, when we're thinking about starships, we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge.

We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end, and test what we build.

And, of course, obviously, this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us. 

First of all, it's really considered a Mars analogue.

And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars.

It's now home to ALMA, the large telescope that's being developed there.
