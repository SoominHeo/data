I'm an artist and I cut books.

I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books, but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it, and wonder what was happening, wonder why, and think about the material of the book.

So I'm interested in the texture, but I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books. 

So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. 

I'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format, and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural. 

Or something like this can become a piece like this.

Or something like this, which who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio, will become a piece like this. 

So I think of the book as a body, and I think of the book as a technology.

So I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me, and it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future.
