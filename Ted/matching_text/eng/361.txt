The reason that Lofa County is so important is because about five months ago, when the epidemic was just starting to escalate, Lofa County was right at the center, the epicenter of this epidemic.

And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you.

So he sat down with the local chiefs, and he listened.

We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks.

But there are similar stories from the other countries as well.

The challenge now, of course, is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries, and that is a huge challenge.

Because when you've been at something for this long, on this scale, two other big threats come in to join the virus.

Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa.

The people of these countries, the leaders of these countries, they are not complacent.

They want to drive Ebola to zero in their countries.

And these people, yes, they're tired, but they are not fatigued.

Because finishing Ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus, and beginning to hunt it. 

Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.

Thank you.
