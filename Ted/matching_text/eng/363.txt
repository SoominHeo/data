(Laughter) But being a part of this community, we knew how welcoming this space was.

What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America.

There were even these two NFL athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so. 

My codirector, Omar, and I were at a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the film.

The movie is called "These Birds Walk," and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family.

The agenda behind our cinematic immersion was only empathy, an emotion that's largely deficient from films that come from our region of the world. 

And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat, something felt off. 

For those that don't know, halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines.

Unfortunately, the majority of halal meat in America doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for.

There's really nothing like it in America.

The unbelievable part is actually that 90 percent of our in-store customers are not even Muslim.

So all these disparate projects -- (Laughter) -- are the result of a restlessness.

We must fight with an inventive approach.

But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance.

It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.

They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected.
