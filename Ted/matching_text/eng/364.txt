Hi.

I was born in Sierra Leone.

She was ethnic-looking, very old.

I struggled and tried to get her off me, but I couldn't.

We went to Senegal, then France, and then Singapore.

We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.

(Laughter) Never found evidence of it to this day.

Six hundred white kids, and I was the only black child there.

There were no Asians, no indigenous.

Type I is when they cut off the hood.

Before all of this, I pretty much had amnesia.

Yes, I was aware something bad happened to me, but I had no recollection of what had happened.

Didn't happen. 

(Laughter) Just saying, it wasn't me.

She didn't get it.

We came from two different worlds.

I was an African Australian girl.

I lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric.

And there came then the big news.

I'm still waiting for an apology, by the way. 

Then I got married.

A couple of months ago, I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man.

Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives.

FGM is child abuse.

What are you going to do?

There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM.

Culture should not be a defense for child abuse.

Thank you.
