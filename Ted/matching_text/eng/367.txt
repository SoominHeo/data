It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes.

But after the food goes through the digestive system, when it is thrown out as crap, it is no longer fashionable to speak about it.

It is rather revolting. 

And when we look at the reason for poor quality water, you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste. 

In India, it is unfortunately only the women who carry water.

So for all domestic needs, women have to carry water.

So that is a pitiable state of affairs. 

So we, together with a lot of villages, we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation.

And we came together and formed a project called MANTRA.

They decide to build a toilet and a shower room.

The pity is that our cities, like New Delhi and Bombay, do not have a 24-hour water supply.

But in these villages, we want to have it. 

This, combined with a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic, is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink.

We are fighting against this.

We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries.

And even in sanitation, they should not be humiliated.

Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste.

We use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste.

From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.

And when it is full, it is blocked and it can go to the next.

And that is the end product.

We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program.

And boys, about 30 percent.

Because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders, now their ability to earn has increased 300 to 400 percent. 

And I hope it continues to move ahead. 

For India and such developing countries, armies and armaments, software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets. 

Thank you.
