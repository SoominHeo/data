But my brother, who is older than me, was arrested when he was 18, taken to prison on charges of throwing stones.

But that changed when I was 18.

I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job, and going to study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers.

But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger, of hatred and of ignorance that separates us.

I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me.

What really matters is how I deal with it.

And therefore, I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people. 

I do so through many ways.

And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.

It's the best meal ever.

And we'll eat together.

Then we had a joint band, Israeli and Palestinian musicians, and we did some belly-dancing.

If you don't know any, I'll teach you later.

But when we left, both sides, they were crying because they did not want to leave.

Three years later, those relationships still exist. 

This is not disaster tourism.

This is the future of travel, and I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel.

We're doing it all over the world now, from Ireland to Iran to Turkey, and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world.
