Today, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered.

It was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction.

So in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign.

Unfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful.

So really, having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. 

Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals.

So clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling, both horizontally and vertically, through the oceans. 

But what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead.

Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land. 

We need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today.

Amongst other things, we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container ships when they're in their feeding areas, and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean.

We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages, so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures.
