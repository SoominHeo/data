Catadores provide a heavy, honest and essential work that benefits the entire population.

Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent of all the waste that's actually recycled. 

They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags, shopping carts, bicycles and carroças.

And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes. 

I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social, environmental and political in nature.

In 2007, I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças, as a new urban support for my message.

So, the thing is, I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since.

I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide.

Thank you.

Then, finally, painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge, amazing mobile art exhibition. 

Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.

Try to see the world as one, without boundaries or frontiers.

Believe it or not, there are over 20 million catadores worldwide.
