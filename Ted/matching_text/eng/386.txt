Today, I want to show you a new kind of map.

This is not a geographic map.

Let's take a look at San Francisco.

You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco.

You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community.

And so it leads to things like this.

Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.

I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio, and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything's really kind of mixed up.

It's a very heterogenous city in a way that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.

Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here.

Other boy bands, country singers, gospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy, and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes.

How cool is that?

And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here.

So we have all this data.

So what can we do with it?

Well, I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct.

Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. 

The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity.

We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here -- only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity.

So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems, we need to start to think about diversity in a new way. 

Thank you.
