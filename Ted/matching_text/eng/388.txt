Thank you.

I have only got 18 minutes to explain something that lasts for hours and days, so I'd better get started.

Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post. 

Norwegians, more than a million of them according to the ratings, loved it.

A new kind of reality TV show was born, and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement.

We have to go back to 2009, when one of my colleagues got a great idea.

Where do you get your ideas?

In the lunchroom.

So he said, why don't we make a radio program marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in 1940.

So one of us came up with a train.

We had four cameras, three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature.

Some talking to the guests, some information.

Four hundred and thirty-six minute by minute on a Friday night, and during that first night, the first Twitter message came: Why be a chicken?

So just a week after the Bergen Railway, we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show. 

(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: Run it up and down.

This is Norway's most important drill right now.

We have made 18 hours of live salmon fishing.

This is so completely different to other TV programming.

This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks.

And of course this is a lot of planning, this is a lot of logistics.

You don't plan what's going to happen.

You have to just take your cameras with you.

It's like a sports event.

You rig them and you see what's happening.

We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen. 

And where is that cow going?

That's Slow TV. 

Thank you.
