When I arrived in Kiev, on February 1 this year, Independence Square was under siege, surrounded by police loyal to the government.

In order to tell the individual human stories here, I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media.

What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history.

I worked slowly, using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter.

The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue.

The following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.

Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead.

They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers.

Sadness enveloped Maidan.

It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing.

I hadn't heard that before. 

I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture.

Most women cried when I photographed them.

It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other.

Men fight most wars and women mourn them.

If the men showed the ideal of the warrior, then the women showed the implications of such violence. 

But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning.

Today, the death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.
