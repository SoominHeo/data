(Laughter) The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar.

(Laughter) It's an involuntary reflex — ding, click, bing — it's in your calendar, "Gotta go, I'm already late for a meeting."

(Laughter)

(Laughter) And we're miserable not because the other guy can't run a good meeting, it's because of MAS, our Mindless Accept Syndrome, which is a self-inflicted wound.

Actually, I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic.

Let me tell you why.

It goes on for about five minutes, and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings.

(Laughter) 

Sound familiar?

Yeah, it sounds familiar to me, too.

It's close to about a million right now.

(Laughter) Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"

(Laughter) Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"

(Laughter) Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"

(Laughter) Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"

It's right next to the accept button.

Or the maybe button, or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately.

Then, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting.

Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with.
