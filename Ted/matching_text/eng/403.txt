Becoming a doctor was my dream.

Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.

Well, eventually I learned enough English, and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. 

For her to tell me that something was the matter, I knew something had to be really wrong.

My mother was brave, though, and she had hope.

She went through surgery and radiation, and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book.

It made her scared and it made her doubt.

When it comes to medicine, having that trust is a must, and when that trust is gone, then all that's left is fear. 

I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right?

We put on our white coats and we hide behind them.

Of course, the more we hide, the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding.

The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care.

We don't just have a fear of sickness, we have a sickness of fear. 

Can we overcome the sickness of fear?

Let me ask you differently: If hiding isn't the answer, what if we did the opposite?

What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients? 

So my two medical students, Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns, literally took their research to the streets.

Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine.

Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor.

Incentives matter.

We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. 

Within a month, my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired.

When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals, take off our white coats, and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about, that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear.
