But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. 

Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years ago, we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas.

Now, we learned that favelas are informal communities.

So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands, without a master plan and like a giant work in progress.

Where we're from, in Holland, everything is planned.

But somehow the idea stuck. 

JK: We had a friend.

He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.

His name was Nanko, and he also liked the idea.

So he introduced us to the right people, and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.

Also the same color as the prison cell.

So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river, together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor, who lived nearby.

Unfortunately, during that time, another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs.

JK: We still had this idea of the hill, though. 

But we figured that maybe, during this process, all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. 

So we immediately said yes.

JK: So now we had painted a whole street.

How about we do this whole hill now?

How many square meters is that?

And maybe it's a mistake to think like that.

DU: So what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea, which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art.

Together with them, we decided where to start.

We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro, and houses are being plastered as we speak.

And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next.

DU: So while this is happening, we are bringing this idea all over the world.

DU: Thank you.
