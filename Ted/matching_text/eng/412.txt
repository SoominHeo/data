Some years ago, it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver.

When they arrived, they would all take off their skins.

Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur, and salmon her scales, and then, they would dance.

Embarrassed, the animals fled, and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way. 

The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one, has been a powerful inspiration to me.

I like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scales.

I want to get under the skin.

No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye. 

You just have to learn how to look past their disguise. 

As a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing.

When I use my camera, I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. 

As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life.

As citizens of a planet in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.

But as humans with hearts, we can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave. 

Let's find a way to join the dance. 

Thank you.
