Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel.

I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again playing music by this same composer.

Let's take a look.

and you'd be really welcome.

Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. 

Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. 

It started a couple of years ago.

So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.

It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music, and I had not felt that in a long time.

It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.

The first piece that I played through started like this. 

And I turned the page and what came next was this. 

And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions.

And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively. 

And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that.

The complexity of the music does become an issue, and actually the opinions of others — parents, friends, media — they start to count.

But the young ones, they don't question their own opinion.

(Applause)
