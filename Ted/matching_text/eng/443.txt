Good afternoon.

My name is Uldus.

I am a photo-based artist from Russia.

Today, I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.

I focus on balancing meaningful message, aesthetic, beauty, composition, some irony, and artifacts. 

Today, I'm going to tell you about my project, which is named Desperate Romantics.

They're my artifacts, or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid-19th century.

I took the painting and gifted new, contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia, capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story. 

This boy is a professional dancer, only 12 years old, but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality, trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality.

Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.

Sometimes, in my project, I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it.

Through the artifacts, I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation.

Interesting fact about marriage in Russia, that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls are already ready, and dream to get married.

We're taught from childhood, successful marriage means successful life, so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband. 

And what about me?

I'm 27 years old.

For Russian society, I'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married.
