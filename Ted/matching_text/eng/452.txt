This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.

They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium.

It's microinsurance. 

For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa, the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up.

So instead, we rely on technology and data.

These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya.

That, and those clouds, were the onset of the rains this year.

We set ourselves a modest target of 500 farmers insured after our first season.

After a couple of months' intense marketing, we had signed up the grand total of 185 farmers.

I was disappointed and confounded.

That's an attractive proposition.

For insurance, the farmer needs to trust the insurance company, and needs to advance the insurance company money.

It's a very different value proposition.

Most of the organizations, however, were limiting their growth in agriculture.

They couldn't take on this kind of risk.

These organizations became our customers, and when combining credit and insurance, interesting things can happen.

Let me tell you one more story. 

So they took out loans and planted.

Could you give us the money now?

One of the first — (Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there! 

One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi.

Insurance secured his harvest that season, and I believe that today, we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny.

No more years of the cup.

Thank you.
