We are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects.

The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them.

Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. 

And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.

During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations.

The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide.

Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group.

There are always traces â€” no such thing as a perfect crime.

Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified.

These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims, but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials.

Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects, they become orphans of the narrative.

As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.

I like to move beyond raising awareness.

And in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened.

Once all the missing persons are identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain.

Thank you very much.
