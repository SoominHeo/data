And she started telling me about her grandkids, and that blew my mind.

And I would notice as I would visit schools, the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way.

But it meant the most to Jeannie.

That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year. 

And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray.

There is Ms. Brenda in California, who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss.

And kids made the most amazing projects.

They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers.

And of course what she does is important.

What they all do is important.
