TED is 30.

The world wide web is celebrating this month its 25th anniversary.

So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.

I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project.

I wrote the code.

I was I suppose the first user.

And in fact, a few years later in 2000, five percent of the world population were using the world wide web.

And now here we are in 2014, and 40 percent of the world are using the world wide web, and counting.

Obviously it's increasing. 

I want you to think about both sides of that.

Commerce has been almost universally affected.

Government, not universally affected, but very affected, and on a good day, lots of open data, lots of e-government, so lots of things which are visible happening on the web. 

So we cannot assume that part of the web, part of the deal with the web, is when I use the web, it's just a transparent, neutral medium.

We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech.

It doesn't matter who we are.

And we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble, the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like.

So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have. 

What sort of web do you want?

I want a web which has got, for example, is a really good basis for democracy.

I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data, clinical data is available to scientists to do research.

I want a web where the other 60 percent get on board as fast as possible.

You have your list.

I want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want.

You can go to webat25.org and find some links.

What would be on your list for that Magna Carta?

Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web.

Let's do that this year.
