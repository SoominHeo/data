Take a look at this drawing.

Can you tell what it is?

So we start outside of the cell.

Now we're looking inside.

And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes. 

The payoffs can be huge, though.

Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.

Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.

The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.

I believe that animation can change biology.

It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students.

From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis.

We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations.

We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today.

We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. 

Thank you.
