I was born in Taiwan.

I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, and I like going to night markets.

I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play.

In these early installations, I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags, and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house.

I would take things like highlighter pen, mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy.

I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.

I also like to modify household appliances.

I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, so I built this device using bicycle helmets, some lightbulbs and television sets.

It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes.

This sculpture has four eyes.

Each eye is controlling a different device.

This eye is turning itself around in a television.

And these two eyes are activating glowing water.

Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions around the world. 

I love science and biology.

I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens.

From afar, they look alien-like, but when you look closer, they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers. 

I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous.
