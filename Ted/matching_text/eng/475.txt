That night, at midnight, a magnitude 9 earthquake hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.

My wife and family were in Japan, and as the news started to come in, I was panicking.

And the people on TV weren't telling us anything that we wanted to hear.

I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor, what was going on with the radiation, whether my family was in danger. 

Three years later, we have 16 million data points, we have designed our own Geiger counters that you can download the designs and plug it into the network.

We have an app that shows you most of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world.

We are arguably one of the most successful citizen science projects in the world, and we have created the largest open dataset of radiation measurements. 

And the interesting thing here is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.

It turns out it's happening in other things, too.

Let me give you some examples. 

So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.

We do all kinds of things.

Doesn't this sound like a software thing?

This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering, pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies. 

(Applause) 

So I don't like the word "futurist."

Thank you. 

(Applause)
