To which I usually respond, I do computer music. 

Which is true.

That's usually followed by a second thought, which is, whatever it is that I'm doing, I love it.

And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition, maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff I've been working on. 

And the first thing, I think, in our story is going to be something called ChucK.

And instead of telling you more about it, I'm just going to give you a demo.

If you've never written a line of code before in your life, do not worry.

I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this. 

And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.

It's good practice.

And when we do this — (Tones) — that's going to go on for a while.

And I can't really empirically prove that to you, but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.

Next, I'm going to replace this 220 by math.random2f.

I'm going to generate a random number between 30 and 1,000 and send that to the frequency of me.

At this point, we've reached something that I would like to think of as the canonical computer music.

This is, to me, the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they're thinking really hard.

It's this sound, it's like, the square root of five million. 

So is this computer music?

Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops, humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.

Like, if I were to play a violin here, the sound would naturally not come out of the P.A.

So these speakers are meant to emulate that.

In fact, I'm going to show you how we actually built them.

The first step is to go to IKEA and buy a salad bowl.

This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.

Add people, add laptops, you have a laptop orchestra. 

And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?

And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing.

This thing I have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming controller called a Gametrak.

It was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing.

So let me see if this will work. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) It's like a hovering car. 

(Music) It's like a hovering car. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

So it's a slightly different interaction. 

The fourth one is a drone. 

(Drum) (Laughter) So there we go, so that's one of many instruments in the Laptop Orchestra. 

(Applause) 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

And when you put that together, you get something that sounds like this. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Okay, and so, I think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra, and I think from the curiosity of wondering, what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people, plus then a healthy bout of insanity — put those three things together — led to me actually co-founding a startup company in 2008 called Smule. 

And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.

(Music) And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer, so you can get — (Music) All right.

And here, you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on. 

(Applause) 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

I don't think that's really happening that much anymore.

You know, this is before radio, before recording.

I'm not sure why that would be.

Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.

And while listening to music is wonderful, there's a special joy to making music that's all its own.

Now, if that's one goal, the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don't perhaps yet have names for that's enabled by technology, but ultimately might change the way that humans make music.

(Music) 

(Music) 

The first thought is that, hey, you know there's somebody somewhere out there playing some music, and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords. 

And this is what it sounds like when there's 1,000 people.

This is 1,000 voices. 

Is this computer music? 

(Applause) 

(Applause)
