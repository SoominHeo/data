But that wasn't the end of my story.

No one told me that I would live in fear, that I would become paranoid, or that I would react hyper-violently to being shot.

As I sat in my cold cell, I felt helpless, unloved and abandoned.

One day, I was pacing my cell, when an officer came and delivered mail.

They made me examine things about my life that I hadn't considered.

The final thing was writing.

It was the first time in my life that I ever felt open to forgiving myself. 

So I made it up in my mind that if I was ever released from prison that I would do everything in my power to help change that. 

For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet, social media, cars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider."

See, when I went to prison, our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them.

The third thing was atoning.

My wish today is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration, that we will do away with the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality, because it's proven it doesn't work. 

Thank you.
