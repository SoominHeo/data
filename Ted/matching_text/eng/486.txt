The first dog is the first to go, and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner, and the title is "A Dog on His Master."

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

And our next dog speaks in something called the revenant, which means a spirit that comes back to visit you. 

I resented the way you moved, your lack of animal grace, the way you would sit in a chair to eat, a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.

Thank you. 

Thank you.
