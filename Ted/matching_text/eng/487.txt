Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells 

I don't even think of it 

I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand” 

And when I’m on the block I switch it up just because I can 

Because I’m “articulate” 

But who controls articulation? 

Subject to indefinite transformation 

Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English 

But I’m here to tell you that even “articulate” Americans sound foolish to the British 

Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool 

But I’m here to tell you that even our language has rules 

Never does the word "madd" go before a present participle 

From every suburbia, and every hood 

Of this world saying “it is good" 

So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech 

That I’m too ignorant to teach 

‘Cause I speak three tongues 

Home, school and friends 

I’m a tri-lingual orator 

Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now 

Then switch it up so I don’t bore later 

While I use the other one in the classroom 

I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom 

I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen 

By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season 

Is because mines was raped away along with my history 

I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us 

That our current state is not a mystery 

I’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad 

So unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad 

As much as has been raped away from our people 

As anything less than equal 

Let there be no confusion 

Let there be no hesitation 

This is not a promotion of ignorance 

This is a linguistic celebration 

That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application 

I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know 

And of course …“Hello” 

Because I’m “articulate” 

Thank you.
