I had done some activism in college, so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing.

Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence. 

They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.

And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular, so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word, eco-terrorist, to shift how we view them.

They just made it up. 

Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House.

The rest were outside at a new memorial.

They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment. 

But right now, companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists.

Today, in multiple countries, corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms.

But apparently, even exposing stuff like that is a threat.

Through the Freedom of Information Act, I learned that the counter-terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one.

They even included this nice little write-up of my book.

They described it as "compelling and well-written."

(Applause) Blurb on the next book, right? 

Our best weapon is sunlight. 

Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.

Over and over throughout history, people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent.

It's time we strike a new note. 

Thank you. 

(Applause)
