The more techniques you know, the more things you can make, and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love. 

That said, poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things.

For example, we are all going to die.

Poetry can help us live with that.

So here's one of the first poems I memorized.

It could address a child or an adult. 

Now, this poem has appealed to science fiction writers.

It plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives.

A few years on Earth become one speech, one breath.

It would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear. 

Now, this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult.

It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before. 

Now, I found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.

Oleander is poisonous.

We let guys tell women what to do.

Now, how do I know that I'm right about this somewhat confusing poem?

Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's, but a little younger than A. E. Housman's. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

Run away. 

"Brave" has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense, courage.

That is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza, where run away has become a refrain.

This person might want to run away too, but fortified by the sun's example, he might just rise.

Stevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation" for the end.

Unlike the sun, human beings think.

We meditate on past and future, life and death, above and below.

And it can make us afraid. 

Some poems even tell you that that is what they can do.

Thanks.
