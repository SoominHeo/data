And so, many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders, forage for berries, and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road. 

In most of our minds, the vagabond is a creature from the past.

Like their predecessors, today's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the United States.

By day, they hop freight trains, stick out their thumbs, and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms.

By night, they sleep beneath the stars, huddled together with their packs of dogs, cats and pet rats between their bodies. 

Many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this, under the thumb of discriminatory laws, eating out of trash cans, sleeping under bridges, picking up seasonal jobs here and there.

Thank you.
