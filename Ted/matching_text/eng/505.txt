What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy?

And what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

Now how do we get to augmented reality?

So let's pull up some video. 

We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington. 

But this is not yet augmented reality.

In 1965, the Baltimore Colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker.

They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.

Other teams followed suit.

More people watched the game because it was more exciting.

It was faster. 

More people watched games because it was faster.

It was more entertaining. 

No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.

You just go out and react.

Losing games gets you fired as a coach.

They don't want that. 

But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook.

You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers, technology that's being worked on right now.

You take all that information, and you stream it to your players.

The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.

The bad ones have information overload.

What would that look like on the field?

Well, imagine you're the quarterback.

You take the snap and you drop back.

You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.

You step up into the pocket.

The ball comes off track.

You don't know where it's going to land.

However, on the receiver's visor, he sees a patch of grass light up, and he knows to readjust.

Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him every step of the way, watching from every perspective. 

Fans want to be on the field.

They want to be their favorite player.

Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality is coming.

The questions we ask, the choices we make, and the challenges we face are, as always, up to us. 

Thank you.
