In the summer of 2010, there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the Pentagon.

Why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person? 

Our main effort was inside Iraq, and our specified mission was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.

It was the idea that information was the lifeblood and it was what would protect and keep people safe.

And in a tightly coupled world, that's very hard to predict.

It's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn't.

(Laughter) I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."

But what we found is we had to change.

It was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its DNA. 

We captured the personnel records for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into Iraq.

And when we got the personnel records, typically, we would have hidden these, shared them with a few intelligence agencies, and then try to operate with them.

(Laughter) 

The fact that I know something has zero value if I'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it.

(Laughter) But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks, because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share. 

Thank you. 

I just wonder, do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty? 

Stanley McChrystal: I think that Rick said something very important.

We, most people, don't know all the facts.

I think there are two parts of this.

Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand.
