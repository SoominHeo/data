Let me introduce you to something I've been working on.

It's what the Victorian illusionists would have described as a mechanical marvel, an automaton, a thinking machine.

EDI, EDI. 

Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.

They were not intelligent.

They were illusions, a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.

EDI is different.

EDI is real. 

EDI: I have two seven-axis arms â€” 

MT: We love robots. 

We build them so they look like us, behave like us, and think like us.

When someone hands an object to you, you can read intention in their eyes, their face, their body language.

That's not true of the robot.

Now, this goes both ways. 

MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions. 

EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable, not to mention irrational.

I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next, you know, but it scares me. 

Accidents are inevitable. 

Much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels, we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends.

MT: Abracadabra? 

MT: Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality.

Technology can do the same.

Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think. 

MT: In other words, if we do not yet have the technological solutions, would illusions serve the same purpose?

To create the robotic illusion, we've devised a set of ethical rules, a code that all robots would live by. 

MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.

We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice. 

MT: We let them entertain us.

Most important, we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence. 

EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot! 

And now, under the spell of a technological illusion, we could ignore our fears and truly interact. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

EDI: Thank you!
