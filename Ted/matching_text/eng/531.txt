So I've been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues.

The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?

So I've been thinking about that problem, and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi who wrote a book called "The Lonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.

Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures, which he called Adam I and Adam II.

He wants to build, create, create companies, create innovation.

Adam II is the humble side of our nature.

Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good, to live in a way internally that honors God, creation and our possibilities.

Adam I wants to conquer the world.

Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world.

Adam I savors accomplishment.

Adam II savors inner consistency and strength.

Adam I's motto is "success."

Adam II's motto is "love, redemption and return."

And Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other.

We live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value.

And the tricky thing, I'd say, about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics.

The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic.

You have to conquer the desire to get what you want.

In order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself.

In order to find yourself, you have to lose yourself. 

We happen to live in a society that favors Adam I, and often neglects Adam II.

You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want, you hope someone will give to you.

Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses.

We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate about Adam II. 

Thanks.
