I mean, I love all kinds of rhythm.

I like to play jazz, a little funk, and hip hop, a little pop, a little R&amp;B, a little Latin, African.

Three is a groovin' number.

Three is a hip-hop kind of number.

But what does subdividing by three mean?

And counting off by four?

Well, look, think of it this way.

A measure of music as a dollar.

Now a dollar has four quarters, right?

And so does a 4/4 measure of music.

It has four quarter notes. 

Now, how do you subdivide?

CC: Okay, now you feel that?

Now let's take those three groups of four and make them four groups of three.

CC: There you go.

All right, second line.

So I want to take the second line beat and the swing beat and put them together, and it sounds something like this. 

CC: So I'll take all the rhythms that you heard earlier, we'll put them together, and they sound like this.
