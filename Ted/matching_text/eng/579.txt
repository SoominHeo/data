When this whole shebang happened, he was four.

He loved to cook.

He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions, or making invisible macaroni and cheese.

He wanted to be a chef really badly.

And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy-Bake Oven.

I mean, we all had those when we were little.

And he wanted one so badly. 

But then he started to realize something.

In the commercials, and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.

So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.

Girls cooked; boys didn't, or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. 

And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

So, needless to say, it was crazy.

It was literally one of the best moments of my life.

So, let's see.

It hurt me, and it made me think, what's the point of making change in the future? 

But then I started to realize something.

And you can make that change.

You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it.

Thank you. 

Thank you.
