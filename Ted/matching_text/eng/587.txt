Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. 

PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media, which we assumed it would be, but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions, particularly in the sector of technology and social media.

Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer, and now, often the only woman in a room.

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

Felling like I didn't belong there, feeling guilty to this day.

I got this great --- one of the first letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work, and she turned it down, and she told her best friend she turned it down, and her best friend said, you really need to watch this TED Talk.

And so she watched this TED Talk, and she went back the next day, she took the job, she went home, and she handed her husband the grocery list.

(Laughter) And she said, I can do this. 

(Laughter) And she said, I can do this. 

(Laughter) And she said, I can do this. 

And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't only women in the corporate world, even though I did hear from a lot of them, and it did impact a lot of them, it was also people of all different circumstances.

So he started paying attention, and as he waited for raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.

So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more, and it still didn't work.

So he told everyone, no more hand raising, I'm cold-calling.

And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.

And that's what I'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a -- you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.

So what did that feel like, and become like in your life?

To launch not just a book, not just a best-selling, best-viewed talk, but a movement, where people began to literally describe their actions at work as, I'm leaning in. 

Now I know there aren't a lot of men here, but bear with me.

If you're a man, you'll have to represent your gender.

Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work.

And I want you to know we're never going to do it again. 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

And so next time you all see someone call a little girl "bossy," you walk right up to that person, big smile, and you say, "That little girl's not bossy.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

PM: And you did focus in the book -- and the reason, as you said, in writing it, was to create a dialogue about this.

I mean, let's just put it out there, face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors, and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions.

SS: Well, there's certainly more dialogue, which is great.

But what really matters to me, and I think all of us, is action.

(Laughter) At all.

(Laughter) At all.

(Laughter) At all.

Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.

You know, 500 times roughly 10.

SS: And these are people who are meeting every single month.

But the fact that a woman so far away out in the world, who grew up in a rural village, who's being told to marry someone she doesn't want to marry, can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that, and find life on her own terms.

PM: Have you been surprised by the global nature of the message?

Because I think when the book first came out, many people thought, well, this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up.

SS: The book is about self-confidence, and about equality.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

And I think people don't fully understand how broad the message is.

There is a circle that's been started for rescued sex workers in Miami.

They're using "Lean In" to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing them from their pimps, and using it.

And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia.

And it's part of what TEDWomen does.

No movement in the wage gap for women in the United States.

Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.

If you are a black woman, 64 cents.

If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.

Do you know when the last time those numbers went up?

We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back -- (Applause) I think I would say in a louder voice, we need to get rid of the word "bossy" and bring back the word "feminist," because we need it.

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

SS: Thank you. 

(Applause) 

(Applause)
