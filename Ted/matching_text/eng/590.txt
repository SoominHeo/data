(Music) For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City, these shots might start to look familiar.

To really understand Central Park, you have to physically be there.

I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing -- That's us there.

Now, my brother and I, we're musicians and music producers.

We've been working together since, well, since we were kids, really.

But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space. 

But before I go too much further into that, let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea.

My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude did their temporary installation, The Gates, in Central Park.

Which brought us to this. 

Hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape, a musical score is actually unfolding around them.

So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album. 

Let's take a closer look.

Let's look at one example here.

This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.

But were you to walk in the opposite direction, this entire sequence happens in reverse.

And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park, the music would fade to silence, and the play button would disappear. 

In this case, the app is the work itself, and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience. 

But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music, is really just one idea.

Thank you.
