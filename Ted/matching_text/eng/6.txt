This is the Bop. 

The Bop is a type of social dance. 

Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression that emerges from a community.

Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change and they spread like wildfire. 

They are as old as our remembered history.

In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American traditions influenced our history.

The present always contains the past.

And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. 

The Juba dance was born from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation.

Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans to remember where they're from.

It may have looked something like this. 

It was about keeping cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. 

Now you might recognize this one.

1920s -- the Charleston.

Started by a tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. 

Enter the Twist.

The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.

Today, these dances continue to evolve, grow and spread. 

Why do we dance?

To move, to let loose, to express.

Why do we dance together?
