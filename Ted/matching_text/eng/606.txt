All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage. 

It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic.

So ROVs aren't new.

They've been around for decades.

Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.

Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction.

What we've built isn't unique.

It's how we've built it that's really unique. 

So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started.

So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras.

Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it.

We kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go to the cave.

So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times.

And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. 

But then we had to learn how to make them.

I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.

That's the only way that we could have done this.

By being open source, we've created this distributed R&amp;D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart.

But the actual robot is really only half the story.

The real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe.

What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? 

Did you find the gold?

Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable.

It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration.

It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in.

It's an underwater world we're all exploring together. 

Thank you.
