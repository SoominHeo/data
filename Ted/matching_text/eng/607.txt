So when I do my job, people hate me.

In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me.

I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.

So I go on television.

It's totally almost just like that. 

And that's just on air.

The hate mail I get is unbelievable.

Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

I care about two things.

One, I care that you spell it right.

Or do you really want to hurt me personally?

And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.

Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. 

So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging.

That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.

In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong.

And incidentally, that means that people don't like us.

Now here's the kicker.

Conservatives are really nice.

Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.

It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful. 

So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known.

Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us.

That is emotional correctness. 

I'm not saying it's easy.

An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities.

I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.

Thank you.
