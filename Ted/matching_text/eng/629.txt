I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.

You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring.

The point being, no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone.

It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone.

Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate.

I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?

So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible.

For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation.

It turns out this holds true for other species as well.

The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.

It's incredibly difficult to parse.

Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught.

The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000, eventually.

Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands.

Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.

Home is a transient concept.

"If you leave, you die."
