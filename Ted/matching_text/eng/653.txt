For a long time in my life, I felt like I'd been living two different lives.

There's the life that everyone sees, and then there's the life that only I see.

And in the life that everyone sees, who I am is a friend, a son, a brother, a stand-up comedian and a teenager.

That's the life everyone sees.

And if you were to ask me to describe myself, I'd probably say some of those same things.

In the life that only I see, who I am, who I really am, is someone who struggles intensely with depression.

I have for the last six years of my life, and I continue to every day. 

That's a natural human emotion.

Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong.

Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right.

That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from. 

And to be totally honest, that's hard for me to stand up here and say.

It's a massive problem.

And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it. 

We say we're sad and we say we're sorry, but we also say, "So what?"

I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface, you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.

You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team, the drama and theater student of the year, the English student of the year, someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party.

I came this close to doing it. 

But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.

That's what keeps you from getting help.

That's the stigma.

We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. 

We need to speak up and shatter the silence.

Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else, we all know what it is to hurt.

But right now, depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there. 

We're people, and we have problems.

We're not perfect, and that's okay. 

And I believe that we can.
