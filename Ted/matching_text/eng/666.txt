You may want to take a closer look.

There's more to this painting than meets the eye.

I painted it directly on top of the man. 

I can photograph it from any angle, and it will still look 2D.

There's no Photoshop here.

This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings. 

You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings.

But originally, this had nothing to do with either people or paint.

It was about shadows.

I came up with the idea of painting shadows.

I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on, and I thought of my friend Bernie.

But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.

I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.

I had turned my friend into a painting.

I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow, I would pull out this whole other dimension, that I would collapse it, that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. 

(Laughter) Why did this have to get in the way of all that? 

I had no idea where to begin.

It was about space and light. 

It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.

(Laughter) Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit.

It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink.

I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone. 

And if I wanted to paint on people, well, I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast.

It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself.

I was having so much fun with this process.

I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles, and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.

Thank you.
