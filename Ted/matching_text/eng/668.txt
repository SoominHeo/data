How about a moderate amount of stress? 

You can see why this study freaked me out.

Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. 

When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress. 

It's called the social stress test.

And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. 

It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

I no longer want to get rid of your stress.

I want to make you better at stress.

Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.

It enhances your empathy.

But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.

It's a natural anti-inflammatory.

It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.

But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.

How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go?

It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?
