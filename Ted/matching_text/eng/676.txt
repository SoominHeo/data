I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make.

And it hurts your throat.

So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine.

And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.

I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
