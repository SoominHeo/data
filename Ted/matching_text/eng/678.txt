This is an ambucycle.

This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency.

I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem.

When I was six years old, I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother.

I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up.

He just needed someone helping him.

Growing up, I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives.

Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child.

When I was 15, I took an EMT course, and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.

For two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem.

When we got there, 20 minutes later, we started CPR on the kid.

A doctor comes in from a block away, stop us, checks the kid, and tells us to stop CPR.

If this doctor, who lived one block away from there, would have come 20 minutes earlier, not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance, if he would have heard about it way before, he would have saved this child.

He could have run from a block away.

We're not there to replace ambulances.

We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive.

The second reason is because of our technology.

And the third thing are these ambucycles.

These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.

Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.

And these are all volunteers.

No one is getting money.

But it could spread everywhere.

It's very easy to adopt.

Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations.

And we made a difference.

We all want to be heroes.
