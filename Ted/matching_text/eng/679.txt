What do we know about the future?

Difficult question, simple answer: nothing.

We cannot predict the future.

It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

Today, we know that this future vision didn't come true.

So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature.

What are the main customers of the future?

So our children are getting larger, but at the same time we are growing into different directions.

So what we need is space inside the aircraft, inside a very dense area.

These people have different needs.

So we see a clear need of active health promotion, especially in the case of the old people.

We want to be treated as individuals.

So we combined these needs with technology's themes.

What about the data and communication software which we need in the future?

My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness.

It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology.

This will be very different in the future.

It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment.

So let's compare the old world with the new world.

It takes a lot of weight, and it follows the classical design rules.

At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos, and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.

And nature builds large skeletons out of it.

How this looks in particular, you can show it here.

And you've got trillions of them.

So you really align them to wood, and you take this wood and make morphological optimization, so you make structures, sub-structures, which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data.

So how might the airplane of the future look?
