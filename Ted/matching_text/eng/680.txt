My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine.

Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground, but outside, it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun.

Four years earlier, when I was one, after the Chernobyl accident, the rain came down black, and my sister's hair fell out in clumps, and I spent nine months in the hospital.

There were no visitors allowed, so my mother bribed a hospital worker.

She acquired a nurse's uniform, and she snuck in every night to sit by my side.

Five years later, an unexpected silver lining.

So the first day we get to New York, my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in.

So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor, and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money.

I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum.

And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn, and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order.

And he tells us to pay, but we don't speak English.

Then our neighbor pops her head in, and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.

Everyone's upset.

It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.

My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid.

And one time, when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling with roaches.

But he did have one thing.

Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.

She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight.
