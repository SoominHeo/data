But in the end everything seemed to be under control.

So he got the right weight at birth.

He got the right Apgar index.

So we were pretty reassured by this.

As you might know, a stroke is a brain injury.

So life had to change.

We needed to change our schedule.

Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine, unfortunately, we were not ready.

Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities, and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds.

And that has been really a tough time.

And what went wrong?

And this, indeed, really is tough to say, but a few months later, we realized that we were really feeling like a failure.

I mean, the only real product of our life, at the end, was a failure.

Honestly, we went down.

So immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life.

We started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation, and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot.

Basically, we spent months doing this with Mario.

You have an object, and we showed him how to grab the object.

Now, the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this, you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions.

But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand.

He was looking at us.

We were his mirror.

We restarted from our strengths, and at the same time we restarted from his strengths.

We stopped looking at him as a problem, and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve.
