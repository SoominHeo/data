Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash.

So I'd like to share with you, if I may, my experiences.

For example, the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound, which gives me that -- (Trumpet) -- flavor.

(Laughter) And the other ones here, I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that.

(Applause)
