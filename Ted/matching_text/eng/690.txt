And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.

So we need a new model.

I'm here today to offer you that new model.

Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience.

So let's do this.

So when do you play baseball?

You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule.

It's not exactly your choice.

So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home, hey, it's just batter up.

It's competitive.

But when do you have pizza?

Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.

And then when we get together with someone for pizza, we're not competing with them, we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us, and when you get together for pizza with somebody, what's the first thing you do?

When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure?

There are a million different kinds of pizza.

But what about pizza?

And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.

If we're still hungry, we might have some more.

You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison, under the baseball, it's all commands.

They're all exclamation points.

But under the pizza model, they're questions.
