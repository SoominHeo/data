But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?

I started to imagine what this would look like.

But our two hands still remain outside the screen.

How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands?

At Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace.

Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.

Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly.

But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead?

I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online.

What would such a future look like?

At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post, we created this one physical pixel.

What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies.

And by digitally programming the object, we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world.

So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality.
