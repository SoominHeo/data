Everything is interconnected.

As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.

We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. 

When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.

There were no clouds in the sky.

These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.

They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. 

Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.

I've learned to respect the lightning.

My hair used to be straight. 

I'm just kidding. 

What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.

They become lovely monsters. 

When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.

As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet.
