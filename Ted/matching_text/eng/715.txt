When I was a young boy, I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.

And they were remarkably well preserved, morphologically just phenomenal.

And we used to imagine that someday, they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin, and, if they could, they would fly away. 

They have social knits that are very close.

And then, again, as climate changed as it always does, and new habitats opened up, we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.

So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.

And then they disappear.

Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived, they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate and fast-encroaching dense forests that are migrating north, and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it, probably Pleistocene overkill, so the large game hunters that took them down. 

Fortunately, we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there and actually take them out.

And the preservation is, again, like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.

So if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process, the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped around histone proteins, is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime.

So most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.

It looks like they were interbreeding.

So large, hairless Columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies.

(Laughter)
