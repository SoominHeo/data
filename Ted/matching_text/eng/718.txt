Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Ban-gap-seum-ni-da. 

I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. 

The violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me.

Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise.

When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music. 

In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.

Do you feel like you are all alone?

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries.

Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you.

It's such an honor for me. 

I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.

But it's now your turn.

Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.

Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world.

I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

Play your life, and stay tuned.
