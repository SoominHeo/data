Until someone notices me, and I just panic.

And then, slowly, all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me and ask, almost in unison, 

I'm a visual artist.

I've been a bear. 

(Laughter) 

Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale. 

(Laughter) 

SS: I've been a greeting card. 

(Laughter) 

SS: And my personal favorite is Frankenstein's monster.

A few years ago, I made this educational video about the history of video games.

And for that one, I got to do the voice of Space Invader. 

I hit "refresh."

I was going to work on the second one next.

I hit "refresh."

(Laughter) 

I hit "refresh."

And number two, I clearly have a Pakistani accent. 

(Laughter) 

I've stuttered for as long as I can remember.

I was the kid in class who would never raise his hand when he had a question -- or knew the answer.

Every time the phone rang, I would run to the bathroom so I would not have to answer it.

If it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.

I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

And I hated introducing myself, especially in groups.

And then everybody would laugh.

That joke never got old. 

(Laughter) 

I spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke, it would become obvious that there was something wrong with me, that I was not normal.

So I mostly stayed quiet.

(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.

It's magic. 

But after the comments on the video, it no longer made me feel normal.

And so I stopped using my voice in my work.

Since then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.

And I've come to understand that "normal" has a lot to do with expectations. 

Let me give you an example.

And even when he does, he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.

For example, the sea is described as wine red, people's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.

But it's not just Homer.

If you look at all of the ancient literature -- Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian and even the original Hebrew Bible -- they all mention very few colors.

And the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color.

So basically, if you can make a color, only then can you see it.

A color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make -- they began to see that color fairly early on.
