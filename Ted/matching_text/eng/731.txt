Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters.

Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. 

But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.

Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.

I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. 

Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence.

I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years.

Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.

A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.

You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.

Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.

You are ready? 

This is a tree.

I call these eight characters radicals.

They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters.

So we have gone through almost 30 characters.

By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32.

The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32.

So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.

We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.

So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.

Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.

A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. 

This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage.
