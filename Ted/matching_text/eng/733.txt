Right? 

Now, the issue about tattoos is that, without a word, tattoos really do shout.

[Beautiful] [Intriguing] So you don't have to say a lot.

[Allegiance] [Very intimate] [Serious mistakes] (Laughter) And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.

What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor, all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos?

And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? 

What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting, blogging, following you, watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.

And electronic tattoos also shout.

If you won, she would marry you.

If you lost, you died.

How did Hippomenes beat her?

Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples, and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

And then, of course, there's Narcissus.

And that, of course, is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.
