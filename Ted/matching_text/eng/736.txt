What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you.

What did get me moving was a social interaction.

And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.

First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.

And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues, job creation, maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true.

Thank you.
