And that's what I get to do. 

Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.

And it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there.

You just have to know where to look, and to maybe be a little thin. 

Now, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology.

Now, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours.

Its closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky, in the Mammoth Cave system.

And they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them a few million years ago.

And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness.

So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision, and at the very roots of how we can see. 

So in fact, these species didn't move at all.

It's the continents that moved them.

And so they give us, through their DNA, this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events. 

It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

Unfortunately for cavefishes, their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water. 

Now, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet.

But whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology of the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness.

But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too. 

Thank you.
