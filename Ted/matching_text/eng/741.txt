When I was 14 years old, I had low self-esteem.

I felt I was not talented at anything. 

One day, I bought a yo-yo.

When I tried my first trick, it looked like this.

But after one week of practicing, my throws became more like this.

A bit better.

I found my passion.

And then, four years later, when I was 18 years old, I was standing onstage at the World Yo-Yo Contest.

So I started to consider what I should do, and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better, and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public's image of the yo-yo. 

So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer.

As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened.

I won the World Yo-Yo Contest again in the artistic performance division.

What I learned from the yo-yo is, if I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible. 

Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance?
