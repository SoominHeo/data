But if you come about it from a different perspective, you can create some more interesting, more novel concepts. 

So we built something.

I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.

So this is the motor.

But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store.

These are from remote control airplanes.

And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently, you can really change things. 

So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this.

Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco. 

It's incredible just how light this thing is.

So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.

So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city, now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation. 

So next time you think about a vehicle, I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new. 

Thank you.
