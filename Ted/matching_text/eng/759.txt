In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life.

I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.

I took a couple victory laps in there.

And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains.

(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.

Now fast forward to just three years ago.

And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.

Could we do this all in real time?

Could we have people singing together in real time? 

And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today.

Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.

The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.

We deal in milliseconds.

So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together. 

So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present "Cloudburst."
