Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.

I'm the short one.

The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea. 

I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.

But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.

So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.

The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.

That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.

Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.

The approach worked.

Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant, we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement. 

EW: The full monty. 

But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible.

Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.

How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?

We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.

Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration.

Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.

Innovation drives economic growth.
