You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.

And especially if you then ride with your bicycle, and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.

Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.

The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt.

Porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can just rain through it, so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides, and you have a road that's easy to drive on, so no splash water anymore.

Also the noise will disappear in these pores.

Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. 

And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.

Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.

To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.

If we can make this material self-healing, then probably we have a solution.

So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it.

So a microwave is a similar system.

So this is the specimen coming out now. 

So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens.

So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.

So we did aging on the samples, did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine, and healed them and tested them again.

Several times we can repeat that.

So actually, the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road, which of course saves a lot of money.
