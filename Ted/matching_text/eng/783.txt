In essence, could we "app" chemistry? 

And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. 

Now what could this mean?

Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. 

And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. 

So what could this mean?

Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. 

Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere.

You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.

We can print drugs at point of need.

We can download new diagnostics.

Say a new super bug has emerged.

You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat.

So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. 

And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go?
