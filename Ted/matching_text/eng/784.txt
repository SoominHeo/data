So, I'm an artist.

So the first of those projects ended up being something I called "One Second Every Day."

The purpose of this project is, one: I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

You know, this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

They're not even enjoying the show.

I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

I started a rule of first person perspective.

The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it. 

I turned 31 last week, which is there.

I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this.

I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.

I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.

Thank you.
