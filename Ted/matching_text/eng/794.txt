Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.

It stops. 

Great person.

She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.

And she didn't see him for years.

Most of all, I learned about love.

I learned so much about myself.

Last April, I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion.

It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers, and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.

I believe a story there has to be told.

I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.

Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.

In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.

Between April and August, 1994, one million people were slaughtered.

Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number, I want you just for a second to think of a million people.

And to give you some example, I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see, at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead.

And that was just a small percentage of the dead.

They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation, and I find this remarkable.

So when people ask me how I continue to cover war, and why I continue to do it, this is why. 

And that's pretty much why I do it. 

And there, sadly, will always be wars.

He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.

I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.

All I am is a witness.

My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.

A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world.

And that's what I try to do.

Who cares about the Congo, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life?

But my m√©tier is to bear witness and that is the crux, the heart of the matter, for us reporters who do this.

Thank you very much.
