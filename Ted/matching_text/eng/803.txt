The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.

Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.

With complete control of everything the audience can see, moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. 

Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect.

Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years.

Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.

Playing with the world, and our perception of it, really is the essence of visual effects.

So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery. 

Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions: assumption, things are as we know them; presumption, things will behave as we expect; and context in reality, our knowledge of the world as we know it, such as scale. 

Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession, which is, never betray the illusion.

And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection.

So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.

I hope you will enjoy.
