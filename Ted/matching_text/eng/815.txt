For the last 15 years that I have been performing, all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.

The hunger and thirst was, and still remains: How do I get people who hate poetry to love me?

And in 1996, I found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines, who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."

I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.

I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. 

So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.

When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.

But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.

The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business.
