Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.

Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa.

(Laughter) So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone -- I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much, except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe â€” I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities -- I did high school science -- and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper, and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know? 

So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.

Now we need to get this thing into practice.

(Laughter) 

So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available.

So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.

You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.

After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product.

We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.

(Laughter) At least once a week.

DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. 

(Applause.)
