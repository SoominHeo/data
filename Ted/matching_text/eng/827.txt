And the context I'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars.

And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school, and do it on many, many different types of terrain.

But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work, it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.

And furthermore, if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas, it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts.

So the real crux of the problem here is, how do you make a system that's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage?

And as they slide their hand down the lever, they can push with a smaller effective lever length, but push through a bigger angle every stroke, which makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.

Now the big, important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system.

That's where you can take a guy like me, an academic, but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is.

You can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face-to-face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone.

The road was too rough.

I rested for a day at home.

The next day I went to my shop.

Now everything is back to normal.
