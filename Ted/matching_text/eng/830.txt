Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. 

And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.

So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive, and the outcome of that process, namely electronic circuit boards, are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.

So they're really small, generally, they're square and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. 

Sketching an interface. 

So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things, we started to realize that, essentially, anything that we can do with paper, anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics.

So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility.

And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.
