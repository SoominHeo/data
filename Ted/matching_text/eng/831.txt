Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order, to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox. 

Well, today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox, fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most, but most of all, fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate, filled with the scriptings of ordinary people, strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee, but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing. 

But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.

They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.

We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook, and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less. 

But what if it's not about efficiency this time?

Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life, uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family.
