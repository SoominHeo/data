In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting.

Over the years, many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.

But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?

Many countries have not developed inclusive schools, and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school, at age six or seven.
