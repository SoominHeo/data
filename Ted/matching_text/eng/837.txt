Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, three days after the earthquake.

And coming home, my cofounder and I, we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.

Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home.

Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform.

But it was earlier this year, when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. 

Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.

This was a tragedy, but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing.

And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth. 

Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.

And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. 

They send him to Iraq.

Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.

That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.

It's to keep the men around him alive.

It's to pacify the village that he works in.

But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri, they get that sense of community back. 

He doesn't have that same self-worth.

But you send him to Joplin after a tornado, and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service, now they have self-worth again.
