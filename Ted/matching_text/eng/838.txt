It certainly seems that we're going about our lives, that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about, have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult, in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study. 

In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering. 

And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing?

So what did we find?

Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing.

How does that depend on what people are doing?

This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) — when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.
