As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced. 

And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist. 

And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the middle, and let's get started. 

Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles. 

MT: So over here is low tide, and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon. 

Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic. 

MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

There is the color red and the color black, representing the constant change from day to night. 

MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year? 

Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365. 

Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true. 

Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece? 

MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.

I'm performing for you. 

I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.

24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice.

Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.
