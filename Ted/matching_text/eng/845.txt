I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car, I basically had to roll down the window.

He said that it would overheat the engine.

But it was also the signal that capped the use, or overuse, of energy-consuming devices. 

We blast the air conditioning the entire way, and we never experience overheating.

So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. 

That's the first line of defense for the body.

And this gets me back to my research.

What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.

You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.

You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually.

And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls. 

And so you can imagine, even in this application, that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. 

This last project is also of components.

The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.

And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
