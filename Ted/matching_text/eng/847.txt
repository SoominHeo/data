In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business.

In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless, but as a poison, it was the best money could buy, so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands. 

The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.

You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.

Why this might be the case?

Okay, turn back, if you didn't look. 

In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust. 

This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.

Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish.

David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged.

(Laughter) And he was really gagging.

(Laughter) And he was really gagging.

(Laughter) And he was really gagging.

(Laughter) And he was really gagging.

(Laughter) And he was really gagging.

One of the features, though, of disgust, is not just its universality and its strength, but the way that it works through association.

So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing, that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.

When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.

You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images.

So here are a couple of examples.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.

So we were able to control for gender, age, income, education, even basic personality variables, and the result stays the same. 

And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.

Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative, but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.

So physiological arousal predicted, in this study, attitudes toward gay marriage. 

So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste, from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust, images like the ones I've shown you, even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean, these all have similar effects on judgment. 

When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.

In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.

For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.

And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative.

And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.

In particular, when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices, just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong.

One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.

In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.

(Laughter) (Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Laughter) 

(Laughter) (Laughter) 

They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways, but they change the way you think.

It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. 

But one thing that I am fairly certain about is, at the very least, what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
