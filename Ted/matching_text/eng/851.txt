BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right?

But we're talking about perception here, right?

Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.

They begin with a question.

(Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

(Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. 

So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?

Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist.

So if you add rules to play, you have a game.

That's actually what an experiment is. 

And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

The first step was to ask a question. 

So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. 

Now, science and asking questions is about courage.

So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way.

BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game.

AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.

We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.

What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

Student: There's two up there.

And three in here. 

(Laughter) The one on the left is mine, okay?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face.

(Laughter) And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face.

(Laughter) This is a science paper.

(Laughter) This is a science paper.

(Laughter) This is a science paper.

(Laughter) In other words, it starts off "once upon a time," the figures are in crayon, etc.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) Typical science, actually, right?

What was the feedback like?

Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?

It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.

It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.

It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.

And I'll just read one. 

(Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.

(Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.

(Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.

(Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.

(Laughter) For me, not for him.

(Laughter) For me, not for him.

(Laughter) And you like technology, right? 

(Laughter) And you like technology, right? 

(Laughter) And you like technology, right? 

(Laughter) And you like technology, right? 

Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?

You have to close your eyes, and you have to point where you hear me clapping.

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy.
