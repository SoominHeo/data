Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap.

One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. 

And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.

Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt.

Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind.

There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches, and some over cleaning.

So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?

(Applause) (Applause) Okay?

(Applause) 

Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.

We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today. 

And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do.

We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.

(Applause) (Applause)
