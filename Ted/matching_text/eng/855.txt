Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

But as these conversations unfolded, I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.

We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.

But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us. 

I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging.

First question to answer for us: so what?

Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae, but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. 

And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.

You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas.

A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.

And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost, and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. 

So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering.

And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me.
