I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.

I understand we have over 80 countries here, so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. 

In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference.

Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Applause) As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all.

(Laughter) You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.

It would say you're wrong most of the time.

That was the computer we knew.

It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.

I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc., and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.

(Laughter) She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.

(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.

(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.

(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.

(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.

(Laughter) It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. 

(Laughter) It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general.

(Laughter) It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. 

And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.

And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment. 

When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.

It could show text and after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.

And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. 

(Laughter) You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts.

(Laughter) You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts.

(Laughter) Like, we gotta go to Fear.

(Laughter) Like, we gotta go to Fear.

(Laughter) It's, like, amazing, right?

(Laughter) It's, like, amazing, right?

(Laughter) (Applause) It just changes the same content.

You feel for them.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

Free bold feels like Mandela free.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

Design does that. 

(Laughter) But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah."

(Laughter) But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah."

So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. 

It's called "Tap, Type, Write."

(Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift.

(Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift.

(Laughter) I'll show this last one.

(Laughter) I'll show this last one.

(Laughter) I'll show this last one.

(Applause) Thank you. 

So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art.

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable.

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. 

And why do we have this facility?

(Laughter) "Tell us more."

(Laughter) "Tell us more."

(Laughter) "Tell us more."

(Laughter) "Tell us more."

And he realized, it isn't about old or new.

A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.

You see it in all interesting art today, in all interesting businesses today.

We aren't functioning so easily anymore.

We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.

It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.

And so today, leaders are faced with how to lead differently, I believe.

Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.

Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.

A traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.

And by the end of the experience, I realized why I was doing this.

Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy, it's a wonderful design challenge. 

So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display on how you're interacting with them.

How many coffees do you have?

Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.

So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.

They're targeted social media systems around leaders.

(Applause) (Applause)
