And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

He said, "It's a what?"

He said, "It's a what?"

There was an important lesson for me in that.

How is it used?

So, all in all, in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. 

Well, I became a tapestry historian.

They have to be wound on huge rollers, shipped in oversized freighters.

Some of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum, we had to take them up the great steps at the front. 

We had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down, to explore the objects. 

Through this experience that could only be created in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians, artists, press, the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium. 

It wasn't just your standard installation.

And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.

It could have been a train wreck.

It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations, the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.

Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria, it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. 

I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point, opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.

It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship.

From there, you can walk in any direction to almost any culture.

They feel that the institution is elitist.

I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.
