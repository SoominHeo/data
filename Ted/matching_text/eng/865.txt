Two years ago, I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe.

The curator had only one condition: I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.

Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab, or a human being living in the world in 2010, I only had one thing to say: I wanted to say no.

And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no, and a thousand times no."

So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.

on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years, from Spain to the borders of China.

I collected my findings in a book, placed them chronologically, stating the name, the patron, the medium and the date.

Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation, which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany, in September of 2010. 

I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street.

So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you. 

One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward. 

Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo.

Now, I want to leave you with a final no.

I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.

The message reads, [Arabic] "You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."

(Applause)
