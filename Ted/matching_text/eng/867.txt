Let's start here. 

(Laughter) And, as sometimes happens, this blog acquired first dozens of readers, and then hundreds of readers, and then thousands of readers, as people tuned in to watch her rate her school lunches, including on my favorite category, "Pieces of hair found in food."

(Laughter) This was a zero day.

And then two weeks ago yesterday, she posted this.

A post that read: "Goodbye."

And she said, "I'm very sorry to tell you this, but my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore.

I really enjoyed doing this.

(Laughter) The outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous, that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves the same day and said, "We would, we would never censor a nine-year-old."

(Laughter) Except, of course, this morning.

(Laughter) And this brings up the question, what made them think they could get away with something like that?

(Laughter) And this brings up the question, what made them think they could get away with something like that?

(Laughter) And the answer is, all of human history prior to now.

(Laughter) And the answer is, all of human history prior to now. 

(Laughter) So, what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation? 

Now, this isn't just a contemporaneous question.

This is something we've faced several times over the last few centuries.

When the telegraph came along, it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry.

(Laughter) The telephone?

Even the printing press, even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.

What they got exactly wrong was what happens next. 

The more ideas there are in circulation, the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.

More media always means more arguing.

That's what happens when the media's space expands.

And yet, when we look back on the printing press in the early years, we like what happened.

We are a pro-printing press society. 

And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.

If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.

But the other thing they needed was speed.

And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists.

The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.

(Laughter) More arguing?

(Laughter) More arguing?

(Laughter) More arguing?

(Laughter) More arguing?

(Laughter) (Laughter) I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine.

(Laughter) (Laughter) I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine.

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

(Laughter) Better arguing?

And if I had to pick a group that I think is our Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service, not for more arguments, but for better arguments, I'd pick the open-source programmers.

It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere.

And you don't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this.

This is feudalism: one owner, many workers. 

The corporation owns the software.

The programmers come and go. 

But there was one programmer who decided that this wasn't the way to work.

This is Linus Torvalds.

So most open-source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems. 

This is a tremendously complicated process.

And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked, he said, "I think I know how to write a version control system for free people."

It has two big differences with traditional version control systems.

And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow, they use drawings that look like this.

And you don't have to understand what the circles and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more complicated way of working than is supported by ordinary version control systems. 

This long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change, but without any central coordination.

This has the following effect: A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software.

Each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn't know of each other's existence beforehand.

This is cooperation without coordination.

This is the big change. 

I tell you all of this because of what I think it means for the way communities come together. 

Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination, you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex. 

This is a graph of the Ruby community.

This looks like a dis-org chart, and yet, out of this community, but using these tools, they can now create something together.

So there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law. 

When you make the claim, in fact, that something on the Internet is going to be good for democracy, you often get this reaction. 

It did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea.

(Laughter) You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet people would pay for?"

(Laughter) You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet people would pay for?"

(Laughter) It took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal, right?

(Laughter) It took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal, right?

(Laughter) It took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal, right?

So, the law is also dependency-related.

This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code, and the dependencies of one law on other laws for the overall effect.

So there's that as a site for source code management.

(Laughter) Right.

(Laughter) Right.

You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored.

This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.

This shows you, for text that many people are editing, when a change was made, who made it, and what the change is.

The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted.

The stuff in green is the stuff that got added.

Programmers take this capability for granted.

Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information.

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 

The bigger problem, of course, is power.

They are experimenting with openness.

There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have a transparency move, but transparency is openness in only one direction, and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens. 

So consider this.

It was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored.

Can we use them?

Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this? 

A momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing: trial by jury, voting, peer review, now this.

The question for us now is, are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves?

Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large? 

(Applause)
