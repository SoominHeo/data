You know, we wake up in the morning, you get dressed, put on your shoes, you head out into the world.

Living in New York City, as I do, it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters, it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck.

And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and, because you choose to go down one side or the other, the rest of your life is changed forever. 

And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.

I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book.

I've never seen anything like this.

It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.

(Laughter) So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories. 

(Laughter)

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) And I came to in the morning.

Out of anesthetic, he had let them know that he wanted to be there, and he had given me about a two percent chance of living. 

So he was there when I woke up, and it was, waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. 

(Laughter) And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. 

(Laughter) And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. 

But you're alive.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Applause)
