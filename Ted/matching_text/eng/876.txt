I feel like I've got something to say and something to share. 

And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body.

It's something that I have to do with other people.

You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.

I work often with designers and visual artists, obviously dancers and other choreographers, but also, more and more, with economists, anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, people really who come from very different domains of expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process. 

Yeah, you all have a body, right?

So, we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms, yeah?

You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup, or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.

So we're experts in physical thinking already.

We just don't think about our bodies very much.

But how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally? 

What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.

I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something. 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

They have no idea what we're going to do.

I'm going to start really, really simply.

Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it, it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something very simply, where you take one idea from a body, and it happens to be my body, and translate that into somebody else's body, so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy. 

It gives me something to do, something to work towards.

And we'll see what we come up with.

It's a bit of a cross of my arm. 

Strike moment.

That's it. 

So we're starting to build a phrase. 

You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?

I'm not asking them to copy exactly.

They're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase.

I can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they're moving.

Yeah, they're super quick, right? 

So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it into something that's physical.

Some dancers, when they're watching action, take the overall shape, the arc of the movement, the kinetic sense of the movement, and use that for memory.

Some work very much in specific detail.

They start with small little units and build it up.

That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. 

So basically I'm going to make a duet.

Can you rotate?

Whoom, just go back to the beginning.

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.

Fancy having eight hours with me in a day.

(Clicks metronome) 

(Clicks metronome) 

(Applause) Okay, not bad.

(Applause) Okay, not bad.

(Applause) A little bit more?

(Applause) A little bit more?

(Applause) A little bit more?

(Clicks metronome) 

(Clicks metronome) 

(Clicks metronome) 

(Clicks metronome) 

(Clicks metronome) The duet starts.

(Clicks metronome) (Clicks metronome) So yeah, okay, good.

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

(Applause) 

That was the second way of working.

If you reach with your finger, where would it be?

If you reach with your elbow, where would it be?

Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed. 

So the dancers have been working on them.

So just keep working on them for a little second.

So, you're going to do the first solo that we made, yeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah, blah blah blah blah.

(Applause) Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?

(Applause) Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?

(Applause) Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?

(Applause) Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?

(Applause) Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?

(Clicks metronome) Here it comes, Cat.

(Clicks metronome) Paolo, go.

(Clicks metronome) Last you solo.

(Clicks metronome) Last you solo.

(Clicks metronome) (Clicks metronome) Well done.

(Clicks metronome) (Clicks metronome) Well done.
