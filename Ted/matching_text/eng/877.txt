So, embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells.

Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased. 

And so, in 2005, we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it. 

Because if you don't close that gap, you really are exactly where we are today.

And that's what I want to focus on.

So let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context.

This is an extremely new field.

So you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box, or a flight recorder.

They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong, but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events.

Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.

You can't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers.

It's a terrible business model.

But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us.

But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back.

We've got to look at the big picture.

And so we need to move away from this one-size-fits-all model.

So we really have to change this. 

But even with that, there still was another big hurdle, and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome, because we're all different.

It's like having an app without having a smartphone.

We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types that represent who we are. 

So this is what we've built.
