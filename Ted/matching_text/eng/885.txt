What should I actually try to replicate?

What should I try to emulate to some degree? 

So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.

When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after the screening was over, what they thought of it, what was your memorable shots, they changed them.

And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered. 

So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."

(Music) And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me. 

(Laughter) 

And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie, and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.

And that's simply what I did.

And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. 

(Laughter) 

I don't know why, but they thought they did. 

(Music) (Launch noises) So I showed him these two shots, and then he basically told me what he thought.

(Laughter) It's what you dream about. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting. 

(Laughter) 

So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned in that is that he remembered it differently.

He was hoping it was going to work out okay. 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

So he twisted his memory around. 

Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage, and he just responded as he would respond, and I'll run this. 

Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots I'd never seen before.

RL: I think he's a great American. 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.

I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life.

So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie, for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie, that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created. 

So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.

Jim went three miles went down, and I went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage. 

And the very next shot, right after this -- So you can see what I was doing. 

(Laughter) 

(Music)

And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you. 

Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. 

And so I'll just show it one more time.

(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift your attention, something changes, and then I left the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still on the wreck, essentially.

(Laughter) 

Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set. 

(Laughter) (Applause) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter) 

(Music) That's Hugo.

(Music) And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe, and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that this is his normal, everyday sort of life, so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important, and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick, so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task, and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.

(Music) I wouldn't say his stunt double.

(Music) I wouldn't say his stunt double.

(Music) And so this is, and now this is set number three we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically the very last moment of the shot is actually the steadycam shot.
