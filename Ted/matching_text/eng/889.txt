The will to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places.

This is where I come from, Todmorden.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Corner row railway, station car park, front of a health center, people's front gardens, and even in front of the police station.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

We've even invented a new form of tourism.

It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not, people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds, even when there's not much growing.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. 

(Laughter) We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. 

(Laughter) We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. 

(Laughter) We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. 

Can we find that language?

And then, can we replicate those actions?

So, three and a half years ago, a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.

(Laughter) And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden, look, let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates: a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives; a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves; and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support.

Now, let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food.

We're starting to build resilience ourselves.

(Applause) 

And here's the thing as well.

We've not asked anybody's permission to do this, we're just doing it.

(Laughter) And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start, and most importantly of all, we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say, "These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems," because I have seen the power of small actions, and it is awesome.

I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.

And it's been the same in every single room, in every town that we've ever told our story.

People are ready and respond to the story of food.

And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago, it's been a heck of a roller coaster.

(Laughter) So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"

This is about us going to the people and saying, "We are all part of the local food jigsaw, we are all part of a solution."

And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic, we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?

So we invented, without asking, of course, the Incredible Edible Green Route.

And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.

So we got some land that was donated by a local garden center.

So we did some really simple things.

Sales were up. 

(Laughter) And what we did was we put people on our egg map.

It's a stylized map of Togmorden.

We've got increasing market stalls selling local food, and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing.

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

(Laughter) 

Now, none of this is rocket science.

It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.

But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.

This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway.

(Laughter) (Applause) Across age, across income, across culture. 

(Laughter) (Applause) Across age, across income, across culture. 

(Laughter) (Applause) Across age, across income, across culture. 

(Laughter) (Applause) Across age, across income, across culture. 

More than 30 towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate.

People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch. 

And there's some great ideas already in our patch.

Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible, and in support of that have decided to do two things. 

Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground from local government.

(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in, day out, on our high streets, in our parks, wherever that might be.

Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.

This isn't a second class exercise.

If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow, then please let us say to every school, create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment, local food and soils.

Put that at the heart of your school culture, and you will create a different generation. 

(Applause)
