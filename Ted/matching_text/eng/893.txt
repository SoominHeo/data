I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves, but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that, so that was a bad idea.

Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer, presumably because it appeals to my well-known and abundant narcissism.

What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano.

(Music) Okay, I wrote that.

(Music) Okay, I wrote that.

No, no, I didn't write that.

In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven, and so I was not functioning as a composer.

But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"

It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. 

I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.

It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon I go through other instruments, they become familiar, and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument, and I brought one with me today, and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) And with a bank of live electronics, I can change the sounds radically.

(Music) And with a bank of live electronics, I can change the sounds radically.

(Music) (Music) Like that, and like this.

(Music) (Music) Like that, and like this.

(Music) And so forth. 

(Music) And so forth. 

(Music) And so forth. 

(Music) And so forth. 

(Applause) So in that regard, this is one of the things, this is one of the privileges of being, and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way, when I told you that I'm the world's greatest, if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.

Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.

So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me, so after a while the process of notating is not only boring, but I actually want the notation to be more interesting, and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. 

This is an excerpt from a score called "The Metaphysics of Notation."

The full score is 72 feet wide.

Now this was a really exciting experience for me.

It was gratifying musically, but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum, and that is as visual artist.

So one of the things is that, I mean, some people would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante," and maybe that's true.

I mean, there's not any traditional notation.

I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.

I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations, and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches, follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour. 

So this is a case of actually adapting something, or maybe stealing something, and then turning it into a musical notation. 

Another adaptation would be this piece.

I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.

They follow the second hands, and as they pass over the various symbols, the players respond musically.

Here's another example from another piece, and then its realization. 

And once again, this is, for me, interesting. 

Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.

This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter, who is an extraordinary performer.

Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation. 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp, the intonation was a little questionable.

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know, there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins.

(Music) (Music) 

(Music) (Music)

(Music) (Music) 

(Music) 

(Music) 

(Music)

(Applause) 

I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question, that this is not the important question.
