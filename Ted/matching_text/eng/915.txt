Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.

That's amazing.

(Applause) You just don't hear that every day. 

Usman, the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube. 

And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be -- 

CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen? 

CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it? 

Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing, and I feel really proud, really honored.

And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool. 

CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?

PR: We haven't prepared anything. 

If you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and we just see that, I just think -- I can feel it.

And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.
