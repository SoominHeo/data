I collaborate with bacteria.

And I'm about to show you some stop-motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. 

So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing, and as they do so they create an electrical charge.

One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water.

So I work in Singapore at the moment, and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology.

And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. 

So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium, potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine.

And this, in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned, equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources. 

And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube, a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. 

Thank you.
