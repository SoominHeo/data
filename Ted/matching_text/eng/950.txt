I'm going to talk about religion.

But it's a broad and very delicate subject, so I have to limit myself.

And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. 

This is a very serious talk.

So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.

To what extent are these people right?

What has happened since, and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century? 

Do you think it will decrease to one billion?

Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?

I will tell you by the end of my speech. 

But now, what does religion have to do with it?

When you want to classify religion, it's more difficult than you think.

You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.

But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups, which was too detailed. 

Each country's a bubble.

It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.

Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East, Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia.

And that is most countries in America and Europe, many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.

So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.

This is in 1960.

The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies.

So low income here, high income there. 

And indeed in 1960, you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.

The exception was Japan.

Japan here was regarded as an exception.

Otherwise it was only Christian countries.

But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman.

But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.

And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level. 

And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down, as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.

And when we enter into this century, you'll find more than half of mankind down here.

And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. 

It's a quite amazing development which has happened.

I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries.

We get that from the census data.

It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. 

So what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children.

It has happened across the world. 

And then when we look at religions, we can see that the Eastern religions, indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children.

Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity, you see countries all the way.

But there's no major difference.

There's no major difference between these religions.

There is a difference with income.

The countries which have many babies per woman here, they have quite low income.

Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.

But there are also countries here like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea, like Yemen and Afghanistan. 

Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo, which have suffered severe conflicts, that they don't have fast population growth.

It's the other way around.

In the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth.

Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.

These countries have six children per woman.

They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.

But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.

Congo will go from 60 to 120.

That's where we have the fast population growth.

And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not. 

Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country, with a Christian dominated country, Ghana.

I take them backwards here to their independence, when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.

It's a tremendous improvement. 

So what does it take?

Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries.

You need to have children to survive.

And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor. 

If I take these countries back to the years of their independence, which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 -- it's a quite amazing development which had happened.

Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.

With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. 

And what is the reason in Qatar?

I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.

This is a country that indeed has gone through a very, very interesting modernization. 

So what it is, is these four: Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work, women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. 

There are countries up here which are very poor.

And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.

I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.

And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.

So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz, it's two. 

We have reached peak child.

The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.

We are still debating peak oil, but we have definitely reached peak child.

And the world population will stop growing.

Well I will show you here.

I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.

They are quite useful for educational purposes.

Each card box is one billion people.

And there are two billion children in the world.

There are two billion young people between 15 and 30.

These are rounded numbers.

Then there is one billion between 30 and 45, almost one between 45 and 60.

Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years.

So what will happen now is quite straightforward.

The old, sadly, we will die.

The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.

Then the old will die.

The rest will grow older and get two billion children.

And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. 

This is the great fill-up.

It's inevitable.

And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children? 

Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.

All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world. 

That is needed.

But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.

So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future, for human beings on this planet, you have to plan for 10 billion.
