Gotcha. 

Don't you?

That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy?

In fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitos.

When they fly into our bedroom at night, they prefer to bite my wife. 

But that's fascinating, right?

Why does she receive more bites than I do?

And the answer is smell, the smell of her body.

And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos, some of us are just more attractive than others.

Either way, mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out.

And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use.

And this was not going to be an easy task.

And therefore, we set up various experiments.

Why did we set up these experiments?

Because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite.

My second story is remarkable as well.

In that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated.

And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem?

In fact, people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos.

Now let me show you how this works.

Now — (Laughter) — Maastricht, be prepared.

Now think of what we can do with this.
