So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.

But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is. 

It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.

Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. 

Yes. 

But these things are everywhere.

They're on sites big, they're on sites small.

This is a global experience. 

What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks.

You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.

Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk.

And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"

And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.

And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."

That's the 404 feeling. 

I mean, I've heard about that. 

Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404. 

So this turned into a contest.

Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page.

Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, commiserated with your pet.

Each one of them found this.

It turned into a 24-hour contest.

At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.

And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands.

This is one that I loved.

Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you. 

Thank you.
