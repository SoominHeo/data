To most of you, this is a device to buy, sell, play games, watch videos.

I think it might be a lifeline.

It might be the only way to communicate with your kids.

(Laughter) The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month, unless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.

I promise she read that text.

And this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.

Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth.

We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.

We've also found an unintended consequence.

We've been getting text messages back like these.

You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result.

This is really, to me, the power of texting and the power of data.

Because while people are talking about data, making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade, or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers, or some dude to build a better baseball team, I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school, to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.
