If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life, I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, the Chinese equivalency exam, and I was going to go study law in Beijing, and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms.

Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room.

And it was Doc Watson singing and playing "Shady Grove."

♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Going back to Harlan ♫ That sound was just so beautiful, the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo.

And I was like, "Sure."

It's been eight years, and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.

And the first song I wrote was in English, and the second one was in Chinese. 

And I've collaborated with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.

And I see the power of music.

I see the power of music to connect cultures.

I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese.

And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story.

They all come up and they're like, "You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China and adopted a girl."

And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.

It's just incredible.

And I see, even more importantly, the power of music to connect hearts.

Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone.

And this little girl comes up to me.

[Chinese] "Big sister Wong," Washburn, Wong, same difference.

She started singing her song.

And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks, and I started to cry.

And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever. 

And in that moment, we weren't our American selves, we weren't our Chinese selves, we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here.

I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone.

And I know U.S.-China relations doesn't need another lawyer. 

Thank you.
