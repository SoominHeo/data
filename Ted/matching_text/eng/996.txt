And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point, that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to.

So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

And the second point, making the case that kids can really change the world. 

So you may ask -- (Applause) You may ask me, well how do you know what our energy future is?

Well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old.

That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.

I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

I decided I wanted to make a star. 

And it slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.

So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.

So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has.

For hundreds of dollars, I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

I built this in my garage. 

So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.

That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor.

So maybe I don't want to admit to that.

And this is me with President Obama, showing him my Homeland Security research. 

So thank you very much.
