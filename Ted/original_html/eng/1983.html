<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="6000" id="t-6000">so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="13000" id="t-13000">In 1978, I was working for Time magazine,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="16000" id="t-16000">and I was given a three-day assignment</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="18000" id="t-18000">to photograph Amerasian children,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="20000" id="t-20000">children who had been fathered by American GIs</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="22000" id="t-22000">all over Southeast Asia, and then abandoned --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="25000" id="t-25000">40,000 children all over Asia.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="27000" id="t-27000">I had never heard the word Amerasian before.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="29000" id="t-29000">I spent a few days photographing children in different countries,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="36000" id="t-36000">I always hope that when my pictures were published,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="62000" id="t-62000">than I thought I had done for Time magazine.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="65000" id="t-65000">In the course of doing the story,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="68000" id="t-68000">I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="73000" id="t-73000">and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="76000" id="t-76000">that they worked with a lot of Americans who were</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="78000" id="t-78000">donating money to help some of these kids.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="81000" id="t-81000">And a man told me, who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="85000" id="t-85000">that there was a young girl, who was 11 years old, being raised by her grandmother.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="88000" id="t-88000">And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="91000" id="t-91000">Every time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="94000" id="t-94000">And of course, I was immediately intrigued.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="96000" id="t-96000">I saw photographs of her, and I thought I wanted to go.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="99000" id="t-99000">And the guy just told me, "There's no way. This grandmother won't even -- you know,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="102000" id="t-102000">there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising."</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__para__text">
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="104000" id="t-104000">I took a translator with me, and went to this village,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="107000" id="t-107000">found the grandmother, sat down with her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="109000" id="t-109000">And to my astonishment, she agreed to let me</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="111000" id="t-111000">photograph her granddaughter.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="113000" id="t-113000">And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="116000" id="t-116000">if it would be OK if I stayed for the week.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="118000" id="t-118000">I had a sleeping bag.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="120000" id="t-120000">The family had a small shed on the side of the house,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="123000" id="t-123000">so I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="126000" id="t-126000">And I just told the little girl, whose name was Hyun-Sook Lee,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="131000" id="t-131000">that if I ever did anything to embarrass her --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="133000" id="t-133000">she didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="135000" id="t-135000">she could just put up her hand and say, "Stop,"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="137000" id="t-137000">and I would stop taking pictures.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="139000" id="t-139000">And then, my translator left.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="140000" id="t-140000">So there I was, I couldn't speak a word of Korean,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="142000" id="t-142000">and this is the first night I met Hyun-Sook.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="144000" id="t-144000">Her mother was still alive.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="146000" id="t-146000">Her mother was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="148000" id="t-148000">And what struck me immediately was</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="151000" id="t-151000">how in love the two of these people were.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="155000" id="t-155000">The grandmother was incredibly fond, deeply in love with this little girl.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="158000" id="t-158000">They slept on the floor at night.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="160000" id="t-160000">The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="163000" id="t-163000">so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="165000" id="t-165000">Hyun-Sook was 11 years old.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__para__text">
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="167000" id="t-167000">I had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="169000" id="t-169000">Hyun-Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="173000" id="t-173000">And almost universally, amongst all the kids,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="175000" id="t-175000">they were really psychologically damaged by</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="178000" id="t-178000">having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="182000" id="t-182000">And Korea was probably the place I found</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="184000" id="t-184000">to be the worst for these kids.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="186000" id="t-186000">And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun-Sook</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="189000" id="t-189000">was how confident she appeared to be,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="191000" id="t-191000">how happy she seemed to be in her own skin.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="193000" id="t-193000">And remember this picture,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="194000" id="t-194000">because I'm going to show you another picture later,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="196000" id="t-196000">but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="198000" id="t-198000">although she looks so Western.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="200000" id="t-200000">I decided to follow her to school.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="201000" id="t-201000">This is the first morning I stayed with her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="203000" id="t-203000">This is on the way to school.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="205000" id="t-205000">This is the morning assembly outside her school.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="212000" id="t-212000">And I noticed that she was clowning around.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="215000" id="t-215000">When the teachers would ask questions,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="217000" id="t-217000">she'd be the first person to raise her hand.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="219000" id="t-219000">Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="221000" id="t-221000">or anything like the other children that I'd photographed.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="224000" id="t-224000">Again, the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="226000" id="t-226000">Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="228000" id="t-228000">in the middle of class.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="230000" id="t-230000">And one of the other things that I said to her through the translator --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="232000" id="t-232000">again, this thing about saying stop -- was to not pay attention to me.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="238000" id="t-238000">And so, she really just completely ignored me most of the time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="240000" id="t-240000">I noticed that at recess, she was the girl</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="243000" id="t-243000">who picked the other girls to be on her team.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="246000" id="t-246000">It was very obvious, from the very beginning, that she was a leader.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="248000" id="t-248000">This is on the way home.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="249000" id="t-249000">And that's North Korea up along the hill.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="251000" id="t-251000">This is up along the DMZ.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="253000" id="t-253000">They would actually cover the windows every night, so that light couldn't be seen,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="256000" id="t-256000">because the South Korean government has said for years</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="259000" id="t-259000">that the North Koreans may invade at any time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="261000" id="t-261000">So there's always this -- the closer you were to North Korea, the more terrifying it was.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="272000" id="t-272000">And I would stand at attention, and all the girls would crack up,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="274000" id="t-274000">and it was sort of a little joke.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="278000" id="t-278000">The end of the week came and my translator came back,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="279000" id="t-279000">because I'd asked her to come back,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="281000" id="t-281000">so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun-Sook.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="285000" id="t-285000">And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="287000" id="t-287000">the grandmother started crying.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="289000" id="t-289000">And I said to my translator, "What's going on, why is she crying?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="292000" id="t-292000">And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="296000" id="t-296000">And I said, "OK, what did I do? What's going on?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="298000" id="t-298000">Why is everyone crying?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="300000" id="t-300000">And the translator said, "The grandmother says</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="302000" id="t-302000">that she thinks she's dying,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="304000" id="t-304000">and she wants to know if you would take Hyun-Sook to America with you."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="308000" id="t-308000">And I said, "I'm 28 years old, and I live in hotels,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="315000" id="t-315000">I mean I had fallen in love with this girl,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="318000" id="t-318000">but I -- you know, it was, like, emotionally I was about 12 years old.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="321000" id="t-321000">If you know of photographers, the joke is</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="323000" id="t-323000">it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="326000" id="t-326000">"Sorry, I have to go on an assignment, I'll be back" --</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="330000" id="t-330000">So, I asked the translator why she thought she was dying.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="336000" id="t-336000">Can I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="338000" id="t-338000">And she refused any help at all.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="340000" id="t-340000">And so, when I got outside,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="342000" id="t-342000">I actually gave the translator some money and said,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="344000" id="t-344000">"Please go back and see if you can do something."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="346000" id="t-346000">And I gave the grandmother my business card.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="348000" id="t-348000">And I said, "If you're serious, I will try to find a family for her."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="351000" id="t-351000">And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="353000" id="t-353000">in Atlanta, Georgia, who had an 11-year-old son.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="356000" id="t-356000">And my best friend had mistakenly one day</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="359000" id="t-359000">said something about wishing he had another child.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="363000" id="t-363000">So here my friends Gene and Gail had not heard from me in about a year,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="367000" id="t-367000">and suddenly I was calling, saying "I'm in Korea,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="369000" id="t-369000">and I've met this extraordinary girl."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="371000" id="t-371000">And I said, "The grandmother thinks she's sick,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="378000" id="t-378000">And I said, "I'll pay for the ... " I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="381000" id="t-381000">So anyway, I left.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="383000" id="t-383000">And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="388000" id="t-388000">And I said, "Look, I think I'll scare the grandmother to death,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="390000" id="t-390000">if I actually write to her and tell her</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="392000" id="t-392000">that you're willing to adopt her, I want to go back and talk to her."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="394000" id="t-394000">But I was off on assignment.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="403000" id="t-403000">and got a telegram -- back in those days, you got telegrams --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="406000" id="t-406000">from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="408000" id="t-408000">and left their child in a will to me.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="411000" id="t-411000">Did I know anything about this?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="413000" id="t-413000">Because I hadn't told them what I was doing,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="415000" id="t-415000">because I was so upset with the story they'd run.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="417000" id="t-417000">So, I went back to Korea, and I went back to Hyun-Sook's village,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="420000" id="t-420000">and she was gone.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="422000" id="t-422000">And the house that I had spent time in was empty.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="424000" id="t-424000">It was incredibly cold.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="426000" id="t-426000">No one in the village would tell me where Hyun-Sook was,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="428000" id="t-428000">because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="431000" id="t-431000">And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="434000" id="t-434000">So I finally found Myung Sung,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="437000" id="t-437000">her best friend that she used to play with after school every day.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="439000" id="t-439000">And Myung Sung, under some pressure from me and the translator,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="443000" id="t-443000">gave us an address on the outside of Seoul.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="446000" id="t-446000">And I went to that address and knocked on the door,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="449000" id="t-449000">and a man answered the door.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="451000" id="t-451000">It was not a very nice area of Seoul,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="454000" id="t-454000">as there were mud streets outside of it.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="456000" id="t-456000">And I knocked on the door, and Hyun-Sook answered the door,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="459000" id="t-459000">and her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="462000" id="t-462000">She didn't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="465000" id="t-465000">And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="467000" id="t-467000">And I said to the translator, "What did he say?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="470000" id="t-470000">And she said, "He wants to know who you are."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="472000" id="t-472000">And I said, "Well, tell him that I am a photographer."</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="492000" id="t-492000">So I was -- you know, the door was being slammed in my face,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="496000" id="t-496000">it's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="498000" id="t-498000">"What would the hero do in a movie,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="500000" id="t-500000">if I was writing this as a movie script?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="502000" id="t-502000">So I said, "Listen, it's really cold, I've come a very long way,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="504000" id="t-504000">do you mind if I just come in for a minute? I'm freezing."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="506000" id="t-506000">So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="509000" id="t-509000">And as we started talking, I saw him yell something,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="512000" id="t-512000">and Hyun-Sook came and brought us some food.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="516000" id="t-516000">And I had this whole mental picture of, sort of like Cinderella.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="519000" id="t-519000">I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="522000" id="t-522000">bright, happy little child, who now appeared to be very withdrawn,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="527000" id="t-527000">being enslaved by this family.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="529000" id="t-529000">And I was really appalled, and I couldn't figure out what to do.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="532000" id="t-532000">And the more I tried talking to him, the less friendly he was getting.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="535000" id="t-535000">So I finally decided, I said "Look," --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="537000" id="t-537000">this is all through the translator, because, this is all,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="539000" id="t-539000">you know, I don't speak a word of Korean --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="541000" id="t-541000">and I said, "Look, I'm really glad that Hyun-Sook has a family to live with.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="544000" id="t-544000">I was very worried about her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="546000" id="t-546000">I made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="550000" id="t-550000">and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="552000" id="t-552000">I said, "But you know, I bought an airline ticket,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="554000" id="t-554000">and I'm stuck here for a week."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="555000" id="t-555000">And I said, "I'm staying in a hotel downtown.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="557000" id="t-557000">Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="559000" id="t-559000">And you can practice your English." Because he told me --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="561000" id="t-561000">I was trying to ask him questions about himself.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="563000" id="t-563000">And so I went to the hotel, and I found two older Amerasians.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="570000" id="t-570000">A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="574000" id="t-574000">and she was a prostitute,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="576000" id="t-576000">and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="578000" id="t-578000">And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="580000" id="t-580000">who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="584000" id="t-584000">I said, "I don't know if it's the right decision or not,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="587000" id="t-587000">but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="589000" id="t-589000">and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="591000" id="t-591000">what people say to you, what you do for a living.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="594000" id="t-594000">And just -- I want him to understand what happens if she stays here.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="597000" id="t-597000">And I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow."</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="754000" id="t-754000">Hyun-Sook stayed at Father Keene's,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="902000" id="t-902000">where you saw the pictures, and we got to the front desk</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="904000" id="t-904000">and the guy at the front desk said,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="906000" id="t-906000">"There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="908000" id="t-908000">so if you want to put the kids five floors below you, there's a room there."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="912000" id="t-912000">And Gene and I looked at each other and said,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="914000" id="t-914000">"No, we don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="916000" id="t-916000">So, his son said, "Dad, I have a sleeping bag, I'll sleep on the floor."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="919000" id="t-919000">And I said, "Yeah, I have one too."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="921000" id="t-921000">So, Tim and I slept on the floor,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="923000" id="t-923000">Natasha got one bed, Gene got the other -- kids pass out,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="925000" id="t-925000">it's been very exciting for three days.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="927000" id="t-927000">We're lying in bed, and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="931000" id="t-931000">We said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="934000" id="t-934000">We were just like, you know, ah, just full of ourselves.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="938000" id="t-938000">And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room, you know,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="940000" id="t-940000">for a couple of months now.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="942000" id="t-942000">And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="946000" id="t-946000">so during the day I always left the window open.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="948000" id="t-948000">And then, at night, about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="950000" id="t-950000">So at about 1 a.m., the whole room would be like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="954000" id="t-954000">I'd been doing this every night I'd been there.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="956000" id="t-956000">So, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="959000" id="t-959000">I go to close the window, and I hear people shouting outside,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="963000" id="t-963000">and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="965000" id="t-965000">And I don't speak Korean, but I'm hearing these voices,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="967000" id="t-967000">and I'm not hearing anger, I'm hearing terror.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="971000" id="t-971000">So, I open the window, and I look out,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="973000" id="t-973000">and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="975000" id="t-975000">and the hotel's on fire.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="977000" id="t-977000">So, I run over to Gene, and I wake him up,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="979000" id="t-979000">and I say, "Gene, don't freak out, I think the hotel's on fire."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="982000" id="t-982000">And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we're on the eleventh floor.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="986000" id="t-986000">So, the two of us were just like, "Oh my God, oh my God."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="988000" id="t-988000">So, we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="992000" id="t-992000">And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="994000" id="t-994000">it's like they took five Valiums -- you know, they're all over the place.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="997000" id="t-997000">And we can't talk to her.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="999000" id="t-999000">I remember his son had the L.L. Bean bootlaces,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1001000" id="t-1001000">and we're trying to do up his laces.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1003000" id="t-1003000">So, we try to get to the door, and we run to the door,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1005000" id="t-1005000">and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1008000" id="t-1008000">There's people screaming, there's the sound of glass breaking,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1010000" id="t-1010000">there's these weird thumps.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1012000" id="t-1012000">And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1015000" id="t-1015000">And Gene turns around and says, "We're not going to make it."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1017000" id="t-1017000">And he closes the door, and the whole room is now filled with smoke.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1021000" id="t-1021000">We're all choking, and there's smoke pouring through the vents,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1023000" id="t-1023000">under the doors. There's people screaming.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1025000" id="t-1025000">I just remember this unbelievable, just utter chaos.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1029000" id="t-1029000">I remember sitting near the bed, and I was just so --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1031000" id="t-1031000">I had two overwhelming feelings.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1033000" id="t-1033000">One was absolute terror -- it's like, "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1035000" id="t-1035000">This has got to be a nightmare, this can't be happening.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1037000" id="t-1037000">Please, I just want to wake up, it's got to be a nightmare."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1039000" id="t-1039000">And the other is unbelievable guilt.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1041000" id="t-1041000">Here I've been, playing God with my friends' lives, my friends' son, with Natasha's life,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1046000" id="t-1046000">and this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1049000" id="t-1049000">I remember just being so frightened and terrified.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1051000" id="t-1051000">And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1053000" id="t-1053000">"Man, we've got to soak towels." I said, "What?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1055000" id="t-1055000">He says, "We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1057000" id="t-1057000">So, we ran to the bathroom, and got towels,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1059000" id="t-1059000">and put them over our faces, and the kids faces.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1061000" id="t-1061000">Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1063000" id="t-1063000">I said, "What?" He said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1065000" id="t-1065000">I said, "Yeah, somewhere in my Halliburton."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1067000" id="t-1067000">He says, "We've got to stop the smoke."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1069000" id="t-1069000">He said, "That's all we can do, we've got to stop the smoke."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1071000" id="t-1071000">I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1073000" id="t-1073000">So, we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1077000" id="t-1077000">we put blankets at the bottom of the door,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1079000" id="t-1079000">we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1082000" id="t-1082000">And there was a building, a new building, going up,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1084000" id="t-1084000">that was being built right outside, across the street from our hotel.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1087000" id="t-1087000">And there, in the building were photographers</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1088000" id="t-1088000">waiting for people to jump.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1090000" id="t-1090000">Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1093000" id="t-1093000">Five people jumped and died, other people were killed by the smoke.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1099000" id="t-1099000">And there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1102000" id="t-1102000">in all this, and people were shouting in Korean.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1104000" id="t-1104000">And I remember, Natasha didn't want us opening the door --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1111000" id="t-1111000">sorry, I was trying not to open the door,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1113000" id="t-1113000">because we'd spent so much time barricading the room.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1115000" id="t-1115000">I didn't know who it was, I didn't know what they wanted,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1117000" id="t-1117000">and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1121000" id="t-1121000">I remember a sort of a tussle at the door, trying to get the door open.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1124000" id="t-1124000">In any case, 12 hours later, I mean, they put us in the lobby.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1130000" id="t-1130000">Gene ended up using his coat, and his fist in the coat, to break open a liquor cabinet.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1134000" id="t-1134000">People were lying on the floor.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1136000" id="t-1136000">It was one of just the most horrifying nights.</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1139000" id="t-1139000">And then 12 hours later, we rented a car, as we had planned to,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1142000" id="t-1142000">and drove back to Natasha's village.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1144000" id="t-1144000">And we kept saying, "Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1146000" id="t-1146000">like eight hours ago?"</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1148000" id="t-1148000">It's so weird how life just goes on.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1150000" id="t-1150000">Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1153000" id="t-1153000">and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1157000" id="t-1157000">This guy's 60 years old.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1159000" id="t-1159000">So it turned into a dual celebration, because Natasha was the first person</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1161000" id="t-1161000">from this village ever to go to the United States.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1163000" id="t-1163000">So, these are the greenhouse tents.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1165000" id="t-1165000">This is the elders teaching Gene their dances.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1168000" id="t-1168000">We drank a lot of rice wine. We were both so drunk,</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1186000" id="t-1186000">So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1189000" id="t-1189000">and I photographed them, and told them</span>

<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1216000" id="t-1216000">And the pilot, I actually knew -- because they used to let me sit</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1219000" id="t-1219000">in the jump seat, to tell you how long ago this was.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1221000" id="t-1221000">This is a Tri-Star, and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1225000" id="t-1225000">And the pilot, Jeff Cowley, actually went back</span>
