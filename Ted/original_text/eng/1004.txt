id="t-6000"&&And the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer.
id="t-10000"&&And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.
id="t-12000"&&And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes, "You see this bar?
id="t-16000"&&I built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county.
id="t-20000"&&Gave it more love and care than my own child.

id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-67000"&&Storytelling -- (Laughter) is joke telling.
id="t-74000"&&It's knowing your punchline, your ending, knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last, is leading to a singular goal, and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings.
id="t-91000"&&We all love stories.
id="t-93000"&&We're born for them.
id="t-95000"&&Stories affirm who we are.
id="t-97000"&&We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.
id="t-99000"&&And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories.
id="t-103000"&&It can cross the barriers of time, past, present and future, and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others, real and imagined. 

id="t-114000"&&The children's television host Mr. Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story."
id="t-127000"&&And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment, which is "Make me care" -- please, emotionally, intellectually, aesthetically, just make me care.
id="t-143000"&&We all know what it's like to not care.
id="t-145000"&&You've gone through hundreds of TV channels, just switching channel after channel, and then suddenly you actually stop on one.
id="t-152000"&&It's already halfway over, but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.
id="t-157000"&&That's not by chance, that's by design. 

id="t-161000"&&So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story, how I was born for it, how I learned along the way this subject matter?
id="t-170000"&&And to make it more interesting, we'll start from the ending and we'll go to the beginning.
id="t-176000"&&And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story, it would go something like this: And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story. 

id="t-188000"&&And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in 2012.

id="t-200000"&&And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.
id="t-206000"&&And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion with a telegram saying, "See me at once."
id="t-211000"&&But once he gets there, he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property. 

id="t-221000"&&(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.
id="t-223000"&&Thing only opens from the inside.
id="t-226000"&&He insisted, no embalming, no open coffin, no funeral.
id="t-232000"&&You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us, huh?
id="t-237000"&&Come, let's go inside. 

id="t-258000"&&AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book, is it's fundamentally making a promise.
id="t-262000"&&It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.
id="t-266000"&&And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.
id="t-269000"&&You could do it an infinite amount of ways.
id="t-271000"&&Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... " These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.
id="t-278000"&&And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.
id="t-280000"&&It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire, or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.
id="t-286000"&&It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else, but it's going to be worth your time."
id="t-290000"&&A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end. 

id="t-300000"&&In 2008, I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project.

id="t-371000"&&AS: Storytelling without dialogue.
id="t-373000"&&It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.
id="t-375000"&&It's the most inclusive approach you can take.
id="t-378000"&&It confirmed something I really had a hunch on, is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal.
id="t-384000"&&They just don't want to know that they're doing that.
id="t-387000"&&That's your job as a storyteller, is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal.
id="t-393000"&&We're born problem solvers.
id="t-395000"&&We're compelled to deduce and to deduct, because that's what we do in real life.
id="t-401000"&&It's this well-organized absence of information that draws us in.
id="t-406000"&&There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.
id="t-409000"&&It's not just that they're damn cute; it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are.
id="t-416000"&&And it's like a magnet.
id="t-418000"&&We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in. 

id="t-422000"&&I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."
id="t-428000"&&And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.
id="t-431000"&&Make the audience put things together.
id="t-433000"&&Don't give them four, give them two plus two.
id="t-437000"&&The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.
id="t-443000"&&Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.
id="t-446000"&&It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story.
id="t-450000"&&I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science, it's not.
id="t-455000"&&That's what's so special about stories, they're not a widget, they aren't exact.
id="t-460000"&&Stories are inevitable, if they're good, but they're not predictable. 

id="t-464000"&&I took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.
id="t-470000"&&And I learned a key insight to character.
id="t-472000"&&She believed that all well-drawn characters have a spine.
id="t-477000"&&And the idea is that the character has an inner motor, a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for, an itch that they can't scratch.
id="t-484000"&&She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather," and that probably his spine was to please his father.
id="t-492000"&&And it's something that always drove all his choices.
id="t-494000"&&Even after his father died, he was still trying to scratch that itch.
id="t-500000"&&I took to this like a duck to water.
id="t-503000"&&Wall-E's was to find the beauty.
id="t-506000"&&Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo," was to prevent harm.
id="t-512000"&&And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.
id="t-515000"&&And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.
id="t-518000"&&Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them. 

id="t-521000"&&I'm really blessed to be a parent, and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way, and you don't have any say about it, and there's no changing it.
id="t-534000"&&All you can do is learn to recognize it and own it.
id="t-540000"&&And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive, some are negative.
id="t-544000"&&But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it.
id="t-553000"&&As parents, you're always learning who your children are.
id="t-556000"&&They're learning who they are.
id="t-558000"&&And you're still learning who you are.
id="t-560000"&&So we're all learning all the time.
id="t-563000"&&And that's why change is fundamental in story.
id="t-566000"&&If things go static, stories die, because life is never static. 

id="t-571000"&&In 1998, I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life" and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.
id="t-577000"&&So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.
id="t-580000"&&So I researched everything I possibly could.
id="t-583000"&&And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright, William Archer: "Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."
id="t-592000"&&It's an incredibly insightful definition. 

id="t-595000"&&When you're telling a story, have you constructed anticipation?
id="t-599000"&&In the short-term, have you made me want to know what will happen next?
id="t-603000"&&But more importantly, have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term?
id="t-609000"&&Have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be?
id="t-615000"&&An example would be in "Finding Nemo," in the short tension, you were always worried, would Dory's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.
id="t-623000"&&But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge, vast ocean? 

id="t-629000"&&In our earliest days at Pixar, before we truly understood the invisible workings of story, we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.
id="t-637000"&&And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good.
id="t-643000"&&You've got to remember that in this time of year, 1993, what was considered a successful animated picture was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin," "Lion King."
id="t-656000"&&So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time, he walked in and he said, "You don't want me to sing, do you?"
id="t-663000"&&And I thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.
id="t-668000"&&But we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation. 

id="t-673000"&&We didn't have any influence then, so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves.
id="t-679000"&&And they were: No songs, no "I want" moment, no happy village, no love story.
id="t-688000"&&And the irony is that, in the first year, our story was not working at all and Disney was panicking.
id="t-694000"&&So they privately got advice from a famous lyricist, who I won't name, and he faxed them some suggestions.
id="t-701000"&&And we got a hold of that fax.
id="t-703000"&&And the fax said, there should be songs, there should be an "I want" song, there should be a happy village song, there should be a love story and there should be a villain.
id="t-715000"&&And thank goodness we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.
id="t-720000"&&That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story.
id="t-725000"&&And a year after that, we did conquer it.
id="t-727000"&&And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines, not hard, fast rules. 

id="t-733000"&&Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character.
id="t-737000"&&And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace.
id="t-737000"&&And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace.
id="t-737000"&&And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace.

id="t-746000"&&(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?
id="t-748000"&&Off the bed.
id="t-750000"&&Hey, off the bed!
id="t-750000"&&Hey, off the bed!
id="t-750000"&&Hey, off the bed!
id="t-754000"&&Woody: No, he is.
id="t-754000"&&Woody: No, he is.
id="t-754000"&&Woody: No, he is.
id="t-760000"&&Get up here and do your job.
id="t-762000"&&Are you deaf?
id="t-764000"&&I said, take care of them.
id="t-766000"&&Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody, but I have to agree with them.
id="t-770000"&&I don't think what you did was right.
id="t-770000"&&I don't think what you did was right.
id="t-770000"&&I don't think what you did was right.
id="t-775000"&&You don't think I was right?
id="t-777000"&&Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener? 

id="t-782000"&&AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?
id="t-784000"&&We realized, you can make him kind, generous, funny, considerate, as long as one condition is met for him, is that he stays the top toy.
id="t-792000"&&And that's what it really is, is that we all live life conditionally.
id="t-796000"&&We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along, as long as certain conditions are met.
id="t-801000"&&After that, all bets are off.
id="t-803000"&&And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career, I can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story. 

id="t-812000"&&In 1986, I truly understood the notion of story having a theme.
id="t-818000"&&And that was the year that they restored and re-released "Lawrence of Arabia."
id="t-823000"&&And I saw that thing seven times in one month.
id="t-826000"&&I couldn't get enough of it.
id="t-828000"&&I could just tell there was a grand design under it -- in every shot, every scene, every line.
id="t-833000"&&Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on.
id="t-833000"&&Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on.
id="t-833000"&&Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on.
id="t-842000"&&And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings, that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert and he's reached the Suez Canal, and I suddenly got it.

id="t-871000"&&Cyclist: Who are you?
id="t-875000"&&Who are you? 

id="t-878000"&&AS: That was the theme: Who are you?
id="t-881000"&&Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him, but underneath it was a constant, a guideline, a road map.
id="t-892000"&&Everything Lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.
id="t-897000"&&A strong theme is always running through a well-told story. 

id="t-903000"&&When I was five, I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that I feel a story should have, but is rarely invoked.
id="t-913000"&&And this is what my mother took me to when I was five. 

(Video) Thumper: Come on.
(Video) Thumper: Come on.
id="t-922000"&&Look.
id="t-924000"&&The water's stiff.
id="t-930000"&&Bambi: Yippee!
id="t-942000"&&Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?
id="t-942000"&&Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?
id="t-942000"&&Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?
id="t-949000"&&Like this.
id="t-949000"&&Like this.
id="t-949000"&&Like this.

id="t-972000"&&AS: I walked out of there wide-eyed with wonder.
id="t-976000"&&And that's what I think the magic ingredient is, the secret sauce, is can you invoke wonder.
id="t-982000"&&Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
id="t-984000"&&It can't be artificially evoked.
id="t-986000"&&For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling -- to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder.
id="t-996000"&&When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive, it reaches you almost to a cellular level.
id="t-1002000"&&And when an artist does that to another artist, it's like you're compelled to pass it on.
id="t-1006000"&&It's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.
id="t-1011000"&&Do unto others what's been done to you.
id="t-1014000"&&The best stories infuse wonder. 

id="t-1017000"&&When I was four years old, I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were.
id="t-1026000"&&And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head, but I couldn't see them because of my hair.
id="t-1030000"&&And he explained that when I was born, I was born premature, that I came out much too early, and I wasn't fully baked; I was very, very sick.
id="t-1041000"&&And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth, he looked straight at my mom and said, "He's not going to live."
id="t-1049000"&&And I was in the hospital for months.
id="t-1052000"&&And many blood transfusions later, I lived, and that made me special. 

id="t-1059000"&&I don't know if I really believe that.
id="t-1062000"&&I don't know if my parents really believe that, but I didn't want to prove them wrong.
id="t-1068000"&&Whatever I ended up being good at, I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given. 

id="t-1075000"&&(Video) (Crying) Marlin: There, there, there.
id="t-1091000"&&It's okay, daddy's here.
id="t-1094000"&&Daddy's got you.

id="t-1105000"&&AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.
id="t-1105000"&&AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.
id="t-1111000"&&It doesn't always mean plot or fact.
id="t-1113000"&&It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it, expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core.
id="t-181000"&&And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTalk today. 

id="t-1125000"&&Thank you.
