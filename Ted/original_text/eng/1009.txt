id="t-0"&&I'm going to speak about a tiny, little idea.
id="t-5000"&&And this is about shifting baseline.
id="t-9000"&&And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time.
id="t-18000"&&And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
id="t-23000"&&And he was here, as you well know, in '35.
id="t-26000"&&And you'd think he was chasing finches, but he wasn't.
id="t-30000"&&He was actually collecting fish.
id="t-32000"&&And he described one of them as very "common."
id="t-36000"&&This was the sailfin grouper.
id="t-38000"&&A big fishery was run on it until the '80s.
id="t-43000"&&Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
id="t-46000"&&Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places, so there is nothing particular about it.
id="t-56000"&&But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.
id="t-59000"&&We still think it is pristine.
id="t-62000"&&The brochures still say it is untouched.
id="t-67000"&&So what happens here? 

id="t-70000"&&The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline.
id="t-75000"&&(Laughter) Because I was there in '71, studying a lagoon in West Africa.
id="t-82000"&&I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa.
id="t-87000"&&And I thought I could blend in.
id="t-89000"&&And I got a big sunburn, and I was convinced that I was really not from there.
id="t-94000"&&This was my first sunburn. 

id="t-96000"&&And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees, as you can see, and a few mangrove.
id="t-103000"&&And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.
id="t-109000"&&And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana.
id="t-118000"&&When I went there 27 years later, the fish had shrunk to half of their size.
id="t-124000"&&They were maturing at five centimeters.
id="t-126000"&&They had been pushed genetically.
id="t-128000"&&There were still fishes.
id="t-130000"&&They were still kind of happy.
id="t-132000"&&And the fish also were happy to be there.
id="t-137000"&&So nothing has changed, but everything has changed. 

id="t-141000"&&My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia.
id="t-149000"&&In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s -- Europe did lots of development projects.
id="t-155000"&&Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing.
id="t-165000"&&And this boat, quite ugly, is called the Mutiara 4.
id="t-169000"&&And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea.
id="t-179000"&&And what we caught, we didn't have words for it.
id="t-183000"&&What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea.
id="t-188000"&&And 90 percent of our catch were sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom.
id="t-195000"&&And actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debris, the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.
id="t-202000"&&Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. 

id="t-206000"&&And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid.
id="t-212000"&&Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins.
id="t-217000"&&The bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess.
id="t-225000"&&This is a dead turtle.
id="t-227000"&&They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
id="t-230000"&&And one time we caught a live one.
id="t-232000"&&It was not drowned yet.
id="t-234000"&&And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
id="t-237000"&&This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished.
id="t-247000"&&But it's not documented. 

id="t-249000"&&We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
id="t-253000"&&We adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there.
id="t-262000"&&If you generalize this, something like this happens.
id="t-266000"&&You have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply.
id="t-275000"&&And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally.
id="t-281000"&&Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward.
id="t-292000"&&And the difference then, they perceive as a loss.
id="t-296000"&&But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
id="t-299000"&&You can have a succession of changes.
id="t-301000"&&At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers.
id="t-307000"&&And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.
id="t-310000"&&We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. 

id="t-317000"&&Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations.
id="t-331000"&&Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it becomes rare.
id="t-345000"&&So you don't lose abundant animals.
id="t-348000"&&You always lose rare animals.
id="t-350000"&&And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss.
id="t-354000"&&Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish.
id="t-360000"&&They become rarer because we fish them.
id="t-363000"&&Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. 

id="t-368000"&&And the question is, why do people accept this?
id="t-375000"&&Well because they don't know that it was different.
id="t-378000"&&And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different.
id="t-383000"&&And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented.
id="t-397000"&&For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it's not "scientific."
id="t-413000"&&So you have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past. 

id="t-426000"&&And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play.
id="t-431000"&&Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past.
id="t-438000"&&We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low.
id="t-445000"&&That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline. 

id="t-461000"&&How about the people who can't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example?
id="t-468000"&&There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation.
id="t-476000"&&This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
id="t-479000"&&There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago.
id="t-483000"&&And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like "Avatar."
id="t-75000"&&(Laughter) And if you think about "Avatar," if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery?
id="t-503000"&&Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost.
id="t-508000"&&And so my recommendation, it's the only one I will provide, is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater. 

id="t-517000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-519000"&&(Applause)
