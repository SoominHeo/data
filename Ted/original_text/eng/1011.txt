Hi.
Hi.
id="t-5000"&&It's true.
id="t-7000"&&So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
id="t-12000"&&We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
id="t-20000"&&But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.
id="t-28000"&&Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.
id="t-32000"&&But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.
id="t-36000"&&And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
id="t-41000"&&So how does it happen?
id="t-43000"&&Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.
id="t-49000"&&All right, let's go. 

(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God.
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God.
id="t-55000"&&Oh, my God!
id="t-58000"&&Wooo!
id="t-60000"&&Ohhhhh, wowwww! 

id="t-65000"&&KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
id="t-70000"&&In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.
id="t-80000"&&But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
id="t-83000"&&He just wanted to share a rainbow.
id="t-85000"&&Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
id="t-92000"&&And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.
id="t-97000"&&So what happened here?
id="t-99000"&&Jimmy Kimmel actually.
id="t-101000"&&Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
id="t-106000"&&Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience. 

(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.

id="t-126000"&&KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
id="t-131000"&&Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
id="t-134000"&&It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
id="t-75000"&&This is a chart of what it looked like.
id="t-139000"&&And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. 

id="t-145000"&&So what happened on this day?
id="t-147000"&&Well it was a Friday, this is true.
id="t-150000"&&And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) But what about this day, this one particular Friday?
id="t-162000"&&Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
id="t-165000"&&Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
id="t-171000"&&But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. 

id="t-178000"&&And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
id="t-185000"&&And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
id="t-188000"&&Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. 

id="t-207000"&&(Music) 

id="t-216000"&&So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music.
id="t-221000"&&It's this, just like this.
id="t-223000"&&It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
id="t-227000"&&And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) Even cats were watching this video.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) Cats were watching other cats watch this video. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-254000"&&But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
id="t-262000"&&There were remixes.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) Someone made an old timey version.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) And then it went international.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
id="t-296000"&&Because we don't just enjoy now, we participate. 

id="t-303000"&&And who could have predicted any of this?
id="t-305000"&&Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?"
id="t-309000"&&What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it?
id="t-314000"&&In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.
id="t-323000"&&When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested. 

id="t-331000"&&(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-353000"&&KA: By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times.
id="t-361000"&&And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively.
id="t-365000"&&And so it all brings us to one big question ... 

id="t-369000"&&(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
id="t-372000"&&Ohhhh.
id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-377000"&&KA: What does it mean?
id="t-380000"&&Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity.
id="t-392000"&&I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube.
id="t-398000"&&No one has to green-light your idea.
id="t-401000"&&And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.
id="t-405000"&&And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future. 

id="t-412000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-414000"&&(Applause)
