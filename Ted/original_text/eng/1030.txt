id="t-0"&&Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer -- if not personally, then through a loved one, a family member, colleague, friend.
id="t-10000"&&And once our lives are touched by cancer, we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons, or three tools, that are available to fight the disease: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
id="t-26000"&&And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions, again either personally or with our loved ones and family members, we also very quickly learn the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools. 

id="t-45000"&&I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool, a new tool, that we call Tumor Treating Fields.
id="t-57000"&&Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti, professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.
id="t-65000"&&And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer.
id="t-71000"&&To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work, we first need to understand what are electric fields. 

id="t-78000"&&Let me first address a few popular misconceptions.
id="t-84000"&&First of all, electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue.
id="t-91000"&&Electric fields are not ionizing radiation, like X-rays or proton beams, that bombard tissue to disrupt DNA.
id="t-101000"&&And electric fields are not magnetism.
id="t-105000"&&What electric fields are are a field of forces.
id="t-110000"&&And these forces act on, attract, bodies that have an electrical charge. 

id="t-118000"&&The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity.
id="t-122000"&&Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses.
id="t-127000"&&We can all picture astronauts in space.
id="t-130000"&&They float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them.
id="t-134000"&&But as that space shuttle returns to Earth, and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field, they begin to see the effects of gravity.
id="t-145000"&&They begin to be attracted towards Earth.
id="t-147000"&&And as they land, they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.
id="t-151000"&&We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.
id="t-154000"&&That's why you're all in your chairs.
id="t-157000"&&And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up, to walk around and to lift things. 

id="t-164000"&&In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
id="t-171000"&&We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station.
id="t-179000"&&And in that space station we have the genetic material, the chromosomes, within a nucleus.
id="t-186000"&&And out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions.
id="t-196000"&&Importantly, those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body.
id="t-204000"&&As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates, the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three-dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end-on-end to form chains.
id="t-225000"&&These chains then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells.
id="t-236000"&&And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells, two cancer cells become four cancer cells, and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. 

id="t-57000"&&Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station.
id="t-264000"&&And when that cellular space station is within the electric field, it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them.
id="t-275000"&&And it prevents them from forming those chains, those mitotic spindles, that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells.
id="t-285000"&&What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours.
id="t-290000"&&And they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide, programmed cell death, or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided.
id="t-305000"&&And we can observe this. 

id="t-307000"&&What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments.
id="t-311000"&&This is cultures, identical cultures, of cervical cancer cells.
id="t-316000"&&And we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains.
id="t-325000"&&The first clip shows a normal cell division without the Tumor Treating Fields.
id="t-333000"&&What we see are, first of all, a very active culture, a lot of divisions, and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated.
id="t-343000"&&And we can see them dividing throughout.
id="t-345000"&&When we apply the fields -- again, in the identical time-scale to the identical culture -- you're going to see something different.
id="t-353000"&&The cells round up for division, but they're very static in that position.
id="t-358000"&&We'll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide.
id="t-367000"&&The one within the circle manages.
id="t-369000"&&But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus, even in the dividing cell.
id="t-375000"&&The one up there can't divide at all.
id="t-377000"&&And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling, is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell. 

id="t-385000"&&Formation of healthy mitotic spindles is necessary for division in all cell types.
id="t-394000"&&We've applied Tumor Treating Fields to over 20 different cancers in the lab, and we see this effect in all of them.
id="t-404000"&&Now importantly, these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells. 

id="t-411000"&&10 years ago, Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients.
id="t-422000"&&In that time, Novocure's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.
id="t-432000"&&The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.
id="t-438000"&&GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year.
id="t-444000"&&It's a death sentence.
id="t-446000"&&The expected five year survival is less than five percent.
id="t-450000"&&And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year, and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again. 

id="t-467000"&&Novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent GBM.
id="t-473000"&&So these are patients who had received surgery, high dose radiation to the head and first-line chemotherapy, and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.
id="t-486000"&&We divided the patients into two groups.
id="t-489000"&&The first group received second-line chemotherapy, which is expected to double the life expectancy, versus no treatment at all.
id="t-497000"&&And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.
id="t-502000"&&What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group -- was the same.
id="t-513000"&&But importantly, the Tumor Treating Field group suffered none of the side effects typical of chemotherapy patients.
id="t-524000"&&They had no pain, suffered none of the infections.
id="t-529000"&&They had no nausea, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue that would be expected. 

id="t-537000"&&Based on this trial, in April of this year, the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM.
id="t-549000"&&Importantly, it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. 

id="t-561000"&&So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial.
id="t-569000"&&Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion.
id="t-573000"&&He won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit.
id="t-578000"&&And five years ago, Robert was diagnosed with GBM.
id="t-584000"&&He received the standard treatments.
id="t-586000"&&He received surgery.
id="t-589000"&&He received high dose radiation to the head.
id="t-592000"&&And he received first-line chemotherapy.
id="t-595000"&&A year after this treatment -- in fact, this is his baseline MRI.
id="t-600000"&&You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery.
id="t-607000"&&And a year after that treatment, his tumor grew back with a vengeance.
id="t-612000"&&That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. 

id="t-618000"&&At this point, he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live.
id="t-624000"&&He entered our trial.
id="t-626000"&&And here we can see him getting the therapy.
id="t-629000"&&First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.
id="t-632000"&&They're attached to the skin in the area of the tumor.
id="t-636000"&&Here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.
id="t-641000"&&The patients learn to do this themselves And then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life.
id="t-650000"&&There's none of the tiredness.
id="t-652000"&&There's none of what is called the "chemo head."
id="t-655000"&&There's no sensation.
id="t-657000"&&It doesn't interfere with computers or electrical equipment.
id="t-662000"&&And the therapy is delivered continuously at home, without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually. 

id="t-671000"&&These are Robert's MRIs, again, under only TTField treatment.
id="t-677000"&&This is a therapy that takes time to work.
id="t-680000"&&It's a medical device; it works when it's on.
id="t-684000"&&But what we can see is, by month six, the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away.
id="t-692000"&&It's still there.
id="t-694000"&&By month 12, we could argue whether there's a little bit of material around the edges, but it's essentially completely gone.
id="t-703000"&&It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis, and he's alive, but importantly, he's healthy and he's at work.
id="t-714000"&&I'm going to let him, in this very short clip, describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words. 

id="t-720000"&&(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life, I rate what I have today a bit different than what most people would assume.
id="t-728000"&&I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.
id="t-733000"&&And every single morning I appreciate life.
id="t-737000"&&Every night I fall asleep very well, and I am, I repeat, the happiest man in the world, and I'm thankful I am alive. 

id="t-750000"&&BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer as the second target.
id="t-755000"&&We've run a phase two trial in Switzerland on, again, recurrent patients -- patients who have received standard therapy and whose cancer has come back.
id="t-767000"&&I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia.
id="t-771000"&&Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer in Switzerland.
id="t-775000"&&She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago.
id="t-779000"&&She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years, none of which had an effect.
id="t-786000"&&Her cancer continued to grow.
id="t-788000"&&Three years ago, she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. 

id="t-794000"&&You can see, in her case, she's wearing her transducer arrays, one of the front of her chest, one on the back, and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.
id="t-804000"&&You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator, but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.
id="t-810000"&&She is managing her farm.
id="t-812000"&&She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.
id="t-815000"&&And when we talked to her, she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy, she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.
id="t-823000"&&Her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went.
id="t-827000"&&Now she can run all of the activities of her farm.
id="t-832000"&&It's only the beginning. 

id="t-834000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-841000"&&In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.
id="t-848000"&&There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit.
id="t-855000"&&We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.
id="t-862000"&&There's now a new research project underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis. 

id="t-868000"&&We have more trials planned for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
id="t-876000"&&And I firmly believe that in the next 10 years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.
id="t-891000"&&I'm also very hopeful that in the next decades, we will make big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease. 

id="t-903000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-834000"&&(Applause)
