id="t-0"&&I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement.
id="t-10000"&&And I've done this in three parts.
id="t-12000"&&So first I started with the mind.
id="t-15000"&&And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."
id="t-26000"&&And here's a little image of that.
id="t-28000"&&And this was an amazing year.
id="t-30000"&&It was really a fascinating journey.
id="t-32000"&&It was painful at times, especially for those around me.
id="t-37000"&&My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.
id="t-43000"&&So it had its downsides. 

id="t-47000"&&But after that, I decided to work on the spirit.
id="t-51000"&&As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all.
id="t-55000"&&I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) Not really.
id="t-64000"&&But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.
id="t-71000"&&So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.
id="t-74000"&&And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave.
id="t-80000"&&So this is what I looked like by the end.
id="t-83000"&&Thank you for that reaction.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.
id="t-91000"&&I got both of them.
id="t-93000"&&So there was the topiary there.
id="t-96000"&&And there's the sheep. 

id="t-99000"&&Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive.
id="t-108000"&&So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.
id="t-111000"&&And I just finished a couple of months ago.
id="t-113000"&&And I have to say, thank God.
id="t-115000"&&Because living so healthily was killing me.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling.
id="t-127000"&&I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.
id="t-131000"&&And they were telling me all the things I had to do.
id="t-135000"&&I had to eat right, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure.
id="t-142000"&&I wrote the book on a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book.
id="t-148000"&&I had to put on sunscreen.
id="t-150000"&&This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.
id="t-157000"&&And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.
id="t-159000"&&So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen.
id="t-163000"&&I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year.
id="t-167000"&&There was the washing of hands.
id="t-169000"&&I had to do that properly.
id="t-171000"&&And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs.
id="t-182000"&&So that took a lot of time. 

id="t-184000"&&I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's a part of health.
id="t-189000"&&I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.
id="t-193000"&&They started a public campaign that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."
id="t-198000"&&So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around.
id="t-205000"&&And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) Well yeah, I tried that.
id="t-216000"&&Now it's a little extreme, I admit.
id="t-218000"&&But if you think about this, this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving.
id="t-230000"&&So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. 

id="t-235000"&&So I finished, and it was a success in a sense.
id="t-239000"&&All of the markers went in the right direction.
id="t-242000"&&My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.
id="t-249000"&&So that was nice.
id="t-252000"&&And it was successful overall.
id="t-255000"&&But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy.
id="t-259000"&&I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family.
id="t-265000"&&And as Dan Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. 

id="t-271000"&&So I finished.
id="t-273000"&&And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over.
id="t-279000"&&I went to the dark side, and I just indulged myself.
id="t-283000"&&It was like something out of Caligula.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) Without the sex part.
id="t-289000"&&Because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening.
id="t-294000"&&But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.
id="t-297000"&&And I finally have stabilized.
id="t-302000"&&So now I'm back to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year.
id="t-313000"&&It was really a life-changing project.
id="t-316000"&&And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.
id="t-319000"&&Let me just tell you two really quickly. 

id="t-322000"&&The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now.
id="t-329000"&&Because we live in such a noisy world.
id="t-332000"&&There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response.
id="t-355000"&&A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.
id="t-358000"&&And this, over the years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.
id="t-364000"&&The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year.
id="t-369000"&&And it was done in Europe.
id="t-371000"&&And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution.
id="t-383000"&&So they think it's actually very deadly. 

id="t-386000"&&And by the way, it's also terrible for your brain.
id="t-391000"&&It really impairs cognition.
id="t-394000"&&And our Founding Fathers knew about this.
id="t-396000"&&When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate.
id="t-405000"&&So without noise reduction technology, our country would not exist.
id="t-411000"&&So as a patriot, I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. 

id="t-423000"&&And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health, that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.
id="t-446000"&&And just to give you one instance of this: food.
id="t-451000"&&The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.
id="t-461000"&&But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food.
id="t-465000"&&To give just one example, we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.
id="t-470000"&&So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds.
id="t-478000"&&And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos.
id="t-60000"&&(Laughter) And it has made me a healthier person. 

id="t-486000"&&So that is it.
id="t-488000"&&The book about it comes out in April.
id="t-490000"&&It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."
id="t-492000"&&And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.
id="t-494000"&&That's my greatest hope. 

id="t-496000"&&So thank you very much. 

id="t-498000"&&(Applause)
