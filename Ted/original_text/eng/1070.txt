id="t-1000"&&Let me introduce to you Rezero.
id="t-4000"&&This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich. 

id="t-12000"&&Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots.
id="t-16000"&&Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball.
id="t-20000"&&The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground.
id="t-25000"&&This means that the robot is inherently unstable.
id="t-29000"&&It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. 

id="t-32000"&&You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable?
id="t-36000"&&Now we'll explain that in a second.
id="t-38000"&&Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance.
id="t-42000"&&Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.
id="t-47000"&&He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately.
id="t-52000"&&This happens 160 times per second, and if anything fails in this process, Rezero would immediately fall to the ground. 

id="t-59000"&&Now to move and to balance, Rezero needs to turn the ball.
id="t-63000"&&The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time.
id="t-74000"&&Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion.
id="t-74000"&&Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion.
id="t-78000"&&It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically].
id="t-83000"&&Let's play a little.
id="t-85000"&&You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push.
id="t-92000"&&In this mode, he's trying to maintain his position. 

id="t-97000"&&For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael, on the computer, and Thomas who's helping me onstage.
id="t-107000"&&In the next mode, Rezero is passive, and we can move him around.
id="t-113000"&&With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity.
id="t-121000"&&I can also make him spin.
id="t-135000"&&In the next mode, we can get Rezero to follow a person.
id="t-140000"&&He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
id="t-147000"&&This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero.
id="t-155000"&&With the same method, we can also get him to circle a person.
id="t-162000"&&We call this the orbiting mode.
id="t-175000"&&All right, thank you, Thomas.
id="t-177000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-181000"&&Now, what's the use of this technology?
id="t-187000"&&For now, it's an experiment, but let me show you some possible future applications.
id="t-193000"&&Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
id="t-195000"&&With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.
id="t-200000"&&In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.
id="t-204000"&&Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.
id="t-209000"&&And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these.
id="t-214000"&&And these are more practical applications.
id="t-216000"&&But there's also a certain beauty within this technology. 

id="t-220000"&&(Music) 

id="t-177000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-284000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-177000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-284000"&&Thank you.
