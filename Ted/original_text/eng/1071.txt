id="t-1000"&&I want to talk to you about something kind of big.
id="t-6000"&&We'll start here.
id="t-9000"&&65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) A chunk of rock six miles across, moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet, slammed into the Earth.
id="t-27000"&&It released its energy all at once, and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing.
id="t-33000"&&If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War, lumped them together and blew them up at the same time, that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment.
id="t-47000"&&The dinosaurs had a really bad day.
id="t-50000"&&Okay? 

id="t-52000"&&Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
id="t-54000"&&We all live here in Boulder.
id="t-56000"&&If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak, you're probably familiar with it.
id="t-60000"&&Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space.
id="t-60000"&&Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space.
id="t-60000"&&Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space.
id="t-60000"&&Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space.
id="t-60000"&&Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space.
id="t-72000"&&Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, okay?
id="t-76000"&&We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left.
id="t-80000"&&It hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.
id="t-84000"&&You can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. 

id="t-90000"&&Here is how big of a crater was left.
id="t-90000"&&Here is how big of a crater was left.
id="t-90000"&&Here is how big of a crater was left.
id="t-90000"&&Here is how big of a crater was left.
id="t-90000"&&Here is how big of a crater was left.
id="t-114000"&&It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.
id="t-118000"&&Now, not all asteroids are that big.
id="t-121000"&&Some of them are smaller.
id="t-123000"&&Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992.
id="t-130000"&&It came in on a Friday night.
id="t-132000"&&Why is that important?
id="t-134000"&&Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular, and people would bring them, parents would bring them, to their kids' football games to film their kids play football.
id="t-134000"&&Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular, and people would bring them, parents would bring them, to their kids' football games to film their kids play football.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-157000"&&Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater, but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here, about the size of a football, that hit that car and did that damage.
id="t-168000"&&Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in.
id="t-172000"&&It broke up through atmospheric pressure, it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage.
id="t-178000"&&Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head, because it would do that to it.
id="t-182000"&&That would be bad.
id="t-184000"&&But it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine.
id="t-184000"&&But it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine.
id="t-193000"&&There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona, there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. 

id="t-207000"&&To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.
id="t-210000"&&If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot, and those are recreational vehicles right there.
id="t-216000"&&So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.
id="t-219000"&&The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here.
id="t-228000"&&It came in at speeds that were tremendous, slammed into the ground, blew up, and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb -- a very hefty bomb.
id="t-239000"&&This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope, or something like that out in the desert, but it probably would not have caused global devastation. 

id="t-250000"&&It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage.
id="t-255000"&&Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region -- for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters," when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got the date wrong, but that's okay.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) It was 1908.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) It was 1908.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) It was 1908.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground, several miles up above the surface of the Earth.
id="t-283000"&&The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles, okay?
id="t-294000"&&This did a huge amount of damage.
id="t-296000"&&And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. 

id="t-300000"&&In Meteor Crater it was made of metal, and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground.
id="t-306000"&&The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.
id="t-306000"&&The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.
id="t-315000"&&Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage.
id="t-320000"&&They're not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did.
id="t-324000"&&They're just not big enough.
id="t-326000"&&But they will do global economic damage, because they don't have to hit, necessarily, to do this kind of damage.
id="t-332000"&&They don't have to do global devastation.
id="t-334000"&&If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic.
id="t-338000"&&But if it came over a city, an important city -- not that any city is more important than others, but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. 

id="t-352000"&&So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ... (Laughter) what can we do about this?
id="t-352000"&&So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ... (Laughter) what can we do about this?
id="t-359000"&&This is a potential threat.
id="t-361000"&&Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years.
id="t-361000"&&Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years.
id="t-368000"&&The smaller ones happen more often, but probably on the order of a millennium, every few centuries or every few thousand years, but it's still something to be aware of.
id="t-378000"&&Well, what do we do about them?
id="t-380000"&&The first thing we have to do is find them.
id="t-382000"&&This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.
id="t-386000"&&It's right here.
id="t-388000"&&But you can see that it's extremely faint.
id="t-390000"&&I don't even know if you can see that in the back row.
id="t-390000"&&I don't even know if you can see that in the back row.
id="t-394000"&&This is a rock that was about 30 yards across, so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago. 

id="t-401000"&&These things are faint.
id="t-403000"&&They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
id="t-405000"&&We have to find these things first.
id="t-407000"&&Well the good news is, we're looking for them.
id="t-409000"&&NASA has devoted money to this.
id="t-411000"&&The National Science Foundation, other countries are very interested in doing this.
id="t-415000"&&We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
id="t-415000"&&We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
id="t-415000"&&We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
id="t-415000"&&We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
id="t-425000"&&You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis.
id="t-425000"&&You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis.
id="t-430000"&&If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis, because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. 

id="t-439000"&&Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.
id="t-442000"&&It's roughly 250 yards across, so it's pretty big -- big size, you know, bigger than a football stadium -- and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029.
id="t-452000"&&And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.
id="t-458000"&&The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right, if it passes through this region of space, this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13, which is a Friday, I'll note, in the year 2036 ... (Laughter) -- you can't plan that kind of stuff -- Apophis is going to hit us.
id="t-458000"&&The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right, if it passes through this region of space, this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13, which is a Friday, I'll note, in the year 2036 ... (Laughter) -- you can't plan that kind of stuff -- Apophis is going to hit us.

id="t-486000"&&Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly -- very, very low odds, so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.
id="t-496000"&&I don't think Apophis is a problem.
id="t-498000"&&In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise, because it woke us up to the dangers of these things.
id="t-504000"&&This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now.
id="t-508000"&&It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.
id="t-508000"&&It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.

id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-520000"&&Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you?
id="t-528000"&&But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid.
id="t-532000"&&And it turns out, we've even done it.
id="t-534000"&&In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
id="t-543000"&&Comets are very much like asteroids.
id="t-545000"&&The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way.
id="t-547000"&&The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet, which we learned quite a bit about.
id="t-555000"&&We did move the comet a little tiny bit, not very much, but that wasn't the point.
id="t-559000"&&However, think about this.
id="t-561000"&&This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second, 20 miles per second.
id="t-561000"&&This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second, 20 miles per second.
id="t-50000"&&Okay?
id="t-567000"&&Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
id="t-570000"&&That means we can do it again. 

id="t-573000"&&If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, and it's headed right for us, and we have two years to go, boom!
id="t-573000"&&If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, and it's headed right for us, and we have two years to go, boom!
id="t-580000"&&You can try to -- you know, if you watch the movies, you might think about, why don't we use a nuclear weapon?
id="t-586000"&&It's like, well, you can try that, but the problem is timing.
id="t-588000"&&You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing, you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it.
id="t-594000"&&And there are a lot of other problems with that.
id="t-594000"&&And there are a lot of other problems with that.
id="t-594000"&&And there are a lot of other problems with that.
id="t-594000"&&And there are a lot of other problems with that.
id="t-600000"&&I think even NASA can do that, and they proved that they can.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 

Well, my opinion is, fine.
id="t-50000"&&Okay?
id="t-50000"&&Okay?
id="t-50000"&&Okay?
id="t-618000"&&Now we have three years to do something else.
id="t-618000"&&Now we have three years to do something else.
id="t-618000"&&Now we have three years to do something else.
id="t-618000"&&Now we have three years to do something else.
id="t-627000"&&And this is the part, it's the part I just love.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM!
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM!
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

id="t-655000"&&These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts, like I said, engineers.
id="t-659000"&&Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
id="t-659000"&&Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
id="t-659000"&&Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
id="t-659000"&&Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
id="t-659000"&&Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
id="t-683000"&&It doesn't have to be huge -- couple of tons, not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid.
id="t-689000"&&You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end.
id="t-689000"&&You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end.
id="t-693000"&&Instead you get near it. 

id="t-695000"&&The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe, and the probe has a couple of tons of mass.
id="t-700000"&&It has a little tiny bit of gravity, but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid, and you have your rockets set up, so you can -- oh, you can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes -- and you basically, these guys are connected by their own gravity, and if you move the probe very slowly, very, very gently, you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit.
id="t-720000"&&You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it, although that's a whole other thing.
id="t-720000"&&You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it, although that's a whole other thing.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) But we'd be rich!
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-735000"&&So think about this, right?
id="t-737000"&&There are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us, and they're doing damage to us, but we've figured out how to do this, and all the pieces are in place to do this.
id="t-746000"&&We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them.
id="t-746000"&&We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them.
id="t-757000"&&This probe actually can't use chemical rockets.
id="t-759000"&&Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push.
id="t-759000"&&Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push.

id="t-763000"&&We invented something called an ion drive, which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.
id="t-768000"&&It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand, incredibly light, but it can run for months and years, providing that very gentle push.
id="t-778000"&&If anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek," they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive, and Spock said, "They're very technically sophisticated.
id="t-786000"&&They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."
id="t-786000"&&They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) We don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now.
id="t-794000"&&(Applause) Spock.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-802000"&&So ... that's the difference, that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs.
id="t-808000"&&This happened to them.
id="t-810000"&&It doesn't have to happen to us.
id="t-812000"&&The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote, and so we can change our future.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) We have the ability to change our future.
id="t-826000"&&65 million years from now, we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.
id="t-832000"&&Thank you very much.
id="t-794000"&&(Applause)
