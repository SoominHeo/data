id="t-24000"&&What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.
id="t-33000"&&The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.
id="t-37000"&&Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.
id="t-44000"&&I find weather extremely fascinating.
id="t-46000"&&Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.
id="t-50000"&&So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible. 

id="t-56000"&&All of my work begins very simple.
id="t-58000"&&I extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices -- generally anything I can find in the hardware store.
id="t-66000"&&I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.
id="t-74000"&&That's both historical as well as real data.
id="t-76000"&&And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.
id="t-79000"&&These clipboards are filled with numbers.
id="t-81000"&&And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables.
id="t-85000"&&That begins my translation process. 

id="t-87000"&&My translation medium is a very simple basket.
id="t-90000"&&A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.
id="t-94000"&&When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form.
id="t-102000"&&I use natural reed, because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control.
id="t-108000"&&That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me.
id="t-112000"&&What I come up with are forms like these.
id="t-114000"&&These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data.
id="t-118000"&&Every colored bead, every colored string, represents a weather element.
id="t-122000"&&And together, these elements, not only construct the form, but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph. 

id="t-130000"&&When you step closer, you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers.
id="t-134000"&&The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day.
id="t-138000"&&So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.
id="t-141000"&&But it's also used to assign a temperature range.
id="t-143000"&&On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings, water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.
id="t-149000"&&I also translate weather data into musical scores.
id="t-152000"&&And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. 

id="t-159000"&&So all of these scores are made up of weather data.
id="t-161000"&&Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element.
id="t-165000"&&And together, these variables construct a score.
id="t-168000"&&I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.
id="t-170000"&&This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum.
id="t-176000"&&Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score. 

id="t-193000"&&What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
id="t-200000"&&This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.
id="t-204000"&&You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
id="t-206000"&&You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.
id="t-211000"&&You place it in a music hall, it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.
id="t-215000"&&And I really like that, because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. 

id="t-223000"&&The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science.
id="t-230000"&&And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.
id="t-232000"&&So for me, that was my way into it. 

id="t-234000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-236000"&&(Applause)
