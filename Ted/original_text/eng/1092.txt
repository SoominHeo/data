id="t-0"&&I'd like to take you to another world.
id="t-4000"&&And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day.
id="t-18000"&&I went to a very elitist, snobbish, expensive education in India, and that almost destroyed me.
id="t-31000"&&I was all set to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor -- all laid out.
id="t-40000"&&Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) The whole world was laid out for me.
id="t-50000"&&Everything was at my feet.
id="t-52000"&&I could do nothing wrong.
id="t-55000"&&And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. 

id="t-61000"&&So in 1965, I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India, and I saw starvation, death, people dying of hunger, for the first time.
id="t-73000"&&It changed my life.
id="t-76000"&&I came back home, told my mother, "I'd like to live and work in a village."
id="t-83000"&&Mother went into a coma.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) "What is this?
id="t-90000"&&The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village?
id="t-95000"&&I mean, is there something wrong with you?"
id="t-97000"&&I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.
id="t-99000"&&It made me think.
id="t-101000"&&And I wanted to give something back in my own way."
id="t-106000"&&"What do you want to do in a village?
id="t-108000"&&No job, no money, no security, no prospect."
id="t-112000"&&I said, "I want to live and dig wells for five years."
id="t-117000"&&"Dig wells for five years?
id="t-119000"&&You went to the most expensive school and college in India, and you want to dig wells for five years?"
id="t-124000"&&She didn't speak to me for a very long time, because she thought I'd let my family down. 

id="t-133000"&&But then, I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have, which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified, respected, applied on a large scale.
id="t-147000"&&And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor.
id="t-151000"&&What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.
id="t-157000"&&I went to this village for the first time.
id="t-159000"&&Elders came to me and said, "Are you running from the police?"
id="t-163000"&&I said, "No."
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) "You failed in your exam?"
id="t-163000"&&I said, "No."
id="t-163000"&&I said, "No."
id="t-163000"&&I said, "No."
id="t-176000"&&"What are you doing here?
id="t-178000"&&Why are you here?
id="t-180000"&&The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich; what are you doing in this village?
id="t-187000"&&Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"
id="t-190000"&&I said, "No, I want to actually start a college only for the poor.
id="t-151000"&&What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."

id="t-198000"&&So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
id="t-202000"&&They said, "Please, don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college."
id="t-209000"&&So it's the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come.
id="t-217000"&&You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college.
id="t-225000"&&You have to work with your hands.
id="t-227000"&&You have to have a dignity of labor.
id="t-229000"&&You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community.
id="t-235000"&&So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism. 

id="t-240000"&&Who is a professional?
id="t-242000"&&A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief.
id="t-249000"&&A water diviner is a professional.
id="t-252000"&&A traditional midwife is a professional.
id="t-256000"&&A traditional bone setter is a professional.
id="t-259000"&&These are professionals all over the world.
id="t-261000"&&You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.
id="t-265000"&&And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal.
id="t-273000"&&It needs to be used, needs to be applied, needs to be shown to the world outside -- that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today. 

id="t-283000"&&So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.
id="t-289000"&&You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.
id="t-293000"&&There are no contracts, no written contracts.
id="t-295000"&&You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.
id="t-298000"&&And no one can get more than $100 a month.
id="t-301000"&&You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.
id="t-304000"&&You come for the work and the challenge, you'll come to the Barefoot College.
id="t-308000"&&That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
id="t-311000"&&Whatever idea you have, come and try it.
id="t-313000"&&It doesn't matter if you fail.
id="t-315000"&&Battered, bruised, you start again.
id="t-318000"&&It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher.
id="t-324000"&&And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.
id="t-327000"&&You are certified by the community you serve.
id="t-330000"&&You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer. 

id="t-337000"&&So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible.
id="t-337000"&&So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible.
id="t-342000"&&This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
id="t-346000"&&So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986.
id="t-352000"&&It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq.
id="t-352000"&&It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq.
id="t-363000"&&They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.
id="t-366000"&&But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.
id="t-369000"&&I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints, but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."
id="t-376000"&&We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000, because they didn't believe us, and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. 

id="t-388000"&&I asked a forester -- high-powered, paper-qualified expert -- I said, "What can you build in this place?"
id="t-388000"&&I asked a forester -- high-powered, paper-qualified expert -- I said, "What can you build in this place?"
id="t-388000"&&I asked a forester -- high-powered, paper-qualified expert -- I said, "What can you build in this place?"
id="t-398000"&&Not even worth it.
id="t-400000"&&No water, rocky soil."
id="t-402000"&&I was in a bit of a spot.
id="t-404000"&&And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"
id="t-409000"&&He looked quietly at me and said, "You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."
id="t-413000"&&This is what it looks like today. 

id="t-417000"&&Went to the roof, and all the women said, "Clear out.
id="t-421000"&&The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.
id="t-424000"&&This is waterproofing the roof."
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know.
id="t-433000"&&But it actually doesn't leak.
id="t-435000"&&Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.
id="t-438000"&&This technology, the women will not share with the men. 

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-444000"&&It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified.
id="t-450000"&&All the power comes from the sun.
id="t-452000"&&45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
id="t-454000"&&And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.
id="t-456000"&&So long as the sun shines, we'll have no problem with power.
id="t-460000"&&But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college.
id="t-474000"&&He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. 

id="t-482000"&&Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked.
id="t-487000"&&But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker.
id="t-499000"&&It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
id="t-505000"&&Unfortunately, they're almost half German, they're so precise.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) You'll never find Indian women so precise.
id="t-517000"&&Absolutely to the last inch, they can make that cooker.
id="t-521000"&&And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking. 

id="t-525000"&&We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.
id="t-530000"&&She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children.
id="t-536000"&&Barefoot technology: this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.
id="t-544000"&&Very little water is wasted.
id="t-546000"&&All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank, and no water is wasted.
id="t-552000"&&If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus, because we collect rainwater. 

id="t-557000"&&60 percent of children don't go to school, because they have to look after animals -- sheep, goats -- domestic chores.
id="t-566000"&&So we thought of starting a school at night for the children.
id="t-571000"&&Because the night schools of Tilonia, over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
id="t-576000"&&Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher.
id="t-580000"&&And what do we teach in these schools?
id="t-582000"&&Democracy, citizenship, how you should measure your land, what you should do if you're arrested, what you should do if your animal is sick.
id="t-593000"&&This is what we teach in the night schools.
id="t-595000"&&But all the schools are solar-lit. 

id="t-598000"&&Every five years we have an election.
id="t-602000"&&Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process, and they elect a prime minister.
id="t-613000"&&The prime minister is 12 years old.
id="t-617000"&&She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening.
id="t-622000"&&She has a cabinet, a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.
id="t-627000"&&And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children.
id="t-634000"&&She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago, and she went to Sweden.
id="t-638000"&&First time ever going out of her village.
id="t-640000"&&Never seen Sweden.
id="t-643000"&&Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
id="t-645000"&&And the Queen of Sweden, who's there, turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?
id="t-650000"&&She's only 12 years old, and she's not dazzled by anything."
id="t-655000"&&And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-666000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-674000"&&Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry.
id="t-681000"&&Puppets is the way we communicate.
id="t-690000"&&You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
id="t-690000"&&You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
id="t-690000"&&You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
id="t-690000"&&You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
id="t-690000"&&You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
id="t-702000"&&He's my donor.
id="t-704000"&&He actually raises money, solves my disputes.
id="t-709000"&&He solves my problems in the village.
id="t-712000"&&If there's tension in the village, if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent, the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says, "Shake hands.
id="t-723000"&&The attendance must not drop."
id="t-727000"&&These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports. 

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-666000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-740000"&&So this decentralized, demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages, we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan -- all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained.
id="t-759000"&&And we went to Ladakh, and we asked this woman -- this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof, because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman, "What was the benefit you had from solar electricity?"
id="t-775000"&&And she thought for a minute and said, "It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-784000"&&Went to Afghanistan.
id="t-786000"&&One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) Men are restless, men are ambitious, men are compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate.
id="t-821000"&&So we came up with a great solution: train grandmothers.
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-828000"&&What's the best way of communicating in the world today?
id="t-838000"&&Tell a woman. 

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-666000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-847000"&&So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."
id="t-847000"&&So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."
id="t-847000"&&So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."
id="t-847000"&&So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."
id="t-847000"&&So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."
id="t-859000"&&So I took the husbands along.
id="t-861000"&&Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.
id="t-864000"&&In six months, how do we train these women?
id="t-869000"&&Sign language.
id="t-871000"&&You don't choose the written word.
id="t-874000"&&You don't choose the spoken word.
id="t-876000"&&You use sign language.
id="t-879000"&&And in six months they can become solar engineers.
id="t-885000"&&They go back and solar-electrify their own village. 

id="t-888000"&&This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village, set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan [was] by the three women.
id="t-901000"&&This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.
id="t-905000"&&55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.
id="t-910000"&&And they haven't collapsed.
id="t-913000"&&She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC.
id="t-920000"&&He didn't know.
id="t-922000"&&Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan. 

id="t-928000"&&We went to Africa, and we did the same thing.
id="t-933000"&&All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries, all chatting to each other, not understanding a word, because they're all speaking a different language.
id="t-941000"&&But their body language is great.
id="t-943000"&&They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers.
id="t-947000"&&I went to Sierra Leone, and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village.
id="t-955000"&&Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"
id="t-958000"&&They said, "These two grandmothers ... " "Grandmothers?"
id="t-958000"&&They said, "These two grandmothers ... " "Grandmothers?"
id="t-958000"&&They said, "These two grandmothers ... " "Grandmothers?"
id="t-958000"&&They said, "These two grandmothers ... " "Grandmothers?"
id="t-966000"&&Went straight to the president.
id="t-968000"&&He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
id="t-968000"&&He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
id="t-968000"&&He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
id="t-973000"&&"What's the story."
id="t-975000"&&So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"
id="t-979000"&&I said, "I can't, Mr. President.
id="t-979000"&&I said, "I can't, Mr. President.
id="t-979000"&&I said, "I can't, Mr. President.
id="t-983000"&&So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.
id="t-986000"&&And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. 

id="t-990000"&&Gambia: we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.
id="t-995000"&&Went to this village.
id="t-997000"&&I knew which woman I would like to take.
id="t-999000"&&The community got together and said, "Take these two women."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1002000"&&I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
id="t-1009000"&&"Difficult husband; not possible."
id="t-1011000"&&Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand.
id="t-1011000"&&Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand.
id="t-1011000"&&Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand.
id="t-1011000"&&Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand.
id="t-1019000"&&I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."
id="t-1021000"&&"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"
id="t-1023000"&&That was his biggest fear.
id="t-1023000"&&That was his biggest fear.
id="t-1023000"&&That was his biggest fear.
id="t-1028000"&&She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger.
id="t-1033000"&&She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.
id="t-1038000"&&She handled the national press, and she was a star.
id="t-1043000"&&And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
id="t-1043000"&&And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
id="t-1043000"&&And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) Success story. 

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-666000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1057000"&&I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.
id="t-1067000"&&Look for solutions within.
id="t-1067000"&&Look for solutions within.
id="t-1067000"&&Look for solutions within.
id="t-1072000"&&They're all over the world.
id="t-1074000"&&Don't even worry.
id="t-1076000"&&Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.
id="t-1079000"&&They have all the solutions in the world. 

id="t-1082000"&&I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.
id="t-1085000"&&"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win."

id="t-1093000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-666000"&&(Applause)
