id="t-4000"&&What's in the box?
id="t-7000"&&Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment. 

id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-17000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-20000"&&Sound familiar?
id="t-23000"&&Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago?
id="t-29000"&&Three times.
id="t-32000"&&So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.
id="t-38000"&&Nope.
id="t-40000"&&There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq.
id="t-40000"&&There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq.
id="t-47000"&&So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space.
id="t-55000"&&So where does this lead?
id="t-57000"&&Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years. 

id="t-67000"&&Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more.
id="t-73000"&&I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less: college -- in your dorm, traveling -- in a hotel room, camping -- rig up basically nothing, maybe a boat.
id="t-88000"&&Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things, this gave you a little more freedom, a little more time.
id="t-96000"&&So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint.
id="t-102000"&&It's actually a great way to save you some money.
id="t-104000"&&And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. 

id="t-107000"&&So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area.

id="t-122000"&&I wanted it all -- home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear.
id="t-131000"&&With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.
id="t-131000"&&With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.
id="t-131000"&&With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.
id="t-145000"&&Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint.
id="t-153000"&&And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there. 

id="t-161000"&&So how can you live little?
id="t-163000"&&Three main approaches.
id="t-165000"&&First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.
id="t-168000"&&We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.
id="t-171000"&&And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?
id="t-174000"&&It's time for me to let it go.
id="t-176000"&&We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.
id="t-182000"&&We need to think before we buy.
id="t-184000"&&Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier?
id="t-184000"&&Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier?
id="t-189000"&&By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff.
id="t-193000"&&But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. 

id="t-198000"&&Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy.
id="t-202000"&&We want space efficiency.
id="t-204000"&&We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event.
id="t-210000"&&Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three?
id="t-214000"&&So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.
id="t-219000"&&You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear -- it's magic. 

id="t-226000"&&Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed -- same space, a little side table stretches out to seat 10.
id="t-240000"&&In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.
id="t-247000"&&Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10.
id="t-253000"&&My office folds away, easily hidden.
id="t-257000"&&My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.
id="t-257000"&&My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.
id="t-257000"&&My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.
id="t-265000"&&And of course, my own movie theater. 

id="t-268000"&&So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq.
id="t-268000"&&So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq.
id="t-272000"&&But consider the benefits of an edited life.
id="t-275000"&&Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000.
id="t-280000"&&Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags, maybe a small space, a hotel room.
id="t-288000"&&So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, "Could I do with a little life editing?
id="t-295000"&&Would that give me a little more freedom?
id="t-297000"&&Maybe a little more time?"

id="t-4000"&&What's in the box?
id="t-304000"&&It doesn't really matter.
id="t-307000"&&I know I don't need it.
id="t-310000"&&What's in yours?
id="t-312000"&&Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.
id="t-316000"&&So let's make room for the good stuff. 

id="t-320000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-17000"&&(Applause)
