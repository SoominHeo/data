id="t-0"&&I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana, West Africa.
id="t-7000"&&Ghana felt safe to me as a child.
id="t-9000"&&I was free, I was happy.
id="t-13000"&&The early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.
id="t-18000"&&But then by the end of the decade, the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement. 

id="t-27000"&&In 1979, I witnessed my first military coup.
id="t-33000"&&We the children had gathered at a friend's house.
id="t-36000"&&It was a dimly lit shack.
id="t-38000"&&There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background, and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole.
id="t-49000"&&The firing squad aimed, fired -- the general was dead.
id="t-54000"&&Now this was being broadcast live.
id="t-57000"&&And shortly after, we left the country, and we returned to Switzerland. 

id="t-62000"&&Now Europe came as a shock to me, and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in.
id="t-71000"&&I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.
id="t-73000"&&I think it was a tactic of survival.
id="t-76000"&&And it worked, or so I believed. 

id="t-79000"&&So here I was in 2008 wondering where I was in my life.
id="t-87000"&&And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.
id="t-90000"&&I was always playing the exotic African.
id="t-93000"&&I was playing the violent African, the African terrorist.
id="t-97000"&&And I was thinking, how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?
id="t-104000"&&And I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me.
id="t-110000"&&And fortunately I decided in 2008 to return to Ghana, after 28 years of absence.
id="t-118000"&&I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections.
id="t-123000"&&And there, I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood.
id="t-128000"&&And before I even knew it, I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally. 

id="t-136000"&&And I realized that, when I'd left the country, free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream.
id="t-144000"&&And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality.
id="t-97000"&&And I was thinking, was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity?
id="t-155000"&&Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me?
id="t-161000"&&And it was as if through the standards of my Western life, I hadn't lived up to my full potential.
id="t-170000"&&I mean, nor had Ghana, even though we had been trying very hard. 

id="t-174000"&&Now in 1957, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence.
id="t-180000"&&In the late 50s, Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.
id="t-185000"&&I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not.
id="t-191000"&&But maybe it was time to prove to myself, yes, it's important to understand the past, it is important to look at it in a different light, but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present. 

id="t-208000"&&So here I was, December 7th, 2008.
id="t-213000"&&The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM, but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands, were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.
id="t-225000"&&And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far, because they wanted to make their voices heard.
id="t-230000"&&And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"
id="t-233000"&&And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
id="t-236000"&&He said that his vote was in his heart.
id="t-239000"&&And I understood, this was their election, and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them. 

id="t-246000"&&Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner -- so nobody had achieved the absolute majority -- so voting went into a second round three weeks later.
id="t-256000"&&The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.
id="t-259000"&&The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.
id="t-261000"&&The heat was on.
id="t-263000"&&And then the cliche came to haunt us.
id="t-268000"&&There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations, of ballot boxes being stolen.
id="t-276000"&&Inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control.
id="t-282000"&&We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.
id="t-286000"&&People were being beaten brutally.
id="t-286000"&&People were being beaten brutally.
id="t-286000"&&People were being beaten brutally.
id="t-292000"&&It was complete chaos.
id="t-294000"&&And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again.
id="t-298000"&&Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself.
id="t-303000"&&And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings. 

id="t-310000"&&So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered, it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob, and I didn't believe what I was hearing.
id="t-319000"&&They were chanting, "We want peace.
id="t-321000"&&We want peace."
id="t-324000"&&And I realized it had to come from the people.
id="t-327000"&&After all, they decide, and they did.
id="t-331000"&&So the sounds that were before distorted and loud, were suddenly a melody.
id="t-338000"&&The sounds of the voices were harmonious.
id="t-341000"&&So it could happen.
id="t-344000"&&A democracy could be upheld peacefully.
id="t-347000"&&It could be, by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace. 

id="t-356000"&&Now here's an interesting comparison.
id="t-359000"&&We in the West, we preach the values, the golden light of democracy, that we are the shining example of how it's done.
id="t-369000"&&But when it comes down to it, Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- Bush versus Gore.
id="t-383000"&&But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide, Ghana honored democracy and its people.
id="t-394000"&&It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide; the people did. 

id="t-400000"&&Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either.
id="t-405000"&&I mean, it was so incredibly close.
id="t-407000"&&The electoral commissioner declared, with the consent of the parties, to run an unprecedented second re-run.
id="t-416000"&&So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president, not the legal system.
id="t-424000"&&And guess what, it worked.
id="t-428000"&&The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.
id="t-435000"&&I mean, at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy, they did not abuse their power.
id="t-444000"&&The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep, proving that the African is capable of governing himself. 

id="t-453000"&&Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over, but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists, and that we must not take it for granted.
id="t-465000"&&Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa, and I'm still searching for my identity, but I saw Ghana create democracy better.
id="t-480000"&&Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently.
id="t-487000"&&And yes, we Africans can. 

id="t-491000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-493000"&&(Applause)
