id="t-0"&&My name is Kate Hartman.
id="t-7000"&&And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.
id="t-13000"&&So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
id="t-37000"&&I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.
id="t-41000"&&And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. 

id="t-46000"&&And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.
id="t-52000"&&And it's pretty simple.
id="t-55000"&&Everybody's got one -- all of you.
id="t-57000"&&I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies.
id="t-65000"&&Don't be ashamed.
id="t-67000"&&It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
id="t-72000"&&And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within. 

id="t-84000"&&So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.
id="t-89000"&&So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.
id="t-94000"&&And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat.
id="t-101000"&&And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.
id="t-108000"&&And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
id="t-111000"&&And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
id="t-124000"&&And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
id="t-127000"&&And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else. 

id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-145000"&&So I make other hats as well.
id="t-147000"&&This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) It's fairly self-explanatory.
id="t-153000"&&It physically carves out conversation space for one.
id="t-157000"&&And when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.
id="t-175000"&&So what happens when a person puts this thing on?
id="t-178000"&&What kind of an experience do they have?
id="t-180000"&&And how are they transformed by wearing it? 

id="t-186000"&&So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
id="t-191000"&&So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
id="t-194000"&&And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication.
id="t-213000"&&And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
id="t-220000"&&So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions.
id="t-225000"&&So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.
id="t-237000"&&So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.
id="t-260000"&&So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say. 

id="t-267000"&&So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.
id="t-275000"&&And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.
id="t-285000"&&And I thought, "Well, hey!
id="t-287000"&&Maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
id="t-291000"&&So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
id="t-295000"&&And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. 

id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-305000"&&And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
id="t-318000"&&So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.
id="t-325000"&&And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. 

id="t-337000"&&And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course.
id="t-345000"&&And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) Because there seems to be an issue.
id="t-359000"&&The glaciers are actually leaving us.
id="t-361000"&&They're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether. 

id="t-365000"&&And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
id="t-370000"&&And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
id="t-377000"&&They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier. 

id="t-383000"&&And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.
id="t-387000"&&When I meet a glacier for the very first time, what do I do?
id="t-393000"&&There's no kind of social protocol for this.
id="t-397000"&&I really just don't even know how to say hello.
id="t-401000"&&Do I carve a message in the snow?
id="t-404000"&&Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code.
id="t-410000"&&Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.
id="t-418000"&&But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship. 

id="t-424000"&&And I was really struck by how much it affected me.
id="t-427000"&&This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.
id="t-434000"&&And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
id="t-28000"&&(Laughter) And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
id="t-453000"&&And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug. 

id="t-463000"&&So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
id="t-465000"&&These are initial musings for this project.
id="t-467000"&&And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
id="t-474000"&&And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations. 

id="t-494000"&&So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. 

id="t-516000"&&Thanks. 

id="t-518000"&&(Applause)
