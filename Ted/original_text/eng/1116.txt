id="t-0"&&My topic is economic growth in China and India.
id="t-5000"&&And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth.
id="t-15000"&&You may say this is not fair, because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy.
id="t-23000"&&Actually, exactly the opposite is what I'm going to do.
id="t-28000"&&I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy, rather than against democracy. 

id="t-36000"&&The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India.
id="t-42000"&&Over the last 30 years, in terms of the GDP growth rates, China has grown at twice the rate of India.
id="t-51000"&&In the last five years, the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth.
id="t-58000"&&But over the last 30 years, China undoubtedly has done much better than India.
id="t-65000"&&One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.
id="t-70000"&&Look at the skyline of Shanghai.
id="t-73000"&&This is the Pudong area.
id="t-75000"&&The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India.
id="t-81000"&&The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law.
id="t-89000"&&It can plan for the long-term benefits of the country and in the process, evict millions of people -- that's just a small technical issue.
id="t-100000"&&Whereas in India, you cannot do that, because you have to listen to the public.
id="t-105000"&&You're being constrained by the public's opinion.
id="t-107000"&&Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view.
id="t-112000"&&In an interview printed in the financial press of India, He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai.
id="t-121000"&&This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values, and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai. 

id="t-134000"&&So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth, that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development: infrastructures, airports, highways, bridges, things like that.
id="t-148000"&&And you need a strong government to do that, because you cannot respect private property rights.
id="t-154000"&&You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.
id="t-157000"&&You need also state ownership, especially of land assets, in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly.
id="t-167000"&&The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth, rather than a facilitator of economic growth.
id="t-177000"&&Here's the key question.
id="t-179000"&&Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth?
id="t-184000"&&This is a key issue.
id="t-186000"&&If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth, then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth.
id="t-195000"&&If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe, then you will put less emphasis on strong government. 

id="t-204000"&&So to illustrate that question, let me give you two countries.
id="t-208000"&&And for the sake of brevity, I'll call one country Country 1 and the other country Country 2.
id="t-214000"&&Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures.
id="t-214000"&&Country 1 has more telephones, and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.
id="t-227000"&&So if I were to ask you, "Which is China and which is India, and which country has grown faster?"
id="t-236000"&&if you believe in the infrastructure view, then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.
id="t-242000"&&They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.
id="t-244000"&&And Country 2 is possibly India."

id="t-248000"&&Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union, and the data referred to 1989.
id="t-256000"&&After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones, the country collapsed.
id="t-264000"&&That's not too good.
id="t-266000"&&The picture there is Khrushchev.
id="t-268000"&&I know that in 1989 he no longer ruled the Soviet Union, but that's the best picture that I can find.
id="t-275000"&&(Laughter) Telephones, infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth.
id="t-281000"&&Country 2, that has fewer telephones, is China.
id="t-286000"&&Since 1989, the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years.
id="t-293000"&&If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones, you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. 

id="t-214000"&&Country 1, that has a longer system of railways, is actually India.
id="t-310000"&&And Country 2 is China.
id="t-313000"&&This is a very little known fact about the two countries.
id="t-318000"&&Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India.
id="t-322000"&&But for many years, until the late 1990s, China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis India.
id="t-330000"&&In developing countries, the most common mode of transportation is the railways, and the British built a lot of railways in India.
id="t-340000"&&India is the smaller of the two countries, and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s.
id="t-348000"&&So clearly, infrastructure doesn't explain why China did better before the late 1990s, as compared with India. 

id="t-357000"&&In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide, the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
id="t-368000"&&The economy grows, government accumulates more resources, and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth.
id="t-380000"&&And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth.
id="t-385000"&&Let me look at this question more directly.
id="t-387000"&&Is democracy bad for economic growth?
id="t-390000"&&Now let's turn to two countries, Country A and Country B.
id="t-395000"&&Country A, in 1990, had about $300 per capita GDP as compared with Country B, which had $460 in per capita GDP.
id="t-405000"&&By 2008, Country A has surpassed Country B with $700 per capita GDP as compared with $650 per capita GDP.
id="t-417000"&&Both countries are in Asia. 

id="t-419000"&&If I were to ask you, "Which are the two Asian countries?
id="t-423000"&&And which one is a democracy?"
id="t-425000"&&you may argue, "Well, maybe Country A is China and Country B is India."
id="t-431000"&&In fact, Country A is democratic India, and Country B is Pakistan -- the country that has a long period of military rule.
id="t-442000"&&And it's very common that we compare India with China.
id="t-448000"&&That's because the two countries have about the same population size.
id="t-453000"&&But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan.
id="t-457000"&&Those two countries are geographically similar.
id="t-460000"&&They have a complicated, but shared common history.
id="t-464000"&&By that comparison, democracy looks very, very good in terms of economic growth. 

id="t-471000"&&So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments?
id="t-477000"&&One reason is the East Asian Model.
id="t-479000"&&In East Asia, we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
id="t-488000"&&Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the 60s and 70s and 1980s.
id="t-496000"&&The problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries, "Have you won the lottery?"
id="t-504000"&&And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."
id="t-506000"&&And then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are 100 percent.
id="t-513000"&&The reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn't end up winning the prize. 

id="t-523000"&&For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia, there's a matched failure.
id="t-531000"&&Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.
id="t-534000"&&Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.
id="t-537000"&&Burma didn't succeed.
id="t-539000"&&The Philippines didn't succeed.
id="t-541000"&&If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide, there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth.
id="t-554000"&&So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias -- it is known as selecting on a dependent variable, something we always tell our students to avoid. 

id="t-565000"&&So exactly why did China grow so much faster?
id="t-570000"&&I will take you to the Cultural Revolution, when China went mad, and compare that country's performance with India under Indira Gandhi.
id="t-579000"&&The question there is: Which country did better, China or India?
id="t-584000"&&China was during the Cultural Revolution.
id="t-586000"&&It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution, China out-perfomed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about 2.2 percent every year in terms of per capita GDP.
id="t-598000"&&So that's when China was mad.
id="t-600000"&&The whole country went mad.
id="t-603000"&&It must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution.
id="t-614000"&&The advantage the country had was human capital -- nothing else but human capital. 

id="t-621000"&&This is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s.
id="t-627000"&&And this is the earliest data that I can find.
id="t-630000"&&The adult literacy rate in China is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in India.
id="t-638000"&&The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women.
id="t-646000"&&I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.
id="t-650000"&&In China, the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters.
id="t-658000"&&In India, the definition of literacy, operating definition of literacy, is the ability, the grand ability, to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak.
id="t-672000"&&The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated.
id="t-679000"&&If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index, that data series, go back to the early 1970s, you see exactly the same contrast.
id="t-690000"&&China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis India. 

id="t-696000"&&Life expectancies: as early as 1965, China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.
id="t-704000"&&On average, as a Chinese in 1965, you lived 10 years more than an average Indian.
id="t-711000"&&So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian, you would want to become a Chinese in order to live 10 years longer.
id="t-720000"&&If you made that decision in 1965, the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
id="t-726000"&&So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. 

id="t-731000"&&If you cannot chose your nationality, then you will want to become an Indian man.
id="t-737000"&&Because, as an Indian man, you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis-a-vis Indian women.
id="t-745000"&&This is an extremely strange fact.
id="t-748000"&&It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern.
id="t-753000"&&It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women.
id="t-760000"&&The good news is, by 2006, India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy.
id="t-769000"&&Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men.
id="t-774000"&&So India is reverting to the normal.
id="t-777000"&&But India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality. 

id="t-781000"&&These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India.
id="t-789000"&&In China, it's all women.
id="t-791000"&&60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country, whereas in India, it's all men.
id="t-799000"&&Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."
id="t-807000"&&By looking at these two pictures, I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.
id="t-813000"&&If you look at other East Asian countries, women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take-off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia.
id="t-826000"&&India still has a long way to go to catch up with China. 

id="t-830000"&&Then the issue is, what about the Chinese political system?
id="t-834000"&&You talk about human capital, you talk about education and public health.
id="t-838000"&&What about the political system?
id="t-840000"&&Isn't it true that the one-party political system has facilitated economic growth in China?
id="t-847000"&&Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.
id="t-851000"&&It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system.
id="t-859000"&&Statically, China is a one-party system, authoritarian -- there's no question about it.
id="t-865000"&&Dynamically, it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic.
id="t-871000"&&When you explain change -- for example, economic growth; economic growth is about change -- when you explain change, you use other things that have changed to explain change, rather than using the constant to explain change.
id="t-886000"&&Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change, but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. 

id="t-895000"&&In terms of the political changes, they have introduced village elections.
id="t-899000"&&They have increased the security of proprietors.
id="t-903000"&&And they have increased the security with long-term land leases.
id="t-908000"&&There are also financial reforms in rural China.
id="t-911000"&&There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
id="t-914000"&&To me, the pace of political changes is too slow, too gradual.
id="t-919000"&&And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges, because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.
id="t-927000"&&But nevertheless, the system has moved in a more liberal direction, moved in a more democratic direction. 

id="t-936000"&&You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
id="t-940000"&&In fact, when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth -- about one percent, two percent a year -- that was when India was least democratic.
id="t-949000"&&Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
id="t-953000"&&The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations.
id="t-958000"&&A little-known fact about India in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms, the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self-rule, privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts.
id="t-979000"&&So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. 

id="t-985000"&&Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster?
id="t-991000"&&One reason is they are always comparing India with China.
id="t-996000"&&But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth.
id="t-1000000"&&If you are a NBA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan, you're going to look not so impressive.
id="t-1007000"&&But that doesn't mean that you're a bad basketball player.
id="t-1011000"&&Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark.
id="t-1015000"&&In fact, if you compare India with the average developing country, even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth -- now India is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period, India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies.
id="t-1035000"&&This is a very impressive record indeed. 

id="t-1039000"&&Let's think about the future: the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.
id="t-1044000"&&Which country has the growth momentum?
id="t-1047000"&&China, I believe, still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital, the public health, the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India.
id="t-1061000"&&But I believe that India has the momentum.
id="t-1063000"&&It has the improving fundamentals.
id="t-1065000"&&The government has invested in basic education, has invested in basic health.
id="t-1070000"&&I believe the government should do more, but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in is the right direction.
id="t-1076000"&&India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth, whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. 

id="t-1085000"&&I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth.
id="t-1091000"&&And it's very important to have political reforms, to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.
id="t-1096000"&&I don't know whether that's going to happen or not, but I'm an optimist.
id="t-1100000"&&Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China. 

id="t-1105000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-1107000"&&(Applause)
