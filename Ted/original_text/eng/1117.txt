id="t-0"&&Hi everyone.
id="t-2000"&&I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.
id="t-5000"&&Thank you.
id="t-7000"&&And I want to share with you my latest art project.
id="t-10000"&&It's a children's book for the iPad.
id="t-13000"&&It's a little quirky and silly.
id="t-15000"&&It's called "Pop-It," And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. 

id="t-20000"&&(Music) 

id="t-22000"&&So this is about potty training -- as most of you, I hope, know.
id="t-27000"&&You can tickle the rug.
id="t-29000"&&You can make the baby poop.
id="t-31000"&&You can do all those fun things.
id="t-35000"&&You can burst bubbles.
id="t-39000"&&You can draw, as everyone should. 

id="t-43000"&&But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda.
id="t-47000"&&At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.
id="t-50000"&&It's not the way I was brought up.
id="t-53000"&&So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."
id="t-55000"&&If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.
id="t-60000"&&You don't like it?
id="t-62000"&&Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
id="t-71000"&&You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. 

id="t-74000"&&I have to tell you about my childhood.
id="t-76000"&&I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.
id="t-82000"&&Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am.
id="t-86000"&&And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.
id="t-95000"&&Basically, I celebrated every religious function.
id="t-98000"&&In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
id="t-103000"&&I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani.
id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan.
id="t-113000"&&It was a very beautiful time. 

id="t-115000"&&But I must say, I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.
id="t-120000"&&Babri Masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century -- was demolished by Hindu activists.
id="t-129000"&&This caused major riots in my city.
id="t-131000"&&And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest.
id="t-137000"&&My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags.
id="t-137000"&&My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags.
id="t-137000"&&My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags.
id="t-147000"&&I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) He's like, "Huh!"

id="t-153000"&&You know, my work is inspired by events such as this.
id="t-158000"&&Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life.
id="t-168000"&&Imagine history being taught differently. 

id="t-170000"&&Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?
id="t-174000"&&I have another idea.
id="t-175000"&&It's a children's book about Indian independence -- very patriotic.
id="t-180000"&&But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
id="t-182000"&&Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. 

id="t-185000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-190000"&&You have to separate fact from bias, right.
id="t-192000"&&Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals.
id="t-196000"&&But they're playing geopolitics.
id="t-198000"&&They're playing out Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan.
id="t-202000"&&You know, I'm making a very important argument.
id="t-204000"&&And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage.
id="t-214000"&&After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.
id="t-219000"&&And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. 

id="t-229000"&&I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy.
id="t-234000"&&You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. 

id="t-243000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-185000"&&(Applause)
