id="t-0"&&What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we're going to make matter come alive.
id="t-8000"&&Now this may seem a bit ambitious, but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands, you realize that you're alive.
id="t-14000"&&So this is a start.
id="t-16000"&&Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.
id="t-19000"&&There's been four billion years of organic, biological life.
id="t-23000"&&And as an inorganic chemist, my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic, living world and the inorganic, dead world.
id="t-32000"&&And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter into living matter, into inorganic biology. 

id="t-42000"&&Before we do that, I want to kind of put biology in its place.
id="t-47000"&&And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.
id="t-49000"&&I love to do synthetic biology.
id="t-51000"&&I love things that are alive.
id="t-53000"&&I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.
id="t-55000"&&But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution.
id="t-63000"&&And evolution, although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people, evolution still is a little bit intangible.
id="t-73000"&&And when I talk about Darwinian evolution, I mean one thing and one thing only, and that is survival of the fittest.
id="t-79000"&&And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way.
id="t-83000"&&Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing, and some winning. 

id="t-89000"&&So bearing that in mind, as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology: What is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution?
id="t-101000"&&And this seems quite a profound question.
id="t-103000"&&And as a chemist, we're not used to profound questions every day.
id="t-107000"&&So when I thought about it, then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer.
id="t-113000"&&And in fact, the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is, in fact, a single cell -- a bacteria. 

id="t-121000"&&So this raises three really important questions: What is life?
id="t-126000"&&Is biology special?
id="t-128000"&&Biologists seem to think so.
id="t-130000"&&Is matter evolvable?
id="t-132000"&&Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable?
id="t-132000"&&Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable?

id="t-146000"&&So here's some inorganic life.
id="t-148000"&&This is a dead crystal, and I'm going to do something to it, and it's going to become alive.
id="t-154000"&&And you can see, it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.
id="t-159000"&&This is an inorganic tube.
id="t-161000"&&And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.
id="t-165000"&&Of course, they're not alive.
id="t-167000"&&It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.
id="t-170000"&&But when I saw this, I was really fascinated, because it seemed lifelike.
id="t-175000"&&And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.
id="t-180000"&&You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.
id="t-183000"&&And this is dead.
id="t-185000"&&So I was positive that, if somehow we can make things mimic life, let's go one step further.
id="t-191000"&&Let's see if we can actually make life. 

id="t-193000"&&But there's a problem, because up until maybe a decade ago, we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.
id="t-202000"&&In fact, we were the only people in the universe.
id="t-206000"&&Now, that's a bit boring.
id="t-208000"&&So as a chemist, I wanted to say, "Hang on.
id="t-208000"&&So as a chemist, I wanted to say, "Hang on.
id="t-212000"&&Is life that improbable?"
id="t-214000"&&And this is really the question.
id="t-217000"&&I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars.
id="t-223000"&&And in fact, let's take that one step further.
id="t-226000"&&Let's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe, maybe the physics of life is as well.
id="t-234000"&&And so the problem with chemists -- and this is a massive advantage as well -- is we like to focus on our elements.
id="t-240000"&&In biology, carbon takes center stage.
id="t-243000"&&And in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology, then we have all this wonderful diversity of life.
id="t-250000"&&In fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.
id="t-254000"&&We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards. 

id="t-258000"&&Well what about matter?
id="t-260000"&&If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?
id="t-263000"&&So think, this is a serious question.
id="t-265000"&&If your pen could replicate, that would be a bit of a problem.
id="t-270000"&&So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive.
id="t-274000"&&And we also have to be aware of the issues.
id="t-276000"&&But before we can make life, let's think for a second what life really is characterized by.
id="t-282000"&&And forgive the complicated diagram.
id="t-284000"&&This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.
id="t-287000"&&And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing.
id="t-291000"&&Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.
id="t-294000"&&Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.
id="t-297000"&&And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.
id="t-299000"&&You have regulation; information is transcribed; catalysts are made; stuff is happening.
id="t-305000"&&But what does a cell do?
id="t-307000"&&Well it divides, it competes, it survives.
id="t-311000"&&And I think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life. 

id="t-317000"&&But what else is life characterized by?
id="t-319000"&&Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle.
id="t-323000"&&And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating, metabolizing, burning through chemistries.
id="t-331000"&&And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow.
id="t-338000"&&So before we can really start to make life, we have to really think about where it came from.
id="t-343000"&&And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere -- maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa, maybe somewhere else.
id="t-354000"&&But the real honest answer is, we just don't know, because there is a problem with the origin.
id="t-360000"&&Imagine way back, four and a half billion years ago, there is a vast chemical soup of stuff.
id="t-365000"&&And from this stuff we came. 

id="t-367000"&&So when you think about the improbable nature of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes, just remember, we came from stuff on planet Earth.
id="t-376000"&&And we went through a variety of worlds.
id="t-379000"&&The RNA people would talk about the RNA world.
id="t-382000"&&We somehow got to proteins and DNA.
id="t-384000"&&We then got to the last ancestor.
id="t-386000"&&Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.
id="t-389000"&&And here we are.
id="t-391000"&&But there's a roadblock that you can't get past.
id="t-394000"&&You can decode the genome, you can look back, you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA, but we can't get further than the last ancestor, the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history.
id="t-408000"&&So we don't know how we got here. 

id="t-411000"&&So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God, or my friend.
id="t-411000"&&So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God, or my friend.
id="t-411000"&&So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God, or my friend.
id="t-426000"&&I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.
id="t-429000"&&The other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity.
id="t-433000"&&This seems most likely.
id="t-435000"&&So we have some kind of primordial soup.
id="t-437000"&&And this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids.
id="t-441000"&&And somehow these amino acids are combined, and life begins.
id="t-447000"&&But life begins, what does that mean?
id="t-124000"&&What is life?
id="t-124000"&&What is life?

id="t-452000"&&So in the 1950s, Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment, where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.
id="t-461000"&&They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through.
id="t-468000"&&And they had a look at what was in the soup, and they found amino acids, but nothing came out, there was no cell.
id="t-475000"&&So the whole area's been stuck for a while, and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. 

id="t-484000"&&In my own laboratory, the way we're trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats.
id="t-491000"&&So what we're trying to do is do reactions -- not in one flask, but in tens of flasks, and connect them together, as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.
id="t-499000"&&We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically, we can do it in a 3D printer, we can do it in droplets for colleagues.
id="t-506000"&&And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away.
id="t-511000"&&But that's probably going to end in failure, so we need to be a bit more focused. 

id="t-517000"&&And the answer, of course, lies with mice.
id="t-519000"&&This is how I remember what I need as a chemist.
id="t-522000"&&I say, "Well I want molecules."
id="t-524000"&&But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.
id="t-527000"&&I need some information, and I need a container.
id="t-530000"&&Because if I want evolution, I need containers to compete.
id="t-534000"&&So if you have a container, it's like getting in your car.
id="t-538000"&&"This is my car, and I'm going to drive around and show off my car."
id="t-542000"&&And I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life.
id="t-548000"&&So these things together give us evolution, perhaps.
id="t-551000"&&And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. 

id="t-555000"&&So what we're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.
id="t-560000"&&And so forgive the molecules on the screen, but these are a very simple kit.
id="t-564000"&&There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.
id="t-566000"&&And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano-molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins, but there's no carbon in sight.
id="t-577000"&&Carbon is banned.
id="t-579000"&&And so with this Lego kit, we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA.
id="t-588000"&&But we need to make some containers.
id="t-590000"&&And just a few months ago in my lab, we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.
id="t-595000"&&And you can see on the screen a cell being made.
id="t-598000"&&And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.
id="t-601000"&&And all I wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes, in real cells, and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism, a molecular survival of the fittest. 

id="t-613000"&&And this movie here shows this competition between molecules.
id="t-617000"&&Molecules are competing for stuff.
id="t-619000"&&They're all made of the same stuff, but they want their shape to win.
id="t-623000"&&They want their shape to persist.
id="t-625000"&&And that is the key.
id="t-627000"&&If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete, they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete.
id="t-636000"&&If we manage to do that, forget the molecular detail. 

id="t-641000"&&Let's zoom out to what that could mean.
id="t-643000"&&So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology, to us.
id="t-648000"&&If we could get evolution into the material world, then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.
id="t-654000"&&And that's really worth thinking about.
id="t-657000"&&Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe?
id="t-662000"&&Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete?
id="t-667000"&&So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution.
id="t-674000"&&So you imagine, if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form, not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive; it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies, because we can then use software control for evolution to code in. 

id="t-694000"&&So imagine we make a little cell.
id="t-696000"&&We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun.
id="t-700000"&&What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
id="t-700000"&&What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
id="t-700000"&&What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
id="t-706000"&&We should take our inspiration from biology.
id="t-708000"&&Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works.
id="t-712000"&&So this will reorganize the way we design things.
id="t-716000"&&But not only just that, we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.
id="t-723000"&&Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?
id="t-732000"&&The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything, because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.
id="t-740000"&&Evolution cannot be cut apart.
id="t-743000"&&You need to somehow find the fitness function.
id="t-746000"&&And the profound realization for me is that, if this works, the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level, and we really start talking about selfish matter. 

id="t-756000"&&And what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff?
id="t-761000"&&You're sitting on chairs.
id="t-763000"&&They're inanimate, they're not alive.
id="t-765000"&&But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff, and you enslave stuff.
id="t-769000"&&So using evolution in biology, and in inorganic biology, for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.
id="t-777000"&&And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive.
id="t-785000"&&And again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is, remember, five billion years ago, we were not here, and there was no life.
id="t-793000"&&So what will that tell us 

id="t-795000"&&about the origin of life and the meaning of life?
id="t-798000"&&But perhaps, for me as a chemist, I want to keep away from general terms; I want to think about specifics.
id="t-804000"&&So what does it mean about defining life?
id="t-806000"&&We really struggle to do this.
id="t-808000"&&And I think, if we can make inorganic biology, and we can make matter become evolvable, that will in fact define life.
id="t-815000"&&I propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive, and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. 

id="t-823000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-825000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-832000"&&Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.
id="t-836000"&&You believe you're going to be successful in this project?
id="t-838000"&&When? 

id="t-840000"&&Lee Cronin: So many people think that life took millions of years to kick in.
id="t-844000"&&We're proposing to do it in just a few hours, once we've set up the right chemistry. 

id="t-851000"&&CA: And when do you think that will happen? 

id="t-853000"&&LC: Hopefully within the next two years. 

id="t-856000"&&CA: That would be a big story.
id="t-858000"&&(Laughter) In your own mind, what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non-carbon-based life, walking or oozing or something? 

id="t-868000"&&LC: I think it's 100 percent.
id="t-870000"&&Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology, if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.
id="t-875000"&&So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon, maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.
id="t-882000"&&Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff. 

CA: Lee Cronin, good luck.
CA: Lee Cronin, good luck.

id="t-825000"&&(Applause)
