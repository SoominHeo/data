id="t-0"&&So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys.
id="t-4000"&&Guys are flaming out academically; they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women.
id="t-10000"&&Other than that, there's not much of a problem.
id="t-13000"&&So what's the data?
id="t-15000"&&So the data on dropping out is amazing.
id="t-17000"&&Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school.
id="t-21000"&&In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.
id="t-24000"&&Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school to graduate school.
id="t-28000"&&There's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs, with guys falling behind girls.
id="t-28000"&&There's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs, with guys falling behind girls.
id="t-28000"&&There's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs, with guys falling behind girls.
id="t-40000"&&And as you all know, boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder -- and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. 

id="t-49000"&&What's the evidence of wiping out?
id="t-51000"&&First, it's a new fear of intimacy.
id="t-53000"&&Intimacy means physical, emotional connection with somebody else -- and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous, contradictory, phosphorescent signals.
id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) And every year there's research done on self-reported shyness among college students.
id="t-74000"&&And we're seeing a steady increase among males.
id="t-76000"&&And this is two kinds.
id="t-78000"&&It's a social awkwardness.
id="t-80000"&&The old shyness was a fear of rejection.
id="t-82000"&&It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.
id="t-84000"&&They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.
id="t-90000"&&They don't know the language of face contact, the non-verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else, listen to somebody else. 

id="t-100000"&&There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating.
id="t-108000"&&It turns out, from earliest childhood, boys, and then men, prefer the company of guys -- physical company.
id="t-116000"&&And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at, because guys have been with guys in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities, especially in the military, and then in pubs.
id="t-127000"&&And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers, watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.
id="t-139000"&&The problem is they now prefer [the] asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. 

What are the causes?
What are the causes?
id="t-150000"&&I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming, excessive new access to pornography.
id="t-157000"&&The problem is these are arousal addictions.
id="t-160000"&&Drug addiction, you simply want more.
id="t-162000"&&Arousal addiction, you want different.
id="t-164000"&&Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.
id="t-166000"&&So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. 

id="t-169000"&&And the problem is the industry is supplying it.
id="t-172000"&&Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21, he's played 10,000 hours of video games, most of that in isolation.
id="t-180000"&&As you remember, Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn.
id="t-187000"&&The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.
id="t-190000"&&And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.
id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually.
id="t-200000"&&For every 400 movies made in Hollywood, there are 11,000 now made porn videos. 

id="t-205000"&&So the effect, very quickly, is it's a new kind of arousal.
id="t-209000"&&Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.
id="t-215000"&&That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes, which are analog, static, interactively passive.
id="t-220000"&&They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships, which build gradually and subtly. 

So what's the solution?
So what's the solution?
So what's the solution?
So what's the solution?

id="t-65000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-233000"&&(Applause) 

But who should care?
But who should care?
But who should care?
But who should care?
