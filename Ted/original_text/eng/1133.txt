id="t-0"&&Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide?
id="t-7000"&&And these are base stations.
id="t-9000"&&And we also have more than five billion of these devices here.
id="t-15000"&&These are cellular mobile phones.
id="t-18000"&&And with these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month.
id="t-24000"&&This is a 6 with 14 zeroes -- a very large number.
id="t-28000"&&And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
id="t-28000"&&And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
id="t-28000"&&And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
id="t-41000"&&And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly, to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons.
id="t-50000"&&And it's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has, because it's so fundamental to our lives. 

id="t-59000"&&And one of the issues is capacity.
id="t-61000"&&The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular, radio waves.
id="t-67000"&&And radio waves are limited.
id="t-69000"&&They are scarce; they are expensive; and we only have a certain range of it.
id="t-75000"&&And it's this limitation that doesn't cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.
id="t-84000"&&And we are simply running out of spectrum.
id="t-86000"&&There's another problem.
id="t-88000"&&That is efficiency.
id="t-90000"&&These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations, consume a lot of energy.
id="t-95000"&&And mind you, most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves, it is used to cool the base stations.
id="t-102000"&&Then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent.
id="t-107000"&&And that creates a big problem.
id="t-110000"&&Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.
id="t-113000"&&You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights.
id="t-117000"&&In hospitals, they are security issues.
id="t-120000"&&And security is another issue.
id="t-123000"&&These radio waves penetrate through walls.
id="t-125000"&&They can be intercepted, and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions. 

id="t-132000"&&So these are the main four issues.
id="t-134000"&&But on the other hand, we have 14 billion of these: light bulbs, light.
id="t-141000"&&And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
id="t-144000"&&So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.
id="t-149000"&&You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.
id="t-151000"&&X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.
id="t-154000"&&Then there's ultraviolet light.
id="t-156000"&&it's good for a nice suntan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body.
id="t-160000"&&Infrared -- due to eye safety regulations, can be only used with low power.
id="t-166000"&&And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.
id="t-169000"&&And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.
id="t-172000"&&It's light, and light has been around for many millions of years.
id="t-176000"&&And in fact, it has created us, has created life, has created all the stuff of life.
id="t-183000"&&So it's inherently safe to use.
id="t-186000"&&And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications? 

id="t-190000"&&Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.
id="t-193000"&&I compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum.
id="t-199000"&&And guess what?
id="t-201000"&&We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum, which is there for us to use.
id="t-207000"&&So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum, let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.
id="t-212000"&&We have 1.4 million expensively deployed, inefficient radio cellular base stations.
id="t-219000"&&And multiply that by 10,000, then you end up at 14 billion.
id="t-223000"&&14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.
id="t-226000"&&So we have the infrastructure there.
id="t-228000"&&Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.
id="t-231000"&&Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs. 

id="t-233000"&&Can we use them for communications?
id="t-235000"&&Yes.
id="t-237000"&&What do we need to do?
id="t-239000"&&The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs, florescent lights, with this new technology of LED, LED light bulbs.
id="t-239000"&&The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs, florescent lights, with this new technology of LED, LED light bulbs.
id="t-239000"&&The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs, florescent lights, with this new technology of LED, LED light bulbs.
id="t-253000"&&And it has a very nice acute property.
id="t-257000"&&Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds, and it can be switched off at very high speeds.
id="t-265000"&&And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology.
id="t-272000"&&So let's show how we do that.
id="t-274000"&&Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum -- go to remote controls.
id="t-278000"&&You all know remote controls have an infrared LED -- basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.
id="t-283000"&&And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second, 20,000 bits per second.
id="t-290000"&&Not usable for a YouTube video. 

id="t-292000"&&What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb.
id="t-302000"&&We transmit with our technology, not only a single data stream, we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel, at even higher speeds.
id="t-312000"&&And the technology we have developed -- it's called SIM OFDM.
id="t-316000"&&And it's spacial modulation -- these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details -- but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data. 

id="t-328000"&&You will say, "Okay, this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes."
id="t-333000"&&But not only that.
id="t-335000"&&What we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator.
id="t-340000"&&And I'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator.
id="t-344000"&&And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp.
id="t-349000"&&We fit in an LED light bulb, worth three U.S. dollars, put in our signal processing technology.
id="t-356000"&&And then what we have here is a little hole.
id="t-359000"&&And the light goes through that hole.
id="t-361000"&&There's a receiver.
id="t-363000"&&The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal.
id="t-370000"&&And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream.
id="t-374000"&&In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones.
id="t-381000"&&And not only integrate a photo detector here, but maybe use the camera inside. 

id="t-388000"&&So what happens when I switch on that light?
id="t-395000"&&As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp.
id="t-399000"&&Put your book beneath it and you can read.
id="t-402000"&&It's illuminating the space.
id="t-404000"&&But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.
id="t-408000"&&And that's a video, a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam.
id="t-413000"&&You're critical.
id="t-415000"&&You think, "Ha, ha, ha.
id="t-417000"&&This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."
id="t-420000"&&But let me do this. 

id="t-424000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-429000"&&Once again.
id="t-432000"&&Still don't believe?
id="t-435000"&&It is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.
id="t-441000"&&And if you look at the light, it is illuminating as you would expect.
id="t-446000"&&You don't notice with your human eye.
id="t-448000"&&You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb.
id="t-454000"&&It's serving the purpose of illumination, but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.
id="t-459000"&&And you see, even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
id="t-464000"&&It can ignore that constant light, because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes.
id="t-474000"&&You also have a critical question now, and you say, "Okay, do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working?"
id="t-482000"&&And the answer is yes.
id="t-484000"&&But, you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off.
id="t-490000"&&And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible. 

id="t-493000"&&So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.
id="t-496000"&&Capacity: We have 10,000 times more spectrum, 10,000 times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there.
id="t-504000"&&You would agree with me, hopefully, there's no issue of capacity anymore.
id="t-508000"&&Efficiency: This is data through illumination -- it's first of all an illumination device.
id="t-514000"&&And if you do the energy budget, the data transmission comes for free -- highly energy efficient.
id="t-521000"&&I don't mention the high energy efficiency of these LED light bulbs.
id="t-525000"&&If the whole world would deploy them, you would save hundreds of power plants.
id="t-530000"&&That's aside. 

id="t-532000"&&And then I've mentioned the availability.
id="t-534000"&&You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.
id="t-537000"&&You need to see what to do.
id="t-539000"&&You have lights in an aircraft.
id="t-541000"&&So it's everywhere in a day there is light.
id="t-541000"&&So it's everywhere in a day there is light.
id="t-541000"&&So it's everywhere in a day there is light.
id="t-541000"&&So it's everywhere in a day there is light.
id="t-546000"&&It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.
id="t-548000"&&These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission. 

id="t-552000"&&And then there's security.
id="t-555000"&&You would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls.
id="t-560000"&&So no one, if I have a light here, if I have secure data, no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data.
id="t-568000"&&And there's only data where there is light.
id="t-571000"&&So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data, then what I could do, turn it away.
id="t-582000"&&So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.
id="t-584000"&&Now we can in fact see where the data is going to. 

id="t-590000"&&So for me, the applications of it, to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.
id="t-600000"&&We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.
id="t-604000"&&And you only have to notice, where we have light, there is a potential way to transmit data.
id="t-610000"&&But I can give you a few examples.
id="t-613000"&&Well you may see the impact already now.
id="t-617000"&&This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean.
id="t-621000"&&And they use light to illuminate space down there.
id="t-624000"&&And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [use] to communicate with each other. 

id="t-629000"&&Intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant -- you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks, but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.
id="t-639000"&&In hospitals, for new medical instruments; in streets for traffic control.
id="t-647000"&&Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights, and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information.
id="t-658000"&&Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.
id="t-661000"&&And then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world.
id="t-667000"&&And every street lamp could be a free access point.
id="t-669000"&&We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi, light-fidelity.
id="t-673000"&&And then we have these aircraft cabins.
id="t-677000"&&There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin, and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.
id="t-686000"&&So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home.
id="t-686000"&&So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home.
id="t-686000"&&So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home.

id="t-700000"&&So, all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device.
id="t-707000"&&And this would then combine two basic functionalities: illumination and wireless data transmission.
id="t-714000"&&And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days.
id="t-722000"&&And in the future, you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs, you may have 14 billion Li-Fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner, a greener, and even a brighter future. 

id="t-736000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-424000"&&(Applause)
