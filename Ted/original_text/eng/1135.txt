id="t-0"&&We are losing our listening.
id="t-3000"&&We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it.
id="t-9000"&&We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
id="t-11000"&&Now not you, not this talk, but that is generally true.
id="t-15000"&&Let's define listening as making meaning from sound.
id="t-19000"&&It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction. 

id="t-23000"&&We use some pretty cool techniques to do this.
id="t-25000"&&One of them is pattern recognition.
id="t-27000"&&(Crowd Noise) So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention," some of you just sat up.
id="t-34000"&&We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name.
id="t-40000"&&Differencing is another technique we use.
id="t-42000"&&If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes, you would literally cease to hear it.
id="t-47000"&&We listen to differences, we discount sounds that remain the same. 

id="t-52000"&&And then there is a whole range of filters.
id="t-55000"&&These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to.
id="t-60000"&&Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
id="t-64000"&&But they actually create our reality in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.
id="t-70000"&&Give you one example of that: Intention is very important in sound, in listening.
id="t-75000"&&When I married my wife, I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time.
id="t-81000"&&Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.
id="t-84000"&&(Laughter) But it's a great intention to have in a relationship. 

id="t-89000"&&But that's not all.
id="t-91000"&&Sound places us in space and in time.
id="t-94000"&&If you close your eyes right now in this room, you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces.
id="t-103000"&&And you're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro-noises you're receiving.
id="t-108000"&&And sound places us in time as well, because sound always has time embedded in it.
id="t-115000"&&In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future.
id="t-121000"&&So, "Sonority is time and meaning" -- a great quote. 

id="t-123000"&&I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.
id="t-126000"&&Why did I say that?
id="t-128000"&&Well there are a lot of reasons for this.
id="t-130000"&&First of all, we invented ways of recording -- first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well.
id="t-136000"&&The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.
id="t-141000"&&Secondly, the world is now so noisy, (Noise) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily, it's just hard to listen; it's tiring to listen.
id="t-153000"&&Many people take refuge in headphones, but they turn big, public spaces like this, shared soundscapes, into millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.
id="t-164000"&&In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody. 

id="t-167000"&&We're becoming impatient.
id="t-169000"&&We don't want oratory anymore, we want sound bites.
id="t-173000"&&And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously, I think -- by personal broadcasting.
id="t-179000"&&I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation, which is sadly very common, especially in the U.K. We're becoming desensitized.
id="t-188000"&&Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention.
id="t-193000"&&And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet, the subtle, the understated. 

id="t-200000"&&This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.
id="t-203000"&&This is not trivial.
id="t-205000"&&Because listening is our access to understanding.
id="t-208000"&&Conscious listening always creates understanding.
id="t-212000"&&And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all, is a very scary place indeed.
id="t-223000"&&So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises, tools you can take away with you, to improve your own conscious listening.
id="t-230000"&&Would you like that? 

(Audience: Yes.)
(Audience: Yes.)

id="t-234000"&&The first one is silence.
id="t-236000"&&Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again.
id="t-244000"&&If you can't get absolute silence, go for quiet, that's absolutely fine. 

id="t-249000"&&Second, I call this the mixer.
id="t-252000"&&(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear?
id="t-262000"&&How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?
id="t-265000"&&You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.
id="t-268000"&&How many birds am I hearing?
id="t-268000"&&How many birds am I hearing?
id="t-268000"&&How many birds am I hearing?
id="t-272000"&&It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. 

id="t-277000"&&Third, this exercise I call savoring, and this is a beautiful exercise.
id="t-281000"&&It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
id="t-283000"&&This, for example, is my tumble dryer.
id="t-286000"&&(Dryer) It's a waltz.
id="t-286000"&&(Dryer) It's a waltz.
id="t-286000"&&(Dryer) It's a waltz.
id="t-286000"&&(Dryer) It's a waltz.
id="t-291000"&&I love it.
id="t-293000"&&Or just try this one on for size.
id="t-295000"&&(Coffee grinder) Wow!
id="t-306000"&&So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention.
id="t-308000"&&I call that the hidden choir.
id="t-310000"&&It's around us all the time. 

id="t-312000"&&The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these, if you just take one thing away.
id="t-318000"&&This is listening positions -- the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to.
id="t-325000"&&This is playing with those filters.
id="t-327000"&&Do you remember, I gave you those filters at the beginning.
id="t-329000"&&It's starting to play with them as levers, to get conscious about them and to move to different places.
id="t-334000"&&These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use.
id="t-339000"&&There are many.
id="t-339000"&&There are many.
id="t-339000"&&There are many.

id="t-343000"&&And finally, an acronym.
id="t-345000"&&You can use this in listening, in communication.
id="t-348000"&&If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence.
id="t-360000"&&And RASA stands for Receive, which means pay attention to the person; Appreciate, making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "okay"; Summarize, the word "so" is very important in communication; and Ask, ask questions afterward. 

id="t-375000"&&Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
id="t-375000"&&Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
id="t-375000"&&Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
id="t-379000"&&That's too much to ask from most people.
id="t-382000"&&But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. 

id="t-402000"&&That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
id="t-402000"&&That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
id="t-402000"&&That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
id="t-410000"&&And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it. 

id="t-424000"&&Now I don't know how to do that, but this is TED, and I think the TED community is capable of anything.
id="t-431000"&&So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other, take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools, and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection, a world of understanding and a world of peace. 

id="t-445000"&&Thank you for listening to me today. 

id="t-447000"&&(Applause)
