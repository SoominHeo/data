id="t-0"&&It's the Second World War.
id="t-2000"&&A German prison camp.
id="t-5000"&&And this man, Archie Cochrane, is a prisoner of war and a doctor, and he has a problem.
id="t-17000"&&The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand.
id="t-28000"&&The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.
id="t-33000"&&But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.
id="t-36000"&&He doesn't know how to cure it.
id="t-38000"&&And he's operating in a hostile environment.
id="t-41000"&&And people do terrible things in wars.
id="t-43000"&&The German camp guards, they've got bored.
id="t-46000"&&They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun.
id="t-50000"&&On one particular occasion, one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory while it was full of prisoners.
id="t-58000"&&He said he heard suspicious laughter.
id="t-60000"&&And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor, was one of the first men in to clear up the mess.
id="t-67000"&&And one more thing: Archie was suffering from this illness himself. 

id="t-72000"&&So the situation seemed pretty desperate.
id="t-75000"&&But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person.
id="t-80000"&&He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp, and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market.
id="t-89000"&&Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.
id="t-92000"&&Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.
id="t-95000"&&It looks like crude oil.
id="t-97000"&&It tastes ... zesty.
id="t-101000"&&And importantly, it's a rich source of vitamin B12.
id="t-107000"&&So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups.
id="t-112000"&&He gives half of them vitamin C. He gives half of them vitamin B12.
id="t-117000"&&He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book.
id="t-122000"&&And after just a few days, it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness, marmite is the cure. 

id="t-132000"&&So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.
id="t-135000"&&Now you've got to imagine at the moment -- forget this photo, imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.
id="t-142000"&&He hasn't been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure.
id="t-145000"&&Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.
id="t-157000"&&And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated, and he vents his frustrations.
id="t-164000"&&And then he goes back to his quarters, breaks down and weeps because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.
id="t-175000"&&But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book and says to his colleagues, "This evidence is incontrovertible.
id="t-190000"&&If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners, it's a war crime."
id="t-195000"&&And the next morning, supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp, and the prisoners begin to recover. 

id="t-204000"&&Now I'm not telling you this story because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude, although Archie Cochrane is a dude.
id="t-212000"&&I'm not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy, although I think that would also be completely awesome.
id="t-224000"&&I'm telling you this story because Archie Cochrane, all his life, fought against a terrible affliction, and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies.
id="t-239000"&&And he had a name for it.
id="t-241000"&&He called it the God complex.
id="t-244000"&&Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.
id="t-248000"&&So the symptoms of the complex are, no matter how complicated the problem, you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution. 

id="t-261000"&&Now Archie was a doctor, so he hung around with doctors a lot.
id="t-265000"&&And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.
id="t-268000"&&Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor, but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists.
id="t-274000"&&I see it in our business leaders.
id="t-276000"&&I see it in the politicians we vote for -- people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world, are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works.
id="t-288000"&&And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about, the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. 

id="t-295000"&&Well let me give you an example.
id="t-297000"&&Imagine for a moment that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you, there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.
id="t-304000"&&You know Hans: the Mick Jagger of TED.
id="t-308000"&&(Laughter) And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics, these amazing animations.
id="t-314000"&&And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.
id="t-316000"&&But a typical Hans Rosling graph: think for a moment, not what it shows, but think instead about what it leaves out.
id="t-324000"&&So it'll show you GDP per capita, population, longevity, that's about it.
id="t-331000"&&So three pieces of data for each country -- three pieces of data.
id="t-335000"&&Three pieces of data is nothing.
id="t-337000"&&I mean, have a look at this graph. 

id="t-339000"&&This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.
id="t-341000"&&He's at MIT.
id="t-343000"&&Now you won't be able to understand a word of it, but this is what it looks like.
id="t-347000"&&Cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products, and he's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products.
id="t-361000"&&And it's wonderful, wonderful work.
id="t-363000"&&You show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.
id="t-366000"&&And I think it'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow.
id="t-371000"&&Brilliant work.
id="t-373000"&&Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works.
id="t-377000"&&And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. 

id="t-385000"&&Five thousand products -- that's still nothing.
id="t-385000"&&Five thousand products -- imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo's data.
id="t-396000"&&Imagine you had one second per product category.
id="t-400000"&&In about the length of this session, you would have counted all 5,000.
id="t-405000"&&Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.
id="t-405000"&&Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.
id="t-405000"&&Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.
id="t-413000"&&Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo, London or New York.
id="t-422000"&&It's even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.
id="t-427000"&&If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York -- there are 10 billion of them -- it would take you 317 years.
id="t-436000"&&This is how complex the economy we've created is.
id="t-439000"&&And I'm just counting toasters here.
id="t-441000"&&I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.
id="t-444000"&&The complexity here is unbelievable.
id="t-447000"&&And just a piece of context -- the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services.
id="t-453000"&&You could count them in five minutes. 

id="t-456000"&&So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.
id="t-459000"&&This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting.
id="t-464000"&&We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture, we can post some graphs, we get it, we understand how this works."
id="t-472000"&&And we don't.
id="t-474000"&&We never do.
id="t-476000"&&Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.
id="t-478000"&&I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world.
id="t-482000"&&We clearly can.
id="t-484000"&&But the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.
id="t-493000"&&And we have a problem-solving technique that works.
id="t-496000"&&Now you show me a successful complex system, and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error. 

id="t-505000"&&Here's an example.
id="t-507000"&&This baby was produced through trial and error.
id="t-511000"&&I realize that's an ambiguous statement.
id="t-514000"&&Maybe I should clarify it.
id="t-516000"&&This baby is a human body: it evolved.
id="t-519000"&&What is evolution?
id="t-521000"&&Over millions of years, variation and selection, variation and selection -- trial and error, trial and error.
id="t-532000"&&And it's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error.
id="t-536000"&&You could use it in an industrial context. 

id="t-538000"&&So let's say you wanted to make detergent.
id="t-540000"&&Let's say you're Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.
id="t-545000"&&How do you do it?
id="t-547000"&&Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.
id="t-550000"&&You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.
id="t-552000"&&You create a spray of detergent.
id="t-552000"&&You create a spray of detergent.
id="t-552000"&&You create a spray of detergent.
id="t-557000"&&It falls to the floor.
id="t-557000"&&It falls to the floor.
id="t-557000"&&It falls to the floor.
id="t-561000"&&You sell it at a supermarket.
id="t-563000"&&You make lots of money.
id="t-565000"&&How do you design that nozzle?
id="t-568000"&&It turns out to be very important.
id="t-571000"&&Now if you ascribe to the God complex, what you do is you find yourself a little God.
id="t-576000"&&You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist -- somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.
id="t-582000"&&And he will, or she will, calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.
id="t-588000"&&Now Unilever did this and it didn't work -- too complicated.
id="t-592000"&&Even this problem, too complicated. 

id="t-595000"&&But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error, variation and selection.
id="t-605000"&&You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.
id="t-611000"&&You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.
id="t-614000"&&You create 10 variations on that one.
id="t-614000"&&You create 10 variations on that one.
id="t-614000"&&You create 10 variations on that one.
id="t-619000"&&You try out 10 variations on that one.
id="t-621000"&&You see how this works, right?
id="t-623000"&&And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle.
id="t-627000"&&It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly.
id="t-632000"&&We have no idea why it works, no idea at all.
id="t-638000"&&And the moment you step back from the God complex -- let's just try to have a bunch of stuff; let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not -- you can solve your problem. 

id="t-647000"&&Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize.
id="t-654000"&&And we've heard a lot about how economies function.
id="t-657000"&&The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
id="t-661000"&&How did it become the world's greatest economy?
id="t-664000"&&I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy, but I think the most salient one is this: ten percent of American businesses disappear every year.
id="t-677000"&&That is a huge failure rate.
id="t-680000"&&It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.
id="t-682000"&&Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.
id="t-685000"&&Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans, and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.
id="t-693000"&&And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets -- (Laughter) if, of course, they haven't already done so.
id="t-704000"&&I sometimes wonder.
id="t-707000"&&But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence, this incredible performance of Western economies.
id="t-716000"&&It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.
id="t-719000"&&It's come through trial and error. 

id="t-721000"&&Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months, and people sometimes say to me, "Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.
id="t-729000"&&Obviously trial and error is very important.
id="t-731000"&&Obviously experimentation is very important.
id="t-733000"&&Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"

id="t-736000"&&So I say, okay, fine.
id="t-738000"&&You think it's obvious?
id="t-740000"&&I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.
id="t-750000"&&Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer.
id="t-755000"&&And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.
id="t-759000"&&And if you can't find the answers, you must be lazy or stupid.
id="t-763000"&&When schools stop doing that all the time, I will admit that, yes, it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.
id="t-769000"&&When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says, "I want to fix our health system.
id="t-776000"&&I want to fix our education system.
id="t-778000"&&I have no idea how to do it.
id="t-781000"&&I have half a dozen ideas.
id="t-781000"&&I have half a dozen ideas.
id="t-781000"&&I have half a dozen ideas.
id="t-786000"&&Then we'll test some other ideas out.
id="t-786000"&&Then we'll test some other ideas out.
id="t-786000"&&Then we'll test some other ideas out.
id="t-786000"&&Then we'll test some other ideas out.
id="t-786000"&&Then we'll test some other ideas out.

id="t-805000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-809000"&&Until then, until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex.
id="t-817000"&&Because it's so hard to admit our own fallibility.
id="t-822000"&&It's so uncomfortable.
id="t-824000"&&And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.
id="t-827000"&&There's this one trial he ran many years after World War II.
id="t-831000"&&He wanted to test out the question of, where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks?
id="t-840000"&&Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital, or should they recover at home?
id="t-846000"&&All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.
id="t-849000"&&They had the God complex in spades.
id="t-852000"&&They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients, and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. 

id="t-860000"&&Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.
id="t-862000"&&He ran his trial.
id="t-864000"&&And after the trial had been running for a little while, he gathered together all his colleagues around his table, and he said, "Well, gentlemen, we have some preliminary results.
id="t-874000"&&They're not statistically significant.
id="t-876000"&&But we have something.
id="t-879000"&&And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.
id="t-882000"&&It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home.
id="t-886000"&&They should be in hospital."
id="t-889000"&&And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.
id="t-889000"&&And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.
id="t-889000"&&And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.
id="t-897000"&&Shut it down at once."
id="t-899000"&&And there's this huge hubbub.
id="t-901000"&&Archie lets it die down.
id="t-903000"&&And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen, because when I gave you the table of results, I swapped the two columns around.
id="t-912000"&&It turns out your hospitals are killing people, and they should be at home.
id="t-916000"&&Would you like to close down the trial now, or should we wait until we have robust results?"
id="t-923000"&&Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room. 

id="t-928000"&&But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.
id="t-931000"&&And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say, "Here in my own little world, I am a god, I understand everything.
id="t-943000"&&I do not want to have my opinions challenged.
id="t-945000"&&I do not want to have my conclusions tested."
id="t-948000"&&It feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law.
id="t-953000"&&Cochrane understood that uncertainty, that fallibility, that being challenged, they hurt.
id="t-959000"&&And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.
id="t-963000"&&Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.
id="t-966000"&&It isn't easy.
id="t-968000"&&It's incredibly painful. 

id="t-970000"&&And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject, I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.
id="t-978000"&&So shortly after the war, this young man, Yutaka Taniyama, developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
id="t-987000"&&It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
id="t-994000"&&In fact, it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
id="t-998000"&&You prove one, you prove the other.
id="t-1002000"&&But it was always a conjecture.
id="t-1005000"&&Taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true.
id="t-1011000"&&And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958, Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.
id="t-1018000"&&His friend, Goro Shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.
id="t-1027000"&&He said, "He was not a very careful person as a mathematician.
id="t-1034000"&&He made a lot of mistakes.
id="t-1037000"&&But he made mistakes in a good direction.
id="t-1041000"&&I tried to emulate him, but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes."

id="t-1051000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-805000"&&(Applause)
