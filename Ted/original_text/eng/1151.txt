id="t-0"&&The Highline is an old, elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.
id="t-7000"&&And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave. And it became known as "Death Avenue" because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front, and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."
id="t-21000"&&But even with a cowboy, about one person a month was killed and run over.
id="t-27000"&&So they elevated it.
id="t-29000"&&They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.
id="t-32000"&&But with the rise of interstate trucking, it was used less and less.
id="t-36000"&&And by 1980, the last train rode.
id="t-39000"&&It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district.
id="t-43000"&&And then it was abandoned. 

id="t-45000"&&And I live in the neighborhood, and I first read about it in the New York Times, in an article that said it was going to be demolished.
id="t-52000"&&And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer, but I realized no one was doing anything.
id="t-60000"&&I went to my first community board meeting -- which I'd never been to one before -- and sat next to another guy named Joshua David, who's a travel writer.
id="t-69000"&&And at the end of the meeting, we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project; most people wanted to tear it down.
id="t-75000"&&So we exchanged business cards, and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization, Friends of the High Line.
id="t-83000"&&And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition, but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it. 

id="t-90000"&&And what first attracted me, or interested me, was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure, sort of rusty, this industrial relic.
id="t-100000"&&But when I went up on top, it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.
id="t-111000"&&And that's really where we started, the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park, and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape. 

id="t-121000"&&At the time, there was a lot of opposition.
id="t-123000"&&Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
id="t-125000"&&I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement.
id="t-130000"&&Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive, but we still had to make the economic case.
id="t-135000"&&This was after 9/11; the city was in tough times.
id="t-139000"&&So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case.
id="t-143000"&&And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
id="t-145000"&&We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.
id="t-148000"&&So far it's cost about 150 million.
id="t-151000"&&And the main case was, this is going to make good economic sense for the city.
id="t-155000"&&So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million.
id="t-155000"&&So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million.
id="t-155000"&&So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million.
id="t-167000"&&It turns out we were wrong on that.
id="t-169000"&&Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars, or will create about a half a billion dollars, in tax revenues for the city.
id="t-176000"&&We did a design competition, selected a design team.
id="t-180000"&&We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape.
id="t-185000"&&There's three sections. 

id="t-187000"&&We opened the fist section in 2009.
id="t-189000"&&It's been successful beyond our dreams.
id="t-192000"&&Last year we had about two million people, which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.
id="t-197000"&&This is one of my favorite features in section one.
id="t-200000"&&It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave. And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.
id="t-206000"&&The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value; it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.
id="t-212000"&&There's a point, you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari.
id="t-220000"&&And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.
id="t-226000"&&And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.
id="t-228000"&&And they're going to break ground in May. 

id="t-231000"&&And we've already started construction on section two.
id="t-233000"&&This is one of my favorite features, this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line, running through a canopy of trees.
id="t-241000"&&The High Line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've taken a playful take where, instead of framing advertisements, it's going to frame people in views of the city.
id="t-251000"&&This was just installed last month.
id="t-254000"&&And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards, which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan.
id="t-261000"&&And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. 

id="t-268000"&&But what really, I think, makes the High Line special is the people.
id="t-272000"&&And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building, I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it, because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic?
id="t-282000"&&But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that, to me, makes it so special.
id="t-288000"&&Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.
id="t-295000"&&And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands; we just don't do that outside.
id="t-301000"&&But you see that happening on the High Line, and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other. 

id="t-311000"&&Thanks. 

id="t-313000"&&(Applause)
