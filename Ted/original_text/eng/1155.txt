id="t-0"&&My name is Joshua Walters.
id="t-3000"&&I'm a performer. 

id="t-6000"&&(Beatboxing) 

id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-18000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-22000"&&But as far as being a performer, I'm also diagnosed bipolar.
id="t-35000"&&I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage, the more entertaining I become.
id="t-42000"&&When I was 16 in San Francisco, I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.
id="t-50000"&&Maybe you thought that was scary, but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. 

id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-65000"&&I was sent to a place, a psych ward, and in the psych ward, everyone is doing their own one-man show.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time.
id="t-86000"&&They're just practicing.
id="t-88000"&&One day they'll get here.
id="t-92000"&&Now when I got out, I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist.
id="t-100000"&&"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some -- why don't we give you some Zyprexa.
id="t-100000"&&"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some -- why don't we give you some Zyprexa.
id="t-100000"&&"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some -- why don't we give you some Zyprexa.
id="t-110000"&&At least that's what it says on my pen."
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) Some of you are in the field, I can see.
id="t-120000"&&I can feel your noise.
id="t-124000"&&The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode, and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs, where I was sleeping through high school.
id="t-137000"&&The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.
id="t-142000"&&When I got out I had a choice.
id="t-146000"&&I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. 

id="t-157000"&&(Bugle sound) 

id="t-161000"&&There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it.
id="t-169000"&&Now if you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.
id="t-177000"&&Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience, have that creative edge, if you know what I'm talking about.
id="t-184000"&&You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible. 

id="t-188000"&&And there's a book -- John Gartner.
id="t-190000"&&John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge" in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete.
id="t-200000"&&A different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.
id="t-216000"&&Some of them committed suicide.
id="t-218000"&&So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. 

id="t-223000"&&Now recently, there's been development in this field.
id="t-229000"&&And there was an article written in the New York Times, September 2010, that stated: "Just Manic Enough."
id="t-239000"&&Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum -- you know what I'm talking about -- not maybe full bipolar, but they're in the bipolar spectrum -- where on one side, maybe you think you're Jesus, and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) Your call.
id="t-15000"&&(Laughter) Your call.
id="t-273000"&&And everyone's somewhere in the middle.
id="t-275000"&&Everyone's somewhere in the middle. 

id="t-278000"&&So maybe, you know, there's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy.
id="t-290000"&&But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel.
id="t-298000"&&Maybe no one's really crazy.
id="t-302000"&&Everyone is just a little bit mad.
id="t-311000"&&How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum.
id="t-311000"&&How much depends on how lucky you are. 

id="t-324000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-18000"&&(Applause)
