id="t-0"&&You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
id="t-7000"&&And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
id="t-12000"&&You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
id="t-19000"&&I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.
id="t-23000"&&And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
id="t-27000"&&You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. 

id="t-31000"&&That's a painting of a circle.
id="t-33000"&&A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
id="t-36000"&&It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.
id="t-40000"&&My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
id="t-48000"&&I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
id="t-55000"&&She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.
id="t-60000"&&She did it in secret.
id="t-62000"&&She did it for three years.
id="t-64000"&&And I had to get out of town.
id="t-67000"&&I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- met a lover -- and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations. 

id="t-83000"&&About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.
id="t-92000"&&I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults.
id="t-97000"&&Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
id="t-105000"&&And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this."

id="t-115000"&&Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
id="t-117000"&&We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
id="t-124000"&&We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary.
id="t-132000"&&It's something we knew how to do.
id="t-134000"&&And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
id="t-145000"&&And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. 

id="t-156000"&&The epiphany is that death is a part of life.
id="t-160000"&&She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.
id="t-167000"&&And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
id="t-171000"&&It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
id="t-176000"&&It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out. 

id="t-186000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-188000"&&(Applause)
