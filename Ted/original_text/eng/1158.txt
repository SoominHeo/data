id="t-0"&&I'm a savant, or more precisely, a high-functioning autistic savant.
id="t-8000"&&It's a rare condition.
id="t-10000"&&And rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language.
id="t-20000"&&Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness.
id="t-28000"&&I can see it in their eyes.
id="t-31000"&&They want to ask me something.
id="t-34000"&&And in the end, quite often, the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out: "If I give you my date of birth, can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text.
id="t-55000"&&I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today.
id="t-64000"&&I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer, to my mind, than work. 

id="t-79000"&&I want to talk to you briefly about perception.
id="t-84000"&&When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name, Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him -- little details that other people seem to miss.
id="t-103000"&&Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life, I'm reminded of why I too became a writer.
id="t-114000"&&In my books, I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding. 

id="t-128000"&&Here are three questions drawn from my work.
id="t-132000"&&Rather than try to figure them out, I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them.
id="t-146000"&&For example, the calculation: can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall?
id="t-154000"&&Or look at the foreign word and the sounds: can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards?
id="t-162000"&&And in terms of the line of poetry, why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit?
id="t-171000"&&I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions, you see, are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge.
id="t-181000"&&Aesthetic judgments, rather than abstract reasoning, guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know.
id="t-193000"&&I'm an extreme example of this. 

id="t-196000"&&My worlds of words and numbers blur with color, emotion and personality.
id="t-203000"&&As Juan said, it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia, an unusual cross-talk between the senses.
id="t-216000"&&Here are the numbers one to 12 as I see them -- every number with its own shape and character.
id="t-224000"&&One is a flash of white light.
id="t-226000"&&Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.
id="t-231000"&&The sketches are in black and white here, but in my mind they have colors.
id="t-236000"&&Three is green.
id="t-238000"&&Four is blue.
id="t-240000"&&Five is yellow. 

id="t-245000"&&I paint as well.
id="t-247000"&&And here is one of my paintings.
id="t-250000"&&It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.
id="t-254000"&&Three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape, the answer to the sum.
id="t-264000"&&What about bigger numbers?
id="t-266000"&&Well you can't get much bigger than Pi, the mathematical constant.
id="t-272000"&&It's an infinite number -- literally goes on forever.
id="t-276000"&&In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi, I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. 

id="t-294000"&&But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.
id="t-297000"&&Words too, for me, have colors and emotions and textures.
id="t-303000"&&And this is an opening phrase from the novel "Lolita."
id="t-307000"&&And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.
id="t-311000"&&And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out.
id="t-321000"&&Another example: a little bit more mathematical.
id="t-325000"&&And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from "The Great Gatsby."
id="t-333000"&&There is a procession of syllables -- wheat, one; prairies, two; lost Swede towns, three -- one, two, three.
id="t-345000"&&And this effect is very pleasant on the mind, and it helps the sentence to feel right. 

id="t-354000"&&Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago.
id="t-359000"&&64 multiplied by 75.
id="t-362000"&&If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number, and that's why chessboards, eight by eight, have 64 squares.
id="t-377000"&&So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive.
id="t-382000"&&What about 75?
id="t-385000"&&Well if 100, if we think of 100 as being like a square, 75 would look like this.
id="t-393000"&&So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind -- something like this.
id="t-402000"&&64 becomes 6,400.
id="t-406000"&&And in the right-hand corner, you don't have to calculate anything.
id="t-412000"&&Four across, four up and down -- it's 16.
id="t-417000"&&So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16.
id="t-424000"&&That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.
id="t-429000"&&It's 16, 16, 16, 48, 4,800 -- 4,800, the answer to the sum.
id="t-438000"&&Easy when you know how. 

id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-443000"&&The second question was an Icelandic word.
id="t-446000"&&I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic.
id="t-451000"&&So let me narrow the choices down to two.
id="t-456000"&&Hnugginn: is it a happy word, or a sad word?
id="t-462000"&&What do you say?
id="t-465000"&&Okay.
id="t-467000"&&Some people say it's happy.
id="t-469000"&&Most people, a majority of people, say sad.
id="t-473000"&&And it actually means sad.
id="t-45000"&&(Laughter) Why do, statistically, a majority of people say that a word is sad, in this case, heavy in other cases?
id="t-490000"&&In my theory, language evolves in such a way that sounds match, correspond with, the subjective, with the personal, intuitive experience of the listener. 

id="t-505000"&&Let's have a look at the third question.
id="t-509000"&&It's a line from a poem by John Keats.
id="t-512000"&&Words, like numbers, express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world.
id="t-524000"&&It stands to reason that we, existing in this world, should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships.
id="t-532000"&&And poets, like other artists, play with those intuitive understandings.
id="t-538000"&&In the case of hare, it's an ambiguous sound in English.
id="t-543000"&&It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.
id="t-546000"&&And if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability.
id="t-554000"&&They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion.
id="t-560000"&&So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension.
id="t-566000"&&The hare itself, the animal -- not a cat, not a dog, a hare -- why a hare?
id="t-573000"&&Because think of the picture -- not the word, the picture.
id="t-577000"&&The overlong ears, the overlarge feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble. 

id="t-590000"&&So in these few minutes, I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions, numbers, shapes and personalities.
id="t-606000"&&The world is richer, vaster than it too often seems to be.
id="t-613000"&&I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes. 

id="t-619000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-621000"&&(Applause)
