id="t-432000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-434000"&&Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites.
id="t-443000"&&As a child studying these eternal masterpieces, Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
id="t-459000"&&Late at night, after hours of practicing, I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
id="t-469000"&&It all became music to me.
id="t-472000"&&I didn't hear the boundaries. 

id="t-475000"&&I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
id="t-479000"&&His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me.
id="t-483000"&&But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression, I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument. 

id="t-501000"&&The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience.
id="t-510000"&&The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
id="t-519000"&&The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source.
id="t-537000"&&My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas. 

id="t-542000"&&When composers write music for me, I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
id="t-547000"&&I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
id="t-553000"&&I want to create endless possibilities with this cello.
id="t-557000"&&I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I.
