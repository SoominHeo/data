id="t-0"&&I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
id="t-3000"&&But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
id="t-13000"&&I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion.
id="t-24000"&&But I don't buy anything new.
id="t-26000"&&I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.
id="t-31000"&&Aww, thank you.
id="t-34000"&&Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet.
id="t-42000"&&I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
id="t-52000"&&I mean, what am I going to find today?
id="t-54000"&&Is it going to be my size?
id="t-56000"&&Will I like the color?
id="t-58000"&&Will it be under $20?
id="t-61000"&&If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won. 

id="t-65000"&&I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
id="t-72000"&&I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
id="t-76000"&&So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
id="t-79000"&&I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it.
id="t-85000"&&Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase.
id="t-90000"&&I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
id="t-98000"&&And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- (Laughter) that means I found a few things.
id="t-106000"&&And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
id="t-109000"&&Does that sound good?
id="t-111000"&&(Applause) So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. 

id="t-123000"&&So let's start with Sunday.
id="t-125000"&&I call this "Shiny Tiger."
id="t-127000"&&You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
id="t-131000"&&You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
id="t-134000"&&This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. 

id="t-142000"&&Monday: Color is powerful.
id="t-145000"&&It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
id="t-102000"&&(Laughter) If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you. 

id="t-159000"&&Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated.
id="t-164000"&&I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
id="t-170000"&&Just be who you are.
id="t-172000"&&If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it. 

id="t-179000"&&Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
id="t-183000"&&Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
id="t-191000"&&I like to smile and say, "Thank you."

id="t-195000"&&Thursday: Confidence is key.
id="t-199000"&&If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.
id="t-203000"&&And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
id="t-207000"&&I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
id="t-211000"&&But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant.
id="t-215000"&&And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
id="t-218000"&&If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.
id="t-227000"&&So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
id="t-229000"&&We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
id="t-232000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-111000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-237000"&&Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything. 

id="t-245000"&&And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
id="t-255000"&&It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations. 

id="t-263000"&&So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase.
id="t-267000"&&So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back.
id="t-271000"&&Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.
id="t-277000"&&I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look. 

id="t-291000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-111000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-232000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-111000"&&(Applause)
