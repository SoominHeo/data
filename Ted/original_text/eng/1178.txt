id="t-0"&&The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile.
id="t-13000"&&Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
id="t-16000"&&On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
id="t-21000"&&Every Iranian artist, in one form or another, is political.
id="t-26000"&&Politics have defined our lives.
id="t-29000"&&If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution.
id="t-39000"&&If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family.
id="t-49000"&&Therefore, we don't find the moral, emotional, psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility. 

id="t-61000"&&Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country.
id="t-77000"&&Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
id="t-83000"&&We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion.
id="t-97000"&&We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
id="t-101000"&&And at the same time, we're fighting another battle.
id="t-105000"&&That is our regime, our government -- our atrocious government, [that] has done every crime in order to stay in power.
id="t-116000"&&Our artists are at risk.
id="t-119000"&&We are in a position of danger.
id="t-122000"&&We pose a threat to the order of the government. 

id="t-126000"&&But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran.
id="t-139000"&&We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people.
id="t-146000"&&We are the reporters of our people, and are communicators to the outside world.
id="t-153000"&&Art is our weapon.
id="t-156000"&&Culture is a form of resistance.
id="t-159000"&&I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression.
id="t-164000"&&For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics.
id="t-169000"&&From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture.
id="t-174000"&&But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment.
id="t-188000"&&Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication. 

id="t-195000"&&My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.
id="t-200000"&&I did not start to make social commentary about my country.
id="t-206000"&&The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years.
id="t-214000"&&It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
id="t-219000"&&While I was absent from Iran, the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture.
id="t-230000"&&I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society.
id="t-237000"&&But instead, I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore.
id="t-244000"&&More so, I became very interested, as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions, I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how, indeed, it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women.
id="t-260000"&&I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting, in the way the women of Iran, historically, seemed to embody the political transformation.
id="t-270000"&&So in a way, by studying a woman, you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. 

id="t-277000"&&So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life, and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom, the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God, faith, but violence and crime and cruelty.
id="t-299000"&&For me, this became incredibly important.
id="t-302000"&&And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
id="t-305000"&&I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place, but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
id="t-318000"&&This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover.
id="t-326000"&&So my art became slightly more critical.
id="t-329000"&&My knife became a little sharper.
id="t-331000"&&And I fell into a life in exile.
id="t-335000"&&I am a nomadic artist.
id="t-337000"&&I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
id="t-340000"&&I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. 

id="t-343000"&&Now I am making films.
id="t-345000"&&Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men."
id="t-349000"&&"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history.
id="t-354000"&&It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader, Dr. Mossadegh.
id="t-363000"&&The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
id="t-367000"&&It's a magical realist novel.
id="t-369000"&&This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
id="t-373000"&&My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions. 

id="t-401000"&&I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country.
id="t-410000"&&That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution.
id="t-414000"&&That Iran was once a secular society, and we had democracy, and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government, by the British government.
id="t-425000"&&This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized -- in the way we looked, in the way we played music, in the way we had intellectual life.
id="t-441000"&&And most of all, in the way that we fought for democracy.
id="t-446000"&&These are some of the shots actually from my film.
id="t-449000"&&These are some of the images of the coup.
id="t-451000"&&And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots. 

id="t-456000"&&This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story, but also a feminine story.
id="t-463000"&&Being a visual artist, indeed, I am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics, religion, the question of feminism, and become an important, timeless, universal work of art.
id="t-479000"&&The challenge I have is how to do that.
id="t-483000"&&How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
id="t-486000"&&How to move you with your emotions, but also make your mind work.
id="t-490000"&&These are some of the images and the characters of the film.
id="t-505000"&&Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. 

id="t-514000"&&What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran.
id="t-528000"&&The green movement significantly inspired the world.
id="t-532000"&&It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy.
id="t-539000"&&What was most significant for me was, once again, the presence of the women.
id="t-545000"&&They're absolutely inspirational for me.
id="t-547000"&&If in the Islamic Revolution, the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice, now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran -- women who were educated, forward thinking, non-traditional, sexually open, fearless and seriously feminist.
id="t-570000"&&These women and those young men united Iranians across the world, inside and outside. 

id="t-578000"&&I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women.
id="t-584000"&&That, under all circumstances, they have pushed the boundary.
id="t-588000"&&They have confronted the authority.
id="t-590000"&&They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way.
id="t-594000"&&And once again, they proved themselves.
id="t-596000"&&I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice.
id="t-604000"&&And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West only for now. 

id="t-613000"&&Thank you so much. 

id="t-615000"&&(Applause)
