id="t-0"&&My name is Amit.
id="t-2000"&&And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.
id="t-14000"&&And it took 18 months.
id="t-16000"&&A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
id="t-21000"&&But I'm going to focus on the demo.
id="t-24000"&&There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 

id="t-27000"&&I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access.
id="t-32000"&&And I grew up in India.
id="t-34000"&&I had a great education -- I'm not complaining -- but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
id="t-40000"&&And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.
id="t-45000"&&And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.
id="t-52000"&&So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this. 

id="t-57000"&&I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch.
id="t-63000"&&So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
id="t-67000"&&You look around at all these museums here.
id="t-69000"&&You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
id="t-73000"&&I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
id="t-79000"&&Two ways of going in -- very simple.
id="t-82000"&&Click and, bang, you're in this museum.
id="t-84000"&&It doesn't matter where you are -- Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
id="t-88000"&&You move around, you have fun.
id="t-90000"&&You want to navigate around the museum?
id="t-92000"&&Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump.
id="t-96000"&&You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
id="t-96000"&&You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
id="t-96000"&&You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
id="t-100000"&&Explore. 

id="t-102000"&&(Applause) 

Thanks.
Thanks.

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-112000"&&So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
id="t-117000"&&I see this plus sign.
id="t-119000"&&If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
id="t-121000"&&Now this is one of the images.
id="t-123000"&&So this is all of the meta-data information.
id="t-125000"&&For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.
id="t-130000"&&And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology.
id="t-134000"&&So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
id="t-138000"&&And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
id="t-142000"&&So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
id="t-145000"&&You can zoom around very simply.
id="t-147000"&&You see some fun stuff happening here.
id="t-149000"&&I love this guy; his expression is priceless. 

id="t-152000"&&But then you really want to go deep.
id="t-154000"&&And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
id="t-154000"&&And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
id="t-154000"&&And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
id="t-162000"&&Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something.
id="t-167000"&&I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday.
id="t-178000"&&And apparently it was quite popular.
id="t-180000"&&I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
id="t-184000"&&Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
id="t-187000"&&Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
id="t-192000"&&Here is where we were, and this is the painting. 

id="t-102000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-205000"&&The best is yet to come -- so in a second.
id="t-208000"&&So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
id="t-213000"&&So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."
id="t-215000"&&Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.
id="t-218000"&&But what if you want to see brush strokes?
id="t-220000"&&And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
id="t-220000"&&And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
id="t-220000"&&And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
id="t-226000"&&I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
id="t-232000"&&This is "The Starry Night," I think, never seen like this before. 

id="t-237000"&&I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
id="t-239000"&&There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
id="t-239000"&&There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
id="t-239000"&&There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
id="t-244000"&&Any one of you, anybody -- doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.
id="t-251000"&&You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images.
id="t-256000"&&Very simply, you go in -- and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around.
id="t-262000"&&This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
id="t-264000"&&You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. 

id="t-273000"&&So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
id="t-280000"&&It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
id="t-282000"&&I probably shouldn't say that.
id="t-284000"&&It really comes from these artists.
id="t-286000"&&And that's been my humbling experience in this.
id="t-289000"&&I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.
id="t-296000"&&And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"
id="t-302000"&&And the answer is no.
id="t-304000"&&It's to supplement the experience. 

And that's it.
id="t-310000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-102000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-310000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-102000"&&(Applause)
