id="t-0"&&It's great being here at TED.
id="t-3000"&&You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet.
id="t-12000"&&The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted.
id="t-19000"&&And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years. 

id="t-32000"&&I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years.
id="t-39000"&&To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.
id="t-43000"&&It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.
id="t-47000"&&Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with.
id="t-55000"&&Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth.
id="t-60000"&&It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it. 

id="t-65000"&&When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action.
id="t-71000"&&We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.
id="t-77000"&&And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind.
id="t-82000"&&It's like the canary in the coalmine.
id="t-84000"&&If they disappear, so do we.
id="t-87000"&&It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. 

id="t-93000"&&What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: "What motivates the pollinators?"
id="t-102000"&&Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward."
id="t-107000"&&Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"
id="t-110000"&&And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."
id="t-112000"&&I go, "Why?"
id="t-114000"&&"Well, in order to reproduce."
id="t-116000"&&"Well, why?"
id="t-118000"&&And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."
id="t-122000"&&And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.
id="t-129000"&&Everything in the universe wears out."

id="t-131000"&&And that blew my mind.
id="t-133000"&&Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life.
id="t-148000"&&Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment.
id="t-156000"&&It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again. 

id="t-163000"&&So here is some nectar from my film.
id="t-166000"&&I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden.
id="t-172000"&&And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder.
id="t-180000"&&Here are some images from the film. 

id="t-183000"&&(Music) 

id="t-427000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-435000"&&Thank you.
id="t-437000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-427000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-435000"&&Thank you.
