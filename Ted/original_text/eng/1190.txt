id="t-0"&&So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this.
id="t-12000"&&But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.
id="t-23000"&&I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process.
id="t-35000"&&Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface. 

id="t-44000"&&So we start by brewing the tea.
id="t-46000"&&I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.
id="t-52000"&&We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath.
id="t-57000"&&We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C. And then we're ready to add the living organism.
id="t-64000"&&And along with that, some acetic acid.
id="t-66000"&&And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.
id="t-73000"&&We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
id="t-76000"&&And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it.
id="t-81000"&&And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.
id="t-84000"&&So this is my mini fabric farm. 

id="t-86000"&&After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
id="t-91000"&&So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.
id="t-94000"&&And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
id="t-98000"&&So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose.
id="t-102000"&&And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.
id="t-106000"&&After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.
id="t-111000"&&So the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10.
id="t-116000"&&And this is a static culture.
id="t-118000"&&You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow.
id="t-122000"&&It doesn't need light. 

id="t-124000"&&And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold, soapy water.
id="t-129000"&&At this point, it's really heavy.
id="t-131000"&&It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate.
id="t-135000"&&So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
id="t-137000"&&Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.
id="t-141000"&&And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
id="t-153000"&&And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
id="t-162000"&&And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams. 

id="t-166000"&&So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.
id="t-169000"&&I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me.
id="t-174000"&&Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
id="t-179000"&&I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation.
id="t-184000"&&Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning.
id="t-188000"&&And using indigo, make it anti-microbial.
id="t-192000"&&And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.
id="t-199000"&&And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that. 

id="t-205000"&&What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
id="t-208000"&&So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water.
id="t-218000"&&The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked.
id="t-224000"&&Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
id="t-230000"&&What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need.
id="t-236000"&&So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.
id="t-241000"&&Align it in this direction.
id="t-243000"&&Make it hydrophobic.
id="t-245000"&&And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape."

id="t-250000"&&Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue.
id="t-261000"&&But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire.
id="t-275000"&&Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products. 

id="t-286000"&&What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency.
id="t-291000"&&So we only grow what we need.
id="t-293000"&&There's no waste.
id="t-295000"&&And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant.
id="t-304000"&&Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.
id="t-310000"&&What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials.
id="t-318000"&&But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. 

id="t-325000"&&Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact.
id="t-329000"&&We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house.
id="t-337000"&&So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow?
id="t-342000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-344000"&&(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.
id="t-344000"&&(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.
id="t-358000"&&This is one of the jackets you grew? 

id="t-360000"&&SL: Yes, it is.
id="t-362000"&&It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
id="t-368000"&&(Laughter) It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it. 

id="t-373000"&&BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
id="t-373000"&&BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
id="t-373000"&&BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
