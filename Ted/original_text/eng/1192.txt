id="t-0"&&Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
id="t-9000"&&And it is.
id="t-11000"&&And yet, it feels natural to us now. 

id="t-14000"&&I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
id="t-24000"&&We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.
id="t-33000"&&At the time, we knew that it was political.
id="t-38000"&&We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
id="t-46000"&&And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.
id="t-61000"&&And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly.
id="t-82000"&&Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. 

id="t-91000"&&When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman.
id="t-100000"&&Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
id="t-103000"&&I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength.
id="t-107000"&&I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other.
id="t-111000"&&Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.
id="t-118000"&&But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy.
id="t-124000"&&But her suffering is equal to mine. 

id="t-127000"&&So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. 

id="t-138000"&&(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
id="t-144000"&&I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
id="t-153000"&&And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
id="t-168000"&&So they introduced me to five families.
id="t-177000"&&And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
id="t-182000"&&She was the only mother in the group.
id="t-187000"&&The others were brothers, sisters.
id="t-193000"&&And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me.
id="t-199000"&&I suffered a lot as a mother.
id="t-206000"&&I was married when I was 14.
id="t-211000"&&I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16.
id="t-222000"&&So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
id="t-228000"&&And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive.
id="t-239000"&&I know she really cried for her son.
id="t-244000"&&But she knows where he is.
id="t-253000"&&My son, I don't know where he is.
id="t-253000"&&My son, I don't know where he is.
id="t-253000"&&My son, I don't know where he is.
id="t-257000"&&I don't know what happened to him. 

id="t-263000"&&So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
id="t-273000"&&For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change.
id="t-284000"&&It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children.
id="t-298000"&&We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
id="t-304000"&&It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children.
id="t-319000"&&I talk against violence, against terrorism.
id="t-322000"&&I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
id="t-343000"&&So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good.
id="t-355000"&&This is why I'm here in front of you. 

id="t-357000"&&PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.
id="t-383000"&&But we were all so nervous.
id="t-386000"&&"Why does she want to meet us?"
id="t-389000"&&And then she was nervous.
id="t-391000"&&"Why did we want to meet her?"
id="t-393000"&&What did we want from each other?
id="t-397000"&&Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept.
id="t-402000"&&Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
id="t-411000"&&And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
id="t-428000"&&I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."
id="t-440000"&&But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
id="t-448000"&&And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.
id="t-454000"&&By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. 

id="t-462000"&&Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.
id="t-475000"&&I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
id="t-484000"&&And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much.
id="t-492000"&&And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
id="t-503000"&&Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"

id="t-509000"&&So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?
id="t-515000"&&Because our time is up. 

id="t-517000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-525000"&&(Translator) AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.
id="t-533000"&&You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous.
id="t-540000"&&You must be tolerant.
id="t-545000"&&You have to fight against violence.
id="t-551000"&&And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
id="t-557000"&&This is what I wanted to say. 

id="t-559000"&&(Applause)
