id="t-0"&&My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.
id="t-3000"&&I've been making toys for the last 30 years.
id="t-6000"&&The early '70s, I was in college.
id="t-8000"&&It was a very revolutionary time.
id="t-10000"&&It was a political ferment, so to say -- students out in the streets of Paris, revolting against authority.
id="t-17000"&&America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.
id="t-22000"&&In India, we had the Naxalite movement, the [unclear] movement.
id="t-27000"&&But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy.
id="t-32000"&&The National Movement of India was testimony to that.
id="t-36000"&&Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement.
id="t-42000"&&Now in the early '70s, one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools. 

id="t-50000"&&There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.
id="t-58000"&&At 31, he was not able to relate the kind of [unclear] research, which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.
id="t-65000"&&So he designed and went and started a village science program.
id="t-68000"&&Many people were inspired by this.
id="t-70000"&&The slogan of the early '70s was "Go to the people.
id="t-74000"&&Live with them; love them.
id="t-74000"&&Live with them; love them.
id="t-74000"&&Live with them; love them.
id="t-79000"&&This was kind of the defining slogan. 

id="t-81000"&&Well I took one year.
id="t-83000"&&I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.
id="t-86000"&&I worked there for two years, and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.
id="t-91000"&&Often one doesn't know what one wants to do, but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.
id="t-95000"&&So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.
id="t-98000"&&And it was a turning point.
id="t-100000"&&It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.
id="t-107000"&&So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."
id="t-109000"&&So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside.
id="t-113000"&&And one thing which I found was this black rubber. 

id="t-117000"&&This is called a cycle valve tube.
id="t-119000"&&When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.
id="t-122000"&&And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
id="t-122000"&&And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
id="t-122000"&&And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
id="t-134000"&&It's like its own little coupling.
id="t-136000"&&If you have three of them, and you loop them together, well you make a triangle.
id="t-140000"&&With four, you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kind of polygons.
id="t-146000"&&And they have some wonderful properties.
id="t-148000"&&If you look at the hexagon, for instance, it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
id="t-153000"&&You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.
id="t-155000"&&You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
id="t-157000"&&But this is very shaky.
id="t-159000"&&Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
id="t-163000"&&Push it and it becomes house shaped.
id="t-165000"&&This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again, very shaky.
id="t-169000"&&This square might look very square and prim.
id="t-171000"&&Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
id="t-173000"&&It becomes kite-shaped.
id="t-175000"&&But give a child a triangle, he can't do a thing to it. 

id="t-179000"&&Why use triangles?
id="t-181000"&&Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
id="t-183000"&&We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
id="t-188000"&&Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this.
id="t-196000"&&Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.
id="t-199000"&&They always make a triangular roof.
id="t-201000"&&Now this is people science. 

id="t-203000"&&And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick, you'll get a T joint.
id="t-209000"&&And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle, I would make a tetrahedron.
id="t-215000"&&So you make all these 3D shapes.
id="t-217000"&&You make a tetrahedron like this.
id="t-220000"&&And once you make these, you make a little house.
id="t-228000"&&Put this on top.
id="t-228000"&&Put this on top.
id="t-228000"&&Put this on top.
id="t-232000"&&You just need a ton.
id="t-235000"&&Now this was -- you make a joint of six, you make an icosahedron.
id="t-239000"&&You can play around with it.
id="t-241000"&&This makes an igloo.
id="t-243000"&&Now this is in 1978.
id="t-245000"&&I was a 24-year-old young engineer.
id="t-248000"&&And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.
id="t-252000"&&(Applause) If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside, you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.
id="t-263000"&&Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron, which means the little carbon atom. 

id="t-267000"&&Well since then, I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country -- village schools, government schools, municipal schools, Ivy League schools -- I've been invited by most of them.
id="t-282000"&&And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
id="t-282000"&&And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
id="t-282000"&&And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
id="t-282000"&&And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
id="t-282000"&&And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.

id="t-292000"&&Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
id="t-295000"&&Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon.
id="t-295000"&&Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon.
id="t-295000"&&Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon.
id="t-302000"&&And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.
id="t-307000"&&So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear] This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.
id="t-316000"&&And this is how you make a valve.
id="t-318000"&&You put a little sticky tape.
id="t-322000"&&This is one-way traffic.
id="t-326000"&&Well we make lots and lots of pumps.
id="t-328000"&&And this is the other one -- that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts.
id="t-334000"&&Now this is what you do, is you bend both these legs into a triangle, and you just wrap some tape around.
id="t-340000"&&And this is the pump.
id="t-342000"&&And now, if you have this pump, it's like a great, great sprinkler.
id="t-348000"&&It's like a centrifuge.
id="t-350000"&&If you spin something, it tends to fly out. 

id="t-252000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-355000"&&Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh, you would make this with the palmyra leaf.
id="t-359000"&&Many of our folk toys have great science principles.
id="t-363000"&&If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
id="t-363000"&&If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
id="t-363000"&&If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
id="t-370000"&&Right.
id="t-370000"&&Right.
id="t-370000"&&Right.
id="t-377000"&&There are four pictures.
id="t-379000"&&You see insects, you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies, frogs, snakes, eagles.
id="t-385000"&&Here's a paper which you could [unclear] -- designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928, Arthur Stone, documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.
id="t-394000"&&But this is great fun for children.
id="t-396000"&&They all study about the food chain.
id="t-398000"&&The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes; the snakes are eaten by the eagles.
id="t-402000"&&And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper -- A4 size paper -- you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school -- a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.
id="t-412000"&&In three minutes, you just fold this up.
id="t-415000"&&And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.
id="t-418000"&&If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.
id="t-421000"&&With a bigger one, you make a bigger one. 

id="t-426000"&&Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.
id="t-428000"&&And you put a little fan here.
id="t-430000"&&And this is a hundred-year-old toy.
id="t-432000"&&There have been six major research papers on this.
id="t-435000"&&There's some grooves over here, you can see.
id="t-437000"&&And if I take a reed -- if I rub this, something very amazing happens.
id="t-441000"&&Six major research papers on this.
id="t-443000"&&As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.
id="t-445000"&&He wrote a paper on this.
id="t-447000"&&And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.
id="t-447000"&&And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.
id="t-455000"&&If you want to put a colored disk, well all these seven colors coalesce.
id="t-460000"&&And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back, that white light's made of seven colors, just by spinning this around. 

id="t-467000"&&This is a straw.
id="t-470000"&&What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner, so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.
id="t-478000"&&This is a kind of a blowing straw.
id="t-480000"&&I just put this inside this.
id="t-482000"&&There's a hole here, and I shut this.
id="t-490000"&&And this costs very little money to make -- great fun for children to do. 

id="t-494000"&&What we do is make a very simple electric motor.
id="t-498000"&&Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.
id="t-502000"&&The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.
id="t-505000"&&If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.
id="t-508000"&&This is an old bicycle tube, which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.
id="t-512000"&&This is a permanent magnet.
id="t-514000"&&Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.
id="t-517000"&&It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin.
id="t-521000"&&We made 30,000. 

id="t-523000"&&Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years, they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.
id="t-529000"&&When teachers make it, children make it.
id="t-531000"&&You can see a gleam in their eye.
id="t-533000"&&They get a thrill of what science is all about.
id="t-538000"&&And this science is not a rich man's game.
id="t-540000"&&In a democratic country, science must reach to our most oppressed, to the most marginalized children.
id="t-547000"&&This program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools.
id="t-553000"&&Over 100,000 children learn science this way.
id="t-557000"&&And we're just trying to see possibilities. 

id="t-559000"&&Look, this is the tetrapak -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment.
id="t-564000"&&There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum -- which are are sealed together.
id="t-569000"&&They are fused together, so you can't separate them.
id="t-571000"&&Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron.
id="t-577000"&&So something which is trash, which is choking all the seabirds, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. 

id="t-588000"&&This is a little straw, and what you do is you just nip two corners here, and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.
id="t-599000"&&You put this in your mouth, and you blow.
id="t-601000"&&(Honk) It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.
id="t-607000"&&You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
id="t-607000"&&You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
id="t-607000"&&You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
id="t-601000"&&(Honk) So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations.
id="t-622000"&&The other is that you keep blowing at it, keep making the sound, and you keep cutting it.
id="t-628000"&&And something very, very nice happens.
id="t-601000"&&(Honk) (Applause) And when you get a very small one -- (Honk) This is what the kids teach you.
id="t-601000"&&(Honk) (Applause) And when you get a very small one -- (Honk) This is what the kids teach you.

id="t-653000"&&Well before I go any further, this is something worth sharing.
id="t-657000"&&This is a touching slate meant for blind children.
id="t-659000"&&This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate, and this is my drawing pen, which is basically a film box.
id="t-666000"&&It's basically like a fisherman's line, a fishing line.
id="t-672000"&&And this is wool over here.
id="t-674000"&&If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.
id="t-677000"&&And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.
id="t-681000"&&Wool sticks on Velcro.
id="t-685000"&&There are 12 million blind children in our country -- (Applause) who live in a world of darkness.
id="t-692000"&&And this has come as a great boon to them.
id="t-695000"&&There's a factory out there making our children blind, not able to provide them with food, not able to provide them with vitamin A.
id="t-702000"&&But this has come as a great boon for them.
id="t-702000"&&But this has come as a great boon for them.
id="t-702000"&&But this has come as a great boon for them.

id="t-708000"&&This is very, very simple.
id="t-708000"&&This is very, very simple.
id="t-708000"&&This is very, very simple.
id="t-713000"&&These are two magnets.
id="t-715000"&&This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.
id="t-718000"&&Small pulley and two strong magnets.
id="t-720000"&&And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
id="t-723000"&&If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.
id="t-725000"&&There will be a spinning magnetic field.
id="t-727000"&&Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.
id="t-730000"&&And you can see, this LED is going to glow.
id="t-732000"&&So this is a small crank generator. 

id="t-736000"&&Well, this is, again, it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.
id="t-742000"&&And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well they just keep going on.
id="t-753000"&&And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.
id="t-759000"&&And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. 

id="t-764000"&&Well in the end, what we can also do: we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps.
id="t-771000"&&This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
id="t-771000"&&This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
id="t-771000"&&This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
id="t-781000"&&We make lots of toys with newspapers, and this is one of them.
id="t-785000"&&And this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird.
id="t-790000"&&All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.
id="t-793000"&&And if you have one of these birds -- children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.
id="t-800000"&&And you can see, this is a little fantail bird. 

id="t-806000"&&Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.
id="t-809000"&&This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."
id="t-811000"&&The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
id="t-813000"&&It goes very slowly.
id="t-815000"&&And there were lots of passengers on the ship, and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.
id="t-819000"&&"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance, and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."
id="t-823000"&&And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia.
id="t-827000"&&The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap.
id="t-831000"&&That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord.
id="t-843000"&&And the second night, he would take the same cap and give it another fold.
id="t-847000"&&And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap.
id="t-852000"&&And the third night, he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very, very famous cap.
id="t-857000"&&If you've seen any of our Bollywood films, this is what the policeman wears, it's called a zapalu cap.
id="t-863000"&&It's been catapulted to international glory. 

id="t-866000"&&And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
id="t-869000"&&So that's a ship.
id="t-871000"&&And now the end: everyone was enjoying the journey very much.
id="t-875000"&&They were singing and dancing.
id="t-877000"&&Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
id="t-880000"&&And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.
id="t-883000"&&A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down.
id="t-887000"&&And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.
id="t-890000"&&And there's a third one over here.
id="t-892000"&&This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
id="t-894000"&&And the ship sinks, and the captain has lost everything, but for a life jacket. 

id="t-901000"&&Thank you so much. 

id="t-252000"&&(Applause)
