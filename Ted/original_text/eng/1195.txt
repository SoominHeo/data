id="t-0"&&So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
id="t-10000"&&It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.
id="t-14000"&&It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. 

The book starts like this.
The book starts like this.
id="t-24000"&&As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
id="t-36000"&&Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
id="t-40000"&&And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
id="t-44000"&&And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
id="t-52000"&&And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
id="t-60000"&&And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. 

id="t-63000"&&(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. 

id="t-71000"&&Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
id="t-76000"&&This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
id="t-80000"&&Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
id="t-85000"&&And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.
id="t-91000"&&So you can open this one. 

id="t-94000"&&(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... 

id="t-97000"&&MM: It starts playing immediately.
id="t-99000"&&And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
id="t-104000"&&Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.
id="t-112000"&&But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.
id="t-116000"&&This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.
id="t-120000"&&But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.
id="t-130000"&&We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. 

id="t-143000"&&This is one of my favorites.
id="t-145000"&&So this shows ... (Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.
id="t-163000"&&And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
id="t-173000"&&And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
id="t-176000"&&It also runs on the iPhone.
id="t-179000"&&And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
id="t-183000"&&And it works the exact same way.
id="t-185000"&&You can pinch into any page.
id="t-187000"&&Open it up. 

id="t-203000"&&So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice."
id="t-207000"&&Thank you.
id="t-154000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-217000"&&Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.
id="t-220000"&&Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
id="t-224000"&&What is the business here?
id="t-226000"&&Is this something that other people can do? 

id="t-228000"&&MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
id="t-233000"&&So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. 

id="t-243000"&&CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
id="t-243000"&&CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
id="t-243000"&&CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
id="t-243000"&&CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?

MM: Thank you.
MM: Thank you.
