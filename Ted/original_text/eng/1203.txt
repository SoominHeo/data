id="t-0"&&Hi, my name is Marcin -- farmer, technologist.
id="t-5000"&&I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
id="t-8000"&&I started a group called Open Source Ecology.
id="t-11000"&&We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers.
id="t-20000"&&Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost.
id="t-29000"&&We call this the Global Village Construction Set. 

id="t-31000"&&So let me tell you a story.
id="t-33000"&&So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless.
id="t-40000"&&I had no practical skills.
id="t-42000"&&The world presented me with options, and I took them.
id="t-46000"&&I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
id="t-48000"&&So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.
id="t-54000"&&I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
id="t-57000"&&I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again.
id="t-61000"&&Then pretty soon, I was broke too. 

id="t-65000"&&I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet.
id="t-75000"&&I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence.
id="t-87000"&&I found that I would have to build them myself.
id="t-90000"&&So I did just that.
id="t-93000"&&And I tested them.
id="t-96000"&&And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. 

id="t-102000"&&So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.
id="t-112000"&&Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits.
id="t-119000"&&So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.
id="t-122000"&&And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. 

id="t-127000"&&We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.
id="t-132000"&&And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.
id="t-135000"&&We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways.
id="t-143000"&&If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. 

id="t-149000"&&That's not only in the developing world.
id="t-152000"&&Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.
id="t-157000"&&We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid.
id="t-169000"&&Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. 

id="t-181000"&&I've planted a hundred trees in a day.
id="t-184000"&&I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days.
id="t-194000"&&From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. 

id="t-197000"&&If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant.
id="t-203000"&&A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity.
id="t-218000"&&We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. 

id="t-225000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-227000"&&(Applause)
