id="t-0"&&I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.
id="t-4000"&&But you have to have the right tools.
id="t-6000"&&If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.
id="t-11000"&&And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands.
id="t-16000"&&So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh.
id="t-23000"&&And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes.
id="t-27000"&&And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.
id="t-34000"&&We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt.

id="t-43000"&&But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.
id="t-46000"&&You see that really salty Play-Doh?
id="t-48000"&&Well, it conducts electricity.
id="t-50000"&&And this is nothing new.
id="t-52000"&&It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.
id="t-57000"&&But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
id="t-61000"&&And that sugar dough?
id="t-63000"&&Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.
id="t-67000"&&So what does that mean?
id="t-69000"&&Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. 

id="t-78000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-83000"&&And so I want to do a little demo for you.
id="t-87000"&&So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up.
id="t-107000"&&But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit.
id="t-111000"&&If I push these together, the light turns off.
id="t-114000"&&Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.
id="t-116000"&&If I separate them again, I have some light.
id="t-118000"&&Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.
id="t-122000"&&It's like a wall to the electricity.
id="t-124000"&&If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light.
id="t-131000"&&In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
id="t-134000"&&If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning. 

id="t-78000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-145000"&&And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
id="t-145000"&&And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
id="t-145000"&&And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
id="t-152000"&&I plug in again the power to it.
id="t-155000"&&And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.
id="t-158000"&&I can start plugging in lots of lights.
id="t-163000"&&And we can start talking about things like electrical load.
id="t-166000"&&What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor?
id="t-170000"&&It'll dim.
id="t-172000"&&We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.
id="t-180000"&&You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. 

id="t-185000"&&So this is all in your home kitchen.
id="t-188000"&&We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.
id="t-188000"&&We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.

id="t-188000"&&We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.
id="t-196000"&&And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.
id="t-199000"&&We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii. 

id="t-206000"&&So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.
id="t-211000"&&We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should. 

Have fun.
Have fun.
