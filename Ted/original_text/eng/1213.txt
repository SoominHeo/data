id="t-0"&&I wanted to be a rock star.
id="t-2000"&&I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.
id="t-5000"&&To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.
id="t-7000"&&This was in the late '80s.
id="t-9000"&&And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.
id="t-13000"&&They wouldn't have me.
id="t-15000"&&I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.
id="t-18000"&&And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.
id="t-21000"&&And I was certain that's what my life would be. 

id="t-23000"&&And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest.
id="t-35000"&&And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir.
id="t-35000"&&And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir.
id="t-35000"&&And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir.
id="t-44000"&&And I left the room and said, "No way."
id="t-48000"&&The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky, and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.
id="t-54000"&&And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, "Listen, you've got to join choir.
id="t-58000"&&At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico, all expenses paid.
id="t-62000"&&And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."
id="t-66000"&&And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything. 

id="t-71000"&&And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing.
id="t-79000"&&They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart.
id="t-86000"&&In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.
id="t-93000"&&The most transformative experience I've ever had -- in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision.
id="t-104000"&&And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself.
id="t-108000"&&And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out. 

id="t-112000"&&I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life.
id="t-121000"&&I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.
id="t-124000"&&And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.
id="t-128000"&&And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.
id="t-132000"&&And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. 

id="t-140000"&&Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this."
id="t-148000"&&And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called "Sleep."

id="t-155000"&&(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.
id="t-158000"&&My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you.
id="t-164000"&&Here's me singing "Sleep."
id="t-170000"&&I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.
id="t-175000"&&♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ 

id="t-190000"&&Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.
id="t-192000"&&Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure.
id="t-197000"&&And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.
id="t-202000"&&Such an intimate video. 

id="t-204000"&&And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.
id="t-216000"&&So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."
id="t-219000"&&I actually wrote, "OMG," hopefully for the last time in public ever.
id="t-224000"&&(Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers.
id="t-228000"&&And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."
id="t-236000"&&And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 

id="t-239000"&&Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting.
id="t-245000"&&And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be.
id="t-253000"&&Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to.
id="t-258000"&&And then as the videos started to come in ... 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) from Massachusetts. 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden. 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas. 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) 

id="t-305000"&&There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions.
id="t-309000"&&And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.
id="t-311000"&&I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.
id="t-321000"&&Here's our winner of the soprano solo.
id="t-323000"&&This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.
id="t-263000"&&(Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like, "No problem, everything's fine."

id="t-224000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-350000"&&And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines.
id="t-354000"&&And he said, "Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life.
id="t-358000"&&I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."
id="t-358000"&&I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."
id="t-358000"&&I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."
id="t-363000"&&And Scott aggregated all of the videos.
id="t-365000"&&He scrubbed the audio.
id="t-367000"&&He made sure that everything lined up.
id="t-369000"&&And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.
id="t-372000"&&This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir. 

id="t-263000"&&(Singing) 

id="t-454000"&&I'll stop it there in the interest of time.
id="t-457000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-457000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-478000"&&Thank you so much. 

id="t-480000"&&And I had the same reaction you did.
id="t-482000"&&I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.
id="t-484000"&&I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.
id="t-494000"&&And the video went viral.
id="t-496000"&&We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it.
id="t-500000"&&And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, "All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"
id="t-504000"&&And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.
id="t-515000"&&And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions.
id="t-520000"&&This time we got some more mature members.
id="t-263000"&&(Singing) And some younger members. 

id="t-536000"&&(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England.
id="t-536000"&&(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England.
id="t-548000"&&Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 

id="t-551000"&&Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts.
id="t-555000"&&This is Beau Awtin.
id="t-557000"&&(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ 

id="t-564000"&&EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.
id="t-572000"&&And there were 900 people involved in that.
id="t-574000"&&So I told the singers, "That's our goal.
id="t-576000"&&That's the number for us to beat."
id="t-578000"&&And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-457000"&&(Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. 

id="t-600000"&&And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it.
id="t-610000"&&And I've just chosen a few of them here.
id="t-612000"&&"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.
id="t-614000"&&Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.
id="t-617000"&&It's so wonderful to sing together again!"
id="t-620000"&&I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.
id="t-622000"&&"Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway."
id="t-629000"&&And my personal favorite, "When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it."
id="t-635000"&&Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.
id="t-637000"&&Me too.
id="t-639000"&&"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.
id="t-644000"&&It is a dream come true to be part of this choir, as I've never been part of one.
id="t-649000"&&When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map, I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.
id="t-654000"&&As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world."

id="t-659000"&&So two things struck me deeply about this.
id="t-662000"&&The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other.
id="t-669000"&&It doesn't matter the technology.
id="t-671000"&&And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.
id="t-676000"&&It wasn't a virtual choir.
id="t-679000"&&There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.
id="t-682000"&&But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.
id="t-687000"&&I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family. 

id="t-692000"&&What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.
id="t-698000"&&This will be a premiere today.
id="t-700000"&&We're not finished with the video yet.
id="t-702000"&&You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious.
id="t-708000"&&But we do have the first three minutes.
id="t-710000"&&And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.
id="t-715000"&&You're the very first people to see this.
id="t-717000"&&This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 

id="t-722000"&&(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫ ♫ beneath the moon ♫ ♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫ ♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫ ♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫ ♫ Upon my pillow, ♫ ♫ safe in bed, ♫ ♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫ ♫ I cannot sleep ♫ ♫ my mind's aflight ♫ ♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫ ♫ If there are noises in the night ♫ 

Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-457000"&&(Applause) Thank you very much.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-457000"&&(Applause)
