id="t-0"&&As a boy, I loved cars.
id="t-4000"&&When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.
id="t-10000"&&Like this.
id="t-12000"&&And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.
id="t-19000"&&Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 

id="t-25000"&&I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
id="t-34000"&&And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.
id="t-40000"&&So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
id="t-43000"&&We built the hardware and the software.
id="t-46000"&&We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.
id="t-51000"&&And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
id="t-62000"&&Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 

id="t-65000"&&Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California.
id="t-75000"&&We've driven 140,000 miles.
id="t-78000"&&Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.
id="t-91000"&&It's the perfect driving mechanism.
id="t-94000"&&We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.
id="t-98000"&&We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. 

id="t-102000"&&We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself.
id="t-111000"&&In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.
id="t-117000"&&Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.
id="t-127000"&&(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. 

id="t-137000"&&(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
id="t-141000"&&What?
id="t-143000"&&Second Man: It's driving itself. 

id="t-147000"&&Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died.
id="t-152000"&&Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?
id="t-158000"&&And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? 

id="t-170000"&&Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
id="t-170000"&&Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute?
id="t-207000"&&You could regain this time.
id="t-209000"&&This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone.
id="t-214000"&&And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. 

id="t-218000"&&Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. 

id="t-228000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-230000"&&(Applause)
