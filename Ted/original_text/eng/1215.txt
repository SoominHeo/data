id="t-0"&&Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 

id="t-6000"&&Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. 

id="t-11000"&&AK: The ancestor of the horse.
id="t-13000"&&Okay, we'll do something with it.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) Hahahaha.
id="t-69000"&&The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called "Faustus in Africa," a Handspring Production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
id="t-82000"&&This production was directed by South African artist and theater director, William Kentridge.
id="t-88000"&&So it needed a very articulate front paw.
id="t-96000"&&But, like all puppets, it has other attributes. 

id="t-99000"&&BJ: One of them is breath, and it kind of breathes. 

id="t-104000"&&AK: Haa haa haaa. 

id="t-109000"&&BJ: Breath is really important for us.
id="t-112000"&&It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage.
id="t-117000"&&It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- 

id="t-120000"&&AK: Oops. 

id="t-122000"&&BJ: From an actor.
id="t-124000"&&Puppets always have to try to be alive.
id="t-127000"&&It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live. 

id="t-133000"&&AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see, and it only lives because you make it.
id="t-140000"&&An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live.
id="t-144000"&&And in a way that's a metaphor for life. 

id="t-146000"&&BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
id="t-149000"&&So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- (Laughter) to turn nouns into verbs. 

id="t-167000"&&AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. 

id="t-178000"&&BJ: Okay so. 

id="t-180000"&&AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes. 

id="t-184000"&&BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. 

id="t-200000"&&AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. 

id="t-203000"&&BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.
id="t-205000"&&And when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971, I hated puppets.
id="t-213000"&&I really thought they were so beneath me.
id="t-216000"&&I wanted to become an avant-garde artist -- and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.
id="t-222000"&&And, in fact, it took about 10 years 

id="t-224000"&&to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form. 

id="t-240000"&&AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company.
id="t-245000"&&And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
id="t-255000"&&It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe. 

id="t-258000"&&BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.
id="t-260000"&&The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure.
id="t-267000"&&It's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. 

id="t-276000"&&AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger.
id="t-284000"&&And he's controlling the ear movement. 

id="t-288000"&&BJ: So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London.
id="t-294000"&&And just around that time, his mother had said, "Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?"

id="t-304000"&&AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.
id="t-306000"&&The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse. 

id="t-310000"&&BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"

id="t-317000"&&AK: It seemed a lovely idea. 

BJ: But it had to ride.
BJ: But it had to ride.

id="t-321000"&&AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) A play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London.
id="t-337000"&&But they agreed to go along with it for a while.
id="t-339000"&&So we began with a test. 

id="t-341000"&&BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander, who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse, and our next-door neighbor Katherine, riding on a ladder.
id="t-352000"&&The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. 

id="t-355000"&&AK: And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
id="t-362000"&&So we made a model.
id="t-364000"&&This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena.
id="t-368000"&&You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. 

id="t-372000"&&BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.
id="t-374000"&&But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. 

id="t-386000"&&AK: We started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated.
id="t-394000"&&We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
id="t-397000"&&And we had a crate built for it.
id="t-399000"&&It had to be shipped to London.
id="t-401000"&&We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. 

id="t-407000"&&BJ: So we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances.
id="t-417000"&&And we sent it off to the National Theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-428000"&&AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. 

id="t-434000"&&BJ: About 40 people. 

id="t-436000"&&AK: We were terrified.
id="t-438000"&&We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
id="t-443000"&&Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype.
id="t-448000"&&This is in the National Theatre studio, the place where they cook new ideas.
id="t-452000"&&It had by no means got the green light yet.
id="t-462000"&&The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick, invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse, which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs, grew up into the big horse.
id="t-473000"&&And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.
id="t-479000"&&And so the show was given the green light.
id="t-482000"&&And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.
id="t-485000"&&Here is the plan. 

id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-491000"&&And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses.
id="t-496000"&&You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
id="t-500000"&&The horses are completely handmade.
id="t-503000"&&There is very little 20th century technology in them.
id="t-506000"&&We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces.
id="t-510000"&&But because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.
id="t-518000"&&So here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in London.
id="t-524000"&&And now we would like to introduce you to Joey.
id="t-529000"&&Joey boy, you there?
id="t-532000"&&Joey.
id="t-535000"&&(Applause) (Applause) Joey.
id="t-578000"&&Joey, come here.
id="t-595000"&&No, no, I haven't got it.
id="t-597000"&&He's got it; it's in his pocket. 

id="t-601000"&&BJ: Joey.
id="t-613000"&&AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
id="t-613000"&&AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
id="t-613000"&&AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
id="t-613000"&&AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
id="t-613000"&&AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
id="t-633000"&&I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud.
id="t-633000"&&I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud.
id="t-640000"&&Here, Craig is working the head.
id="t-643000"&&He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand.
id="t-648000"&&Each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down.
id="t-655000"&&But he also controls the head directly by using his hand.
id="t-660000"&&The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse.
id="t-665000"&&When they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry, depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.
id="t-676000"&&Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side.
id="t-683000"&&Horses' hearing is very important.
id="t-685000"&&It's almost more important than their eyesight.
id="t-689000"&&Over here, Tommy's got what you call the heart position.
id="t-694000"&&He's working the leg.
id="t-696000"&&You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) Horses are so unpredictable.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action.
id="t-723000"&&The hind legs have got the same action. 

id="t-729000"&&BJ: And Mikey also has, in his fingers, the ability to move the tail from left to right, and up and down with the other hand.
id="t-739000"&&And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. 

id="t-744000"&&AK: You want to say something about the breathing? 

id="t-746000"&&BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
id="t-749000"&&Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
id="t-758000"&&But we realized that, if that were to be happening, you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.
id="t-764000"&&So he made a channel in here, and the chest moves up and down in that channel.
id="t-771000"&&So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement, but it feels like breath.
id="t-775000"&&And it's very, very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. 

id="t-785000"&&AK: Other emotional stuff.
id="t-787000"&&If I were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver.
id="t-797000"&&You'll notice, of course, that the puppet is made out of cane lines.
id="t-801000"&&And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space.
id="t-808000"&&But of course, it was the cane is light, the cane is flexible, the cane is durable and the cane is moldable.
id="t-814000"&&And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. 

id="t-817000"&&The skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike.
id="t-830000"&&You see the skeletal structure of it.
id="t-832000"&&Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.
id="t-835000"&&Again, that was a practical consideration.
id="t-838000"&&The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.
id="t-841000"&&They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production.
id="t-846000"&&And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
id="t-849000"&&It's three heads making one character. 

id="t-852000"&&But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.
id="t-893000"&&And plant. 

id="t-898000"&&(Whinny) 

id="t-910000"&&Thank you.
id="t-912000"&&And now just -- (Applause) All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. 

id="t-535000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-535000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-993000"&&(Music) 

id="t-1014000"&&So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. 

id="t-1023000"&&BJ: Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd.
id="t-1029000"&&The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person and ends with a third. 

id="t-1042000"&&AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
id="t-535000"&&(Applause) Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo, Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. 

id="t-535000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-910000"&&Thank you.
id="t-910000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-535000"&&(Applause)
