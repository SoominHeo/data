id="t-0"&&I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
id="t-6000"&&It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business.
id="t-16000"&&And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco.
id="t-20000"&&(Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
id="t-25000"&&This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo.
id="t-30000"&&Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative.
id="t-36000"&&That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
id="t-45000"&&Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression. 

id="t-20000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-52000"&&But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
id="t-61000"&&But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
id="t-65000"&&While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females.
id="t-76000"&&These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.
id="t-52000"&&But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.
id="t-93000"&&They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them. 

id="t-99000"&&The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.
id="t-121000"&&Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
id="t-127000"&&Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
id="t-139000"&&Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. 

id="t-148000"&&Who are these cousins?
id="t-151000"&&We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
id="t-163000"&&Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems -- since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra.
id="t-173000"&&Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives.
id="t-177000"&&Play is not just child's games.
id="t-179000"&&For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance.
id="t-186000"&&It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game.
id="t-191000"&&Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
id="t-206000"&&And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual.
id="t-215000"&&Play is the glue that binds us together. 

id="t-219000"&&Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild.
id="t-226000"&&First, it's a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football.
id="t-232000"&&So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
id="t-239000"&&Have a look what she's doing.
id="t-241000"&&It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls."
id="t-20000"&&(Laughter) Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
id="t-252000"&&Yeah.
id="t-20000"&&(Laughter) So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
id="t-260000"&&And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun. 

id="t-282000"&&But play's a shapeshifter.
id="t-20000"&&(Laughter) Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
id="t-298000"&&And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
id="t-304000"&&I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds.
id="t-313000"&&And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. 

id="t-326000"&&So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present.
id="t-334000"&&But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation.
id="t-346000"&&The secret is that play is the key to these capacities.
id="t-351000"&&In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard.
id="t-355000"&&In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.
id="t-363000"&&But will we make the most of our playfulness?
id="t-366000"&&Play is not frivolous.
id="t-368000"&&Play's essential.
id="t-370000"&&For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw.
id="t-376000"&&In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent. 

id="t-383000"&&And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder. 

id="t-396000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-398000"&&(Applause)
