id="t-0"&&Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
id="t-5000"&&When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
id="t-10000"&&Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. 

id="t-19000"&&I remember my first fire.
id="t-21000"&&I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
id="t-26000"&&But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.
id="t-32000"&&When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
id="t-42000"&&Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames. 

id="t-53000"&&The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.
id="t-53000"&&The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.
id="t-53000"&&The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.
id="t-71000"&&Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
id="t-82000"&&Well, I was next.
id="t-84000"&&The captain waved me over.
id="t-86000"&&He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
id="t-89000"&&I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."
id="t-58000"&&(Laughter) I swear.
id="t-100000"&&So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went -- up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. 

id="t-114000"&&Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero.
id="t-58000"&&(Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door.
id="t-131000"&&We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine.
id="t-139000"&&A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.
id="t-147000"&&The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. 

id="t-58000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-155000"&&In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
id="t-168000"&&And you know what I've learned?
id="t-170000"&&They all matter.
id="t-172000"&&So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait.
id="t-184000"&&Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
id="t-188000"&&If you have something to give, give it now.
id="t-188000"&&If you have something to give, give it now.
id="t-188000"&&If you have something to give, give it now.
id="t-195000"&&Be a mentor. 

id="t-197000"&&Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
id="t-197000"&&Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
id="t-197000"&&Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.

id="t-207000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-209000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-214000"&&Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. 

id="t-209000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-223000"&&Mark Bezos: Thank you.
