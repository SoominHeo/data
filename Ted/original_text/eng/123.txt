id="t-774"&&I'm turning 44 next month, and I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year, a year of fulfillment, realization.
id="t-11532"&&I have that sense, not because of anything particular in store for me, but because I read it would be a good year in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer. 

id="t-22497"&&"He felt his own age, forty-four ..." wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night," "... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man, as if he had arrived."

id="t-37207"&&Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me.
id="t-40295"&&But I also know that he was; for all of us -- you, me, the subject of his book, age more or less in step, proceed from birth along the same great sequence: through the wonders and confinements of childhood; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; the empowerments and millstones of adulthood; the recognitions and resignations of old age.
id="t-68391"&&There are patterns to life, and they are shared.
id="t-72230"&&As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."

id="t-77772"&&We don't simply live these patterns.
id="t-80013"&&We record them, too.
id="t-81766"&&We write them down in books, where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize.
id="t-87669"&&Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will be, too.
id="t-93492"&&So they have for millennia.
id="t-96162"&&As James Salter wrote, "Life passes into pages if it passes into anything."

id="t-102979"&&And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind: if life passed into pages, there were, somewhere, passages written about every age.
id="t-112711"&&If I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative.
id="t-116315"&&I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass.
id="t-127321"&&I was then 37 years old, "an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor.
id="t-135074"&&I was prone to meditating on time and age.
id="t-138322"&&An illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.
id="t-145056"&&And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable, time seeing through what circumstance did not.
id="t-151947"&&It was all a bit disheartening. 

id="t-154413"&&A list, though, would last.
id="t-157334"&&To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting, would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future, whether we made it there or not.
id="t-169574"&&And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed, searching pages and pages for ages and ages.
id="t-177702"&&Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years.
id="t-182624"&&"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations," "sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."

id="t-191989"&&I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative.
id="t-196405"&&For starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly.
id="t-201151"&&Christopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf" to describe a man at 53, only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36. 

id="t-210853"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-213154"&&I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next, and that people may experience the same age differently.
id="t-222045"&&But even so, as the list coalesced, so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror, did the life that I had been living: finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;" emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;" learning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms [I would] not be coming back to."
id="t-248720"&&There I was. 

id="t-251885"&&Of course, there we all are.
id="t-254762"&&Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here, and who today is 85 -- all those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov -- noted to me that, like art and like color, literature helps us to remember what we've experienced. 

id="t-275095"&&And indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather, he nodded in recognition.
id="t-281339"&&He was then 95 and soon to die, which, wrote Roberto Bola√±o, "... is the same as never dying."
id="t-291556"&&And looking back, he said to me that, yes, Proust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die, just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right that at 90, we are sure we will.
id="t-309229"&&It had happened to him, as to them. 

id="t-315479"&&Now the list is done: a hundred years.
id="t-321443"&&And looking back over it, I know that I am not done.
id="t-326800"&&I still have my life to live, still have many more pages to pass into.
id="t-332546"&&And mindful of Mailer, I await 44. 

id="t-336746"&&Thank you. 

id="t-337948"&&(Applause)
