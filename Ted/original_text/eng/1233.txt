id="t-253000"&&We want to play you one more selection.
id="t-256000"&&It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.
id="t-259000"&&And we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart.
id="t-266000"&&This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart, beautiful music, wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.
id="t-273000"&&It was more atonal and twelve-tone.
id="t-276000"&&And he insisted on beautiful music.
id="t-279000"&&So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla.
