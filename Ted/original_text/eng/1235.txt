id="t-0"&&As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked.
id="t-12000"&&The year is 1963.
id="t-15000"&&We're at the ocean.
id="t-17000"&&It's twilight.
id="t-19000"&&We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides.
id="t-26000"&&It's a stretch of beach we know so well.
id="t-30000"&&The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us.
id="t-37000"&&If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes, you might dismiss them as poor and simple.
id="t-45000"&&That would be a mistake.
id="t-48000"&&These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me.
id="t-60000"&&They teach me the names of the winds and the rains, of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.
id="t-68000"&&There's a new moon on the horizon.
id="t-71000"&&Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.
id="t-74000"&&They begin to chant. 

id="t-77000"&&[Hawaiian chant] 

id="t-107000"&&When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them.
id="t-114000"&&They want to teach me about my destiny.
id="t-118000"&&I thought every seven-year-old went through this.
id="t-120000"&&(Laughter) "Baby girl, someday the world will be in trouble.
id="t-129000"&&People will forget their wisdom.
id="t-132000"&&It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance.
id="t-142000"&&You will go far away.
id="t-144000"&&It will sometimes be a lonely road.
id="t-147000"&&We will not be there.
id="t-149000"&&But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers, and you will recognize your ohana, your family.
id="t-159000"&&And it will take all of you.
id="t-162000"&&It will take all of you."
id="t-166000"&&These words, I hold onto all my life.
id="t-171000"&&Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. 

id="t-177000"&&The year is 2007.
id="t-180000"&&I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.
id="t-183000"&&Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide.
id="t-189000"&&It's the home of my mentor.
id="t-191000"&&His name is Pius Mau Piailug.
id="t-193000"&&Mau is a palu, a navigator priest.
id="t-197000"&&He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world.
id="t-202000"&&There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island.
id="t-207000"&&Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments.
id="t-218000"&&They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds.
id="t-230000"&&Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. 

id="t-243000"&&When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest.
id="t-252000"&&In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel.
id="t-256000"&&It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves.
id="t-264000"&&Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body.
id="t-271000"&&It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.
id="t-276000"&&Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. 

id="t-293000"&&The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance.
id="t-301000"&&Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, "Okay, we go."
id="t-314000"&&He saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. 

id="t-320000"&&Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms.
id="t-333000"&&We are in such a critical moment of our collective history.
id="t-341000"&&They have been compared to astronauts -- these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island.
id="t-358000"&&Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space.
id="t-365000"&&The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot.
id="t-374000"&&This is part of our collective narrative.
id="t-377000"&&It's humanity's DNA.
id="t-380000"&&We cannot afford to lose it. 

id="t-383000"&&The year is 2010.
id="t-387000"&&Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted, the world is in trouble.
id="t-396000"&&We live in a society bloated with data, yet starved for wisdom.
id="t-405000"&&We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high.
id="t-416000"&&We must course-correct.
id="t-420000"&&An African shaman said, "Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes."
id="t-435000"&&The link between the past and the future is fragile.
id="t-440000"&&This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle.
id="t-458000"&&I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. 

id="t-474000"&&Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on.
id="t-483000"&&And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them, as potent as the Micronesian navigators, that are going dismissed, that this is a testament to brilliant, brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly.
id="t-511000"&&Because when an elder dies a library is burned, and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze. 

id="t-518000"&&I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate.
id="t-527000"&&And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way.
id="t-534000"&&And this is what he said: "The island is the canoe; the canoe, the island."
id="t-542000"&&And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard.
id="t-554000"&&You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to.
id="t-559000"&&This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
id="t-563000"&&It always was. 

id="t-566000"&&So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers.
id="t-577000"&&True navigation begins in the human heart.
id="t-582000"&&It's the most important map of all.
id="t-585000"&&Together, may we journey well. 

id="t-588000"&&(Applause)
