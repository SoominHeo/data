id="t-1000"&&Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- [were] fighting.
id="t-6000"&&So there was no job, no food.
id="t-10000"&&Children, most of them, became very malnourished, like this.
id="t-16000"&&Deqo Mohamed: So as you know, always in a civil war, the ones affected most [are] the women and children.
id="t-23000"&&So our patients are women and children.
id="t-26000"&&And they are in our backyard.
id="t-26000"&&And they are in our backyard.
id="t-26000"&&And they are in our backyard.
id="t-30000"&&That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children.
id="t-30000"&&That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children.
id="t-30000"&&That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children.
id="t-40000"&&HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help.
id="t-46000"&&There is no government to protect them.
id="t-49000"&&DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less.
id="t-54000"&&But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses, and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.
id="t-63000"&&But we take the severe ones, and we reschedule the other ones the next day.
id="t-68000"&&It is very tough.
id="t-70000"&&And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children; it's the women who come into the hospitals; it's the women [are] building the houses.
id="t-77000"&&That's their house.
id="t-77000"&&That's their house.
id="t-77000"&&That's their house.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic.
id="t-101000"&&Would you explain the rules for admission?
id="t-104000"&&HA: The people who are coming to us, we are welcoming.
id="t-108000"&&We are sharing with them whatever we have.
id="t-112000"&&But there are only two rules.
id="t-114000"&&First rule: there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society.
id="t-122000"&&[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.
id="t-125000"&&The second: no man can beat his wife.
id="t-129000"&&If he beat, we will put [him] in jail, and we will call the eldest people.
id="t-136000"&&Until they identify this case, we'll never release him.
id="t-141000"&&That's our two rules.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) The other thing that I have realized, that the woman is the most strong person all over the world.
id="t-156000"&&Because the last 20 years, the Somali woman has stood up.
id="t-161000"&&They were the leaders, and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations.
id="t-169000"&&We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war.
id="t-173000"&&We can reconcile.
id="t-175000"&&We can do everything.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope, and the men are only killing in Somalia.
id="t-188000"&&So we came up with these two rules.
id="t-190000"&&In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.
id="t-195000"&&So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife.
id="t-199000"&&And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail.
id="t-203000"&&So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them.
id="t-214000"&&PM: You're running a medical clinic.
id="t-216000"&&It brought much, much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it.
id="t-221000"&&You're also running a civil society.
id="t-223000"&&You've created your own rules, in which women and children are getting a different sense of security.
id="t-230000"&&Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi, and your decision, Dr. Mohamed, to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances.
id="t-242000"&&HA: My age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having, at that time, government, law and order.
id="t-253000"&&But one day, I went to the hospital -- my mother was sick -- and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors, how they [are] committed to help the sick people.
id="t-266000"&&I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor.
id="t-270000"&&My mother died, unfortunately, when I was 12 years [old].
id="t-274000"&&Then my father allowed me to proceed [with] my hope.
id="t-281000"&&My mother died in [a] gynecology complication, so I decided to become a gynecology specialist.
id="t-290000"&&That's why I became a doctor.
id="t-293000"&&So Dr. Deqo has to explain.
id="t-296000"&&DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.
id="t-302000"&&Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter.
id="t-306000"&&I loved it, but it didn't work.
id="t-308000"&&When the war broke out -- civil war -- I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help, and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children.
id="t-321000"&&And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.
id="t-324000"&&(Laughter) So I went to Russia, and my mother also, [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.
id="t-330000"&&So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.
id="t-337000"&&So that's how I decided [to do] the same.
id="t-339000"&&My sister was different.
id="t-339000"&&My sister was different.
id="t-339000"&&My sister was different.
id="t-343000"&&She graduated in Russia also.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when I was 16, and my sister was 11, when the civil war broke out.
id="t-357000"&&So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s -- that's what made us go back and work for them.
id="t-367000"&&PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations?
id="t-376000"&&HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation, very dangerous.
id="t-383000"&&And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them.
id="t-391000"&&Most people fled abroad.
id="t-395000"&&But I remained with those people, and I was trying to do something -- [any] little thing I [could] do.
id="t-404000"&&I succeeded in my place.
id="t-407000"&&Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other, who are not fighting.
id="t-416000"&&But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people.
id="t-424000"&&And I'm thankful for my daughters.
id="t-427000"&&When they come to me, they help me to treat the people, to help.
id="t-433000"&&They do everything for them.
id="t-435000"&&They have done what I desire to do for them.
id="t-439000"&&PM: What's the best part of working with your mother, and the most challenging part for you?
id="t-446000"&&DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.
id="t-449000"&&She always expects us to do more.
id="t-452000"&&And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it.
id="t-456000"&&That's the best part.
id="t-458000"&&She shows us, trains us how to do and how to be better [people] and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day, 10, 20 surgeries, and still you have to manage the camp -- that's how she trains us.
id="t-474000"&&It is not like beautiful offices here, 20 patients, you're tired.
id="t-478000"&&You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage.
id="t-484000"&&PM: But you do it for good reasons.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) Wait.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) Wait.
id="t-492000"&&HA: Thank you.
id="t-494000"&&DM: Thank you.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) HA: Thank you very much.
id="t-90000"&&(Applause) HA: Thank you very much.
