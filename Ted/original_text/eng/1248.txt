id="t-3000"&&I will not dance to your war drum.
id="t-7000"&&I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.
id="t-10000"&&I will not dance to that beating.
id="t-12000"&&I know that beat.
id="t-14000"&&It is lifeless.
id="t-16000"&&I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
id="t-19000"&&It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched.
id="t-25000"&&I will not dance to your drummed-up war.
id="t-28000"&&I will not pop, spin, break for you.
id="t-31000"&&I will not hate for you or even hate you.
id="t-35000"&&I will not kill for you.
id="t-37000"&&Especially I will not die for you.
id="t-41000"&&I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.
id="t-44000"&&I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing.
id="t-48000"&&Everyone can be wrong.
id="t-50000"&&Life is a right, not collateral or casual.
id="t-54000"&&I will not forget where I come from.
id="t-56000"&&I will craft my own drum.
id="t-58000"&&Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing.
id="t-62000"&&Our humming will be drumming.
id="t-64000"&&I will not be played.
id="t-66000"&&I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.
id="t-70000"&&I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.
id="t-74000"&&This heartbeat is louder than death.
id="t-77000"&&Your war drum ain't louder than this breath.
id="t-77000"&&Your war drum ain't louder than this breath.

id="t-88000"&&A bunch of pacifists.
id="t-91000"&&Confused, aspiring pacifists.
id="t-94000"&&I understand. 

id="t-98000"&&I've been wrong a lot lately.
id="t-103000"&&Like a lot.
id="t-105000"&&So I couldn't figure out what to read today.
id="t-110000"&&I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.
id="t-113000"&&What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of.
id="t-124000"&&Poetry does that.
id="t-124000"&&Poetry does that.
id="t-124000"&&Poetry does that.

id="t-129000"&&So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now.
id="t-133000"&&But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here.
id="t-140000"&&Hold her now with you.
id="t-147000"&&You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.
id="t-149000"&&Are you holding her? 

id="t-154000"&&This is "Break Clustered."

id="t-158000"&&All holy history banned.
id="t-162000"&&Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.
id="t-166000"&&But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence.
id="t-174000"&&Whose son shall it be?

id="t-186000"&&We mourn women, complicated.
id="t-188000"&&Bitches get beat daily.
id="t-190000"&&Profits made, prophets ignored.
id="t-193000"&&War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.
id="t-196000"&&All colors run, none of us solid.
id="t-196000"&&All colors run, none of us solid.
id="t-196000"&&All colors run, none of us solid.
id="t-202000"&&I live cycles of light and darkness.
id="t-205000"&&Rhythm is half silence.
id="t-207000"&&I see now, I never was one and not the other.
id="t-210000"&&Sickness, health, tender violence.
id="t-214000"&&I think now I never was pure.
id="t-216000"&&Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant -- still am.
id="t-222000"&&Human contracted itself blind, malignant.
id="t-225000"&&I never was pure.
id="t-227000"&&Girl spoiled before ripened.
id="t-230000"&&Language can't math me.
id="t-232000"&&I experience exponentially.

id="t-255000"&&One woman gives birth to borders.
id="t-257000"&&One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.
id="t-260000"&&One woman never did.
id="t-262000"&&Where do refugee hearts go?
id="t-265000"&&Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.
id="t-270000"&&Faced with absence.
id="t-272000"&&We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all.
id="t-276000"&&My spine curves spiral.
id="t-279000"&&Precipice running to and running from human beings.
id="t-283000"&&Cluster bombs left behind.
id="t-285000"&&De facto landmines.
id="t-287000"&&A smoldering grief.
id="t-289000"&&Harvest contaminated tobacco.
id="t-292000"&&Harvest bombs.
id="t-294000"&&Harvest baby teeth.
id="t-296000"&&Harvest palms, smoke.

id="t-302000"&&Resolutions, smoke.
id="t-305000"&&Salvation, smoke.
id="t-308000"&&Redemption, smoke.
id="t-310000"&&Breathe.
id="t-312000"&&Do not fear what has blown up.
id="t-318000"&&If you must, fear the unexploded. 

id="t-325000"&&Thank you.
