id="t-1000"&&I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.
id="t-18000"&&As a child, I had two passions.
id="t-21000"&&One was a passion for rodents.
id="t-24000"&&I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels.
id="t-30000"&&You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
id="t-33000"&&(Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa.
id="t-38000"&&Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity.
id="t-54000"&&Africa was truly fascinating for me. 

id="t-56000"&&I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries.
id="t-68000"&&I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode.
id="t-80000"&&I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines.
id="t-85000"&&We're talking '95 now.
id="t-88000"&&Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true.
id="t-96000"&&As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land.
id="t-102000"&&Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world.
id="t-113000"&&We chose rats. 

id="t-115000"&&Why would you choose rats?
id="t-117000"&&Because, aren't they vermin?
id="t-119000"&&Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures.
id="t-127000"&&And actually, our product -- what you see here.
id="t-130000"&&There's a target somewhere here.
id="t-132000"&&You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.
id="t-138000"&&There, the animal finds a mine.
id="t-140000"&&It scratches on the soil.
id="t-142000"&&And the animal comes back for a food reward.
id="t-145000"&&Very, very simple.
id="t-147000"&&Very sustainable in this environment.
id="t-150000"&&Here, the animal gets its food reward.
id="t-153000"&&And that's how it works.
id="t-145000"&&Very, very simple. 

id="t-157000"&&Now why would you use rats?
id="t-159000"&&Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.
id="t-164000"&&Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species.
id="t-171000"&&They're extremely sensitive to smell.
id="t-174000"&&Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it.
id="t-180000"&&Now how do we communicate with rats?
id="t-182000"&&Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.
id="t-191000"&&A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
id="t-197000"&&First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
id="t-204000"&&Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.
id="t-222000"&&Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
id="t-225000"&&It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes. 

id="t-231000"&&Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.
id="t-237000"&&In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.
id="t-242000"&&They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.
id="t-250000"&&This consists of 400 square meters.
id="t-252000"&&There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.
id="t-264000"&&If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.
id="t-273000"&&Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. 

id="t-280000"&&This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows.
id="t-288000"&&And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
id="t-291000"&&They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.
id="t-297000"&&Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up.
id="t-306000"&&But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down.
id="t-323000"&&Question of scale.
id="t-325000"&&If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger.
id="t-329000"&&We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
id="t-332000"&&Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology.
id="t-340000"&&They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. 

id="t-351000"&&But let me bring you to a very different problem.
id="t-354000"&&And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection.
id="t-366000"&&Especially in Africa where T.B.
id="t-366000"&&Especially in Africa where T.B.
id="t-376000"&&Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
id="t-383000"&&In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B.
id="t-383000"&&In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B.
id="t-383000"&&In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B.
id="t-393000"&&It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B.
id="t-393000"&&It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B.
id="t-405000"&&And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
id="t-414000"&&You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives. 

id="t-419000"&&So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B.
id="t-424000"&&is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar.
id="t-431000"&&Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B.
id="t-431000"&&Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B.
id="t-446000"&&So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row.
id="t-465000"&&This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.
id="t-471000"&&We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there. 

id="t-478000"&&So how does it work?
id="t-480000"&&You have a cassette with 10 samples.
id="t-482000"&&You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
id="t-485000"&&An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
id="t-490000"&&Here it's already at the third sample.
id="t-493000"&&This is a positive sample.
id="t-497000"&&It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
id="t-502000"&&And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative.
id="t-512000"&&Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.
id="t-524000"&&A cage like this -- (Applause) A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples.
id="t-546000"&&Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. 

id="t-559000"&&But let's stick first to tuberculosis.
id="t-561000"&&I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done.
id="t-575000"&&Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
id="t-578000"&&And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.
id="t-589000"&&Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent.
id="t-602000"&&So this is really considerable.
id="t-604000"&&Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives.
id="t-614000"&&At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. 

id="t-617000"&&The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.
id="t-621000"&&And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds.
id="t-629000"&&So, to standardize this.
id="t-631000"&&Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.
id="t-643000"&&To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
id="t-646000"&&Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on.
id="t-658000"&&This is in a prototype stage.
id="t-660000"&&We don't have a working system here yet. 

id="t-663000"&&To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people.
id="t-670000"&&It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.
id="t-683000"&&So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human.
id="t-700000"&&And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. 

id="t-706000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-526000"&&(Applause)
