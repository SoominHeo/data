id="t-3000"&&Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 

id="t-9000"&&(Music) 

id="t-174000"&&♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ 

id="t-318000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-329000"&&All right.
id="t-331000"&&So, I wanted to do something special today.
id="t-333000"&&I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.
id="t-339000"&&And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished.
id="t-348000"&&(Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it.
id="t-354000"&&Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms.
id="t-358000"&&And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here.
id="t-364000"&&They're feedback loops.
id="t-366000"&&And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound.
id="t-378000"&&And I'm going to demonstrate for you.
id="t-348000"&&(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you.
id="t-348000"&&(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you.

id="t-388000"&&♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- (Feedback) 

id="t-329000"&&All right.
id="t-329000"&&All right.

id="t-422000"&&And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay.
id="t-431000"&&There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly.
id="t-439000"&&So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one?
id="t-450000"&&Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person.
id="t-463000"&&And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 

id="t-469000"&&Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.
id="t-477000"&&And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs.
id="t-483000"&&So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody.
id="t-488000"&&And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.
id="t-499000"&&And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves.
id="t-503000"&&That's what it feels like to me.
id="t-505000"&&It's not pleasant.
id="t-507000"&&I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.
id="t-348000"&&(Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying.
id="t-516000"&&So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.
id="t-520000"&&Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible.
id="t-524000"&&That's the thing.
id="t-526000"&&So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible.
id="t-544000"&&And that's what the song is asking.
id="t-329000"&&All right.
id="t-550000"&&It doesn't have a name yet. 

id="t-9000"&&(Music) 

id="t-668000"&&♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫ ♫ You've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ No one can break your heart ♫ ♫ So you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you wring it out ♫ ♫ And you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ (Applause) 

id="t-738000"&&Thanks.
id="t-318000"&&(Applause) All right.
id="t-318000"&&(Applause) All right.
id="t-318000"&&(Applause) All right.
id="t-750000"&&You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research.
id="t-759000"&&But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit.
id="t-318000"&&(Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called "Weather Systems."

id="t-9000"&&(Music) 

id="t-792000"&&♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ 

id="t-738000"&&Thanks. 

id="t-318000"&&(Applause)
