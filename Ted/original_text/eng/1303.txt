id="t-0"&&Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught.
id="t-6000"&&The who and the why are what's important to me.
id="t-8000"&&I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.
id="t-10000"&&I want to know how I impact them.
id="t-12000"&&I want to know how they impact me.
id="t-14000"&&I want to know why they fish.
id="t-16000"&&I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living.
id="t-20000"&&Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem.
id="t-30000"&&It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. 

id="t-34000"&&So what do we call this?
id="t-36000"&&I think we call it restorative seafood.
id="t-39000"&&Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.
id="t-46000"&&Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency.
id="t-58000"&&It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. 

id="t-65000"&&Wallet guides -- standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world -- are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.
id="t-73000"&&Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
id="t-76000"&&The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow.
id="t-81000"&&But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list.
id="t-85000"&&We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red.
id="t-92000"&&But what if we eat only in the green list?
id="t-95000"&&You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here -- comes from sustainable stocks.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.
id="t-100000"&&Pole caught -- no bycatch.

id="t-108000"&&What's the context of this meal?
id="t-110000"&&Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?
id="t-113000"&&Do I do this three times a week?
id="t-115000"&&I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors.
id="t-123000"&&The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this.
id="t-128000"&&Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
id="t-128000"&&Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
id="t-128000"&&Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
id="t-128000"&&Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
id="t-128000"&&Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
id="t-138000"&&Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem?
id="t-142000"&&Well folks, we have a protein problem.
id="t-144000"&&We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost.
id="t-150000"&&The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
id="t-153000"&&We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.
id="t-157000"&&And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. 

id="t-161000"&&So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs.
id="t-166000"&&Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
id="t-173000"&&Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans.
id="t-177000"&&Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
id="t-179000"&&Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue.
id="t-185000"&&We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all.
id="t-190000"&&But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
id="t-193000"&&The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
id="t-199000"&&It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake.
id="t-212000"&&Whooo!
id="t-214000"&&This is an easy sell.
id="t-216000"&&And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. 

id="t-221000"&&Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat.
id="t-227000"&&Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat.
id="t-232000"&&There's a pattern here.
id="t-234000"&&Forget nuclear holocaust; it's the fork that we have to worry about.
id="t-239000"&&We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.
id="t-246000"&&So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
id="t-249000"&&And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food.
id="t-253000"&&Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
id="t-258000"&&So let's start there. 

id="t-260000"&&There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.
id="t-263000"&&Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
id="t-268000"&&But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters.
id="t-274000"&&Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.
id="t-280000"&&We have eco-friendly shrimp.
id="t-282000"&&We can make them; we have that technology.
id="t-284000"&&But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
id="t-288000"&&It doesn't work.
id="t-290000"&&Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood.
id="t-295000"&&While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
id="t-301000"&&Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood.
id="t-309000"&&That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
id="t-312000"&&But it's not all about the seafood.
id="t-314000"&&It's about the way that we look at our plates. 

id="t-317000"&&As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
id="t-322000"&&A couple things happened.
id="t-324000"&&I made more money.
id="t-326000"&&People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
id="t-331000"&&People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals.
id="t-336000"&&People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein.
id="t-341000"&&They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
id="t-341000"&&They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
id="t-324000"&&I made more money.
id="t-346000"&&This is great.
id="t-348000"&&Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. 

id="t-357000"&&One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served -- small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.
id="t-365000"&&Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.
id="t-370000"&&We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options.
id="t-376000"&&This is what we need to favor.
id="t-378000"&&This is what the green list says.
id="t-380000"&&But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. 

id="t-383000"&&But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?
id="t-390000"&&Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
id="t-393000"&&It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go.
id="t-397000"&&Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
id="t-397000"&&Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
id="t-397000"&&Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
id="t-403000"&&Put it on four plates.
id="t-405000"&&Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have, light the candles and celebrate it.
id="t-412000"&&Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
id="t-414000"&&Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe. 

id="t-421000"&&I expect a lot from food.
id="t-423000"&&I expect health and joy and family and community.
id="t-427000"&&I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests.
id="t-435000"&&I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
id="t-437000"&&And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents.
id="t-442000"&&I remember well the meals of my childhood.
id="t-444000"&&They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch, usually rice.
id="t-450000"&&This is still how I largely eat today.
id="t-453000"&&I get sick when I go to steakhouses.
id="t-456000"&&I get the meat sweats.
id="t-458000"&&It's like a hangover from protein.
id="t-460000"&&It's disgusting.
id="t-463000"&&But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans, I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right.
id="t-476000"&&Eat your vegetables.
id="t-479000"&&It's pretty straightforward. 

id="t-481000"&&So what are we looking for in a meal?
id="t-483000"&&Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body.
id="t-488000"&&For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.
id="t-493000"&&For family, I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories.
id="t-499000"&&For community though, we start at the very beginning.
id="t-502000"&&There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact.
id="t-506000"&&So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it.
id="t-512000"&&We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.
id="t-516000"&&But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner.
id="t-525000"&&So if we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest, we can begin to celebrate, we can begin to restore.
id="t-534000"&&We need to savor vegetables.
id="t-536000"&&We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
id="t-539000"&&And we need to save dinner. 

id="t-541000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-543000"&&(Applause)
