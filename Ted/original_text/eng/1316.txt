id="t-1000"&&Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
id="t-5000"&&I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
id="t-8000"&&It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
id="t-12000"&&So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
id="t-15000"&&But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
id="t-21000"&&It will bring all of your family together.
id="t-25000"&&You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years.
id="t-32000"&&Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.
id="t-37000"&&It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. 

id="t-40000"&&It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith.
id="t-45000"&&You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.
id="t-49000"&&You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
id="t-52000"&&You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.
id="t-59000"&&And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing.
id="t-66000"&&You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
id="t-69000"&&Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
id="t-72000"&&People will say to you, "You look great.
id="t-72000"&&People will say to you, "You look great.
id="t-77000"&&And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. 

id="t-82000"&&You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled.
id="t-88000"&&Your life will have new meaning.
id="t-91000"&&Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.
id="t-98000"&&The price?
id="t-100000"&&$55,000, and that's an incredible deal. 

id="t-106000"&&By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one.
id="t-111000"&&Does Amazon carry it?
id="t-113000"&&Does it have the Apple logo on it?
id="t-115000"&&Is there a waiting list?
id="t-118000"&&Not likely.
id="t-120000"&&This gift came to me about five months ago.
id="t-123000"&&It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
id="t-128000"&&And this, and then this.
id="t-134000"&&It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving. 

id="t-144000"&&And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
id="t-148000"&&I'm not sure you'd want it.
id="t-150000"&&But I wouldn't change my experience.
id="t-153000"&&It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. 

id="t-160000"&&So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift. 

id="t-173000"&&(Applause)
