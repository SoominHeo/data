id="t-0"&&Welcome to Thailand.
id="t-3000"&&Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago, the country was very, very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
id="t-11000"&&We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program.
id="t-19000"&&But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities.
id="t-28000"&&So basically, no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive.
id="t-33000"&&So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning.
id="t-38000"&&Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
id="t-41000"&&Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. 

id="t-45000"&&In my country, that was the case in 1974.
id="t-48000"&&Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
id="t-52000"&&There was just no future.
id="t-54000"&&We needed to reduce the population growth rate.
id="t-56000"&&So we said, "Let's do it."
id="t-56000"&&So we said, "Let's do it."
id="t-56000"&&So we said, "Let's do it."
id="t-65000"&&We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question.
id="t-69000"&&We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women, and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill.
id="t-76000"&&That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country. 

id="t-80000"&&What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
id="t-85000"&&No, we decided to do a bit more.
id="t-87000"&&So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
id="t-90000"&&Actually, below that yellow sign -- I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was "Coca-Cola" there.
id="t-97000"&&We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
id="t-100000"&&And no difference, the people they chose were the people we chose.
id="t-105000"&&They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
id="t-112000"&&So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country.
id="t-112000"&&So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country.
id="t-112000"&&So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country.
id="t-122000"&&Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women, selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people, you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. 

id="t-136000"&&And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist.
id="t-144000"&&We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
id="t-146000"&&I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family.
id="t-158000"&&And this picture was sent throughout the country.
id="t-160000"&&So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
id="t-163000"&&And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
id="t-166000"&&It's been blessed."
id="t-168000"&&That was their perception. 

id="t-170000"&&And then we went to teachers.
id="t-172000"&&You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place.
id="t-180000"&&So we went to the teachers.
id="t-182000"&&Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy.
id="t-189000"&&And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
id="t-191000"&&If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-194000"&&Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) Again, education, class entertainment.
id="t-207000"&&And the kids were doing it in school too.
id="t-209000"&&We had relay races with condoms, we had children's condom-blowing championship.
id="t-213000"&&And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
id="t-218000"&&In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend. 

id="t-224000"&&We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning.
id="t-233000"&&If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
id="t-235000"&&If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
id="t-237000"&&And that was run by them.
id="t-239000"&&And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.
id="t-243000"&&It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
id="t-248000"&&And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves.
id="t-252000"&&And you probably hardly see a Thai man there, it's always women, women, women, women.
id="t-257000"&&And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And this is on the Fourth of July.
id="t-271000"&&We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his [unclear].
id="t-280000"&&And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And since it was near lunch time, they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
id="t-291000"&&Of course, it must be American cola.
id="t-293000"&&You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
id="t-295000"&&And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."
id="t-298000"&&And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID.
id="t-307000"&&Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
id="t-312000"&&It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
id="t-312000"&&It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
id="t-312000"&&It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.

id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-319000"&&And what happened?
id="t-321000"&&In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
id="t-328000"&&You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing.
id="t-333000"&&I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends.
id="t-338000"&&And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
id="t-338000"&&And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
id="t-338000"&&And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
id="t-343000"&&But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. 

id="t-347000"&&Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS.
id="t-353000"&&But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
id="t-356000"&&So our work wasn't affected.
id="t-358000"&&So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
id="t-361000"&&So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
id="t-365000"&&They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government.
id="t-369000"&&So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV.
id="t-373000"&&And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes.
id="t-373000"&&And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes.
id="t-373000"&&And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes.
id="t-378000"&&And that's when we went onto the airwaves.
id="t-381000"&&And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
id="t-383000"&&And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
id="t-386000"&&He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
id="t-388000"&&So I said, "Okay."
id="t-390000"&&He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold. 

id="t-394000"&&Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education -- everyone -- and we said the public, institutions, religious institutions, schools -- everyone was involved.
id="t-404000"&&And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV.
id="t-408000"&&And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money.
id="t-414000"&&So they were happy with that.
id="t-416000"&&And then AIDS education in all schools, starting from university.
id="t-420000"&&And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
id="t-423000"&&And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific.
id="t-427000"&&And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa.
id="t-433000"&&And then we went down one more step.
id="t-435000"&&These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade -- going to every household in the village, every household in the whole of Thailand, giving AIDS information and a condom to every household, given by these young kids.
id="t-447000"&&And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives, and this was a lifesaver.
id="t-453000"&&And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."

id="t-455000"&&So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
id="t-459000"&&So they all trained.
id="t-461000"&&And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots.
id="t-461000"&&And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots.
id="t-461000"&&And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots.
id="t-470000"&&In every country, every program, you need a symbol, and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere, everywhere.
id="t-483000"&&In taxis, you get condoms.
id="t-485000"&&And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
id="t-501000"&&Imagine if they had condoms, giving out to all sorts of people.
id="t-505000"&&And then, new change, we had hair bands, clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. 

id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-515000"&&And these were the condoms that we introduced.
id="t-520000"&&One says, "Weapon of mass protection."
id="t-522000"&&We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
id="t-530000"&&And then it says here, with the American flag, "Don't leave home without it."
id="t-534000"&&But I have some to give out afterward.
id="t-537000"&&But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized, so be very careful.
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And so you can see that condoms can do so many things.
id="t-548000"&&Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
id="t-553000"&&Stop global warming; use condoms.
id="t-557000"&&And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection.
id="t-563000"&&And let the next Olympics save some lives.
id="t-566000"&&Why just run around?
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God, so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."
id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people.
id="t-584000"&&We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment. 

id="t-589000"&&And then what happened?
id="t-591000"&&After all this time, everybody joined in.
id="t-594000"&&According to the U.N., new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent, and according to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved.
id="t-603000"&&Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
id="t-606000"&&So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
id="t-609000"&&90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
id="t-611000"&&There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight.
id="t-616000"&&So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
id="t-619000"&&We all need to help. 

id="t-621000"&&And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community.
id="t-630000"&&Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit.
id="t-635000"&&Those are the things to be provided by the business community.
id="t-638000"&&We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people.
id="t-643000"&&The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
id="t-645000"&&So, that was done.
id="t-647000"&&The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting.
id="t-651000"&&It's not a free gift.
id="t-653000"&&They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank.
id="t-657000"&&Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in. 

id="t-663000"&&And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
id="t-666000"&&And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right.
id="t-673000"&&Access to credit must be a human right.
id="t-675000"&&Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
id="t-678000"&&And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
id="t-680000"&&Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA," teaching people how to do business so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
id="t-687000"&&These are some of the businesses: mushrooms, crabs, vegetables, trees, fruits, and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits; this is a village sponsored by Nike.
id="t-699000"&&They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
id="t-701000"&&Make these better, because we can afford them."
id="t-705000"&&And then we have silk, Thai silk.
id="t-707000"&&Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
id="t-713000"&&So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me.
id="t-717000"&&And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms."
id="t-722000"&&See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
id="t-725000"&&That's the difference.
id="t-727000"&&Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms?
id="t-731000"&&You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. 

id="t-736000"&&And then now, finally in education, we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
id="t-745000"&&We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
id="t-748000"&&And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development.
id="t-752000"&&Re-do the school, make it serve the community needs.
id="t-757000"&&And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo.
id="t-761000"&&This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
id="t-764000"&&And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome.
id="t-770000"&&And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables. 

id="t-774000"&&And then, finally, I firmly believe, if we want the MDGs to work -- the Millennium Development Goals -- we need to add family planning to it.
id="t-783000"&&Of course, child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it's underutilized.
id="t-790000"&&So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
id="t-792000"&&And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives.
id="t-797000"&&And then, finally, that is our network.
id="t-800000"&&And these are our Thai tulips. 

id="t-202000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-805000"&&Thank you very much indeed. 

id="t-807000"&&(Applause)
