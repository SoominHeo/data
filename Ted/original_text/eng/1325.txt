id="t-1000"&&The Hindus say, "Nada brahma," one translation of which is, "The world is sound."
id="t-6000"&&And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.
id="t-9000"&&In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.
id="t-12000"&&Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
id="t-15000"&&So you are, in fact, a chord -- each of you an individual chord.
id="t-19000"&&One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony.
id="t-23000"&&Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things.
id="t-23000"&&Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things.
id="t-28000"&&Incidentally, we see just one octave.
id="t-31000"&&Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.
id="t-33000"&&They work even when you sleep.
id="t-35000"&&The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.
id="t-40000"&&The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. 

id="t-44000"&&Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening.
id="t-48000"&&Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at -- it's a relationship with sound.
id="t-55000"&&And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
id="t-57000"&&For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from?
id="t-62000"&&Here are two of them.
id="t-64000"&&Reductive listening is listening "for."
id="t-66000"&&It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant.
id="t-71000"&&Men typically listen reductively.
id="t-73000"&&So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
id="t-73000"&&So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
id="t-73000"&&So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
id="t-73000"&&So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
id="t-77000"&&That's the way we talk, right guys? 

id="t-79000"&&Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for."
id="t-83000"&&It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey.
id="t-87000"&&Women typically listen expansively.
id="t-89000"&&If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time.
id="t-93000"&&(Laughter) Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk, practice expansive listening, and you can transform your relationships. 

id="t-102000"&&The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise, surrounding us all the time.
id="t-108000"&&Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe.
id="t-117000"&&Two percent of the population of Europe -- that's 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that.
id="t-125000"&&Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe.
id="t-129000"&&It's a really big problem. 

id="t-131000"&&Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it, you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.
id="t-135000"&&These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.
id="t-138000"&&It looks a bit like this.
id="t-140000"&&The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues.
id="t-145000"&&The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined: "schizophonia."
id="t-150000"&&It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear.
id="t-154000"&&So, we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us.
id="t-159000"&&I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. 

id="t-163000"&&The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression.
id="t-167000"&&We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this.
id="t-171000"&&Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.
id="t-174000"&&(Music) And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.
id="t-174000"&&(Music) I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two.
id="t-191000"&&There is a cost of compression.
id="t-193000"&&It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.
id="t-195000"&&You're having to imagine it.
id="t-197000"&&It's not good for you in the long run. 

id="t-199000"&&The third problem with headphones is this: deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder.
id="t-204000"&&Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another, but really worryingly, 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of American teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse.
id="t-218000"&&One study at an American university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse.
id="t-227000"&&We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.
id="t-230000"&&Now that's a really serious problem. 

id="t-232000"&&I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children, please.
id="t-236000"&&Professional hearing protectors are great; I use some all the time.
id="t-240000"&&If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.
id="t-245000"&&If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice, it's too loud.
id="t-249000"&&And thirdly, if you're in bad sound, it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.
id="t-253000"&&Protect your ears in that way. 

id="t-255000"&&Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.
id="t-258000"&&WWB: Wind, water, birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events, all of it very healthy, all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.
id="t-272000"&&Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.
id="t-278000"&&Silence is beautiful.
id="t-280000"&&The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence.
id="t-284000"&&I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art.
id="t-290000"&&Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.
id="t-293000"&&It's fun to get into designing with sound.
id="t-295000"&&If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
id="t-298000"&&Sound design is the future, and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. 

id="t-303000"&&I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health.
id="t-308000"&&First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer.
id="t-313000"&&Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
id="t-319000"&&Sound healing is a wonderful modality.
id="t-321000"&&It's been around for thousands of years.
id="t-323000"&&I do urge you to explore this.
id="t-325000"&&There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions.
id="t-325000"&&There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions.
id="t-325000"&&There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions.
id="t-336000"&&Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.
id="t-338000"&&There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. 

id="t-342000"&&And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved.
id="t-346000"&&First of all, listen consciously.
id="t-348000"&&I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.
id="t-350000"&&It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.
id="t-353000"&&Secondly, get in touch with making some sound -- create sound.
id="t-358000"&&The voice is the instrument we all play, and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice?
id="t-358000"&&The voice is the instrument we all play, and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice?
id="t-365000"&&Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.
id="t-368000"&&You can do this in groups as well.
id="t-370000"&&It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia; to make music and sound in a group of people, whichever style you enjoy particularly.
id="t-377000"&&And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
id="t-377000"&&And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
id="t-377000"&&And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
id="t-381000"&&Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work.
id="t-385000"&&And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. 

id="t-391000"&&So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound.
id="t-396000"&&My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things, we will take a very big step in that direction.
id="t-403000"&&So I urge you to take that path. 

id="t-406000"&&I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.
id="t-408000"&&I wish you sound health. 

id="t-410000"&&(Applause)
