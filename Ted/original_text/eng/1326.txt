id="t-1000"&&I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable?
id="t-9000"&&Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now.
id="t-17000"&&And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual.
id="t-21000"&&On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.
id="t-25000"&&It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
id="t-28000"&&So the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?
id="t-32000"&&That's my question.
id="t-34000"&&If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
id="t-41000"&&The question is: what's next? 

id="t-44000"&&Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
id="t-47000"&&The first one is mass.
id="t-49000"&&As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.
id="t-53000"&&So, could we use that in mobile phones?
id="t-56000"&&Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
id="t-58000"&&It is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around, and you can feel where it's heavy.
id="t-65000"&&We shift the gravitational center of it.
id="t-68000"&&For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.
id="t-73000"&&So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
id="t-79000"&&Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city.
id="t-84000"&&It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right.
id="t-84000"&&It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right.
id="t-84000"&&It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right.
id="t-89000"&&And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time; you have your eyes free to see the city. 

id="t-94000"&&Now, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape.
id="t-99000"&&We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.
id="t-102000"&&So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- it's thick.
id="t-192000"&&(Laughter) So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
id="t-115000"&&Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape.
id="t-121000"&&We can play with the shape itself.
id="t-123000"&&For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
id="t-130000"&&It's like tapered to the downside.
id="t-132000"&&If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
id="t-136000"&&It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands.
id="t-142000"&&It's fairly simple.
id="t-144000"&&Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself.
id="t-150000"&&So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
id="t-157000"&&You can't see it, but it's there."
id="t-159000"&&And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. 

id="t-162000"&&The shape is the second thing.
id="t-165000"&&The third thing operates on a different level.
id="t-168000"&&As humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great.
id="t-173000"&&Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
id="t-176000"&&Think of a hamster in the pocket.
id="t-178000"&&Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
id="t-181000"&&Let me show you the living mobile phone.
id="t-184000"&&So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic.
id="t-192000"&&(Laughter) And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
id="t-196000"&&Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.
id="t-192000"&&(Laughter) How do we calm it down?
id="t-205000"&&You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again.
id="t-210000"&&So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want. 

id="t-212000"&&So, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.
id="t-216000"&&And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.
id="t-220000"&&What's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future; rather than that, technology, a bit more human. 

id="t-232000"&&(Applause)
