id="t-0"&&Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?
id="t-6000"&&I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle Ã  roue."
id="t-10000"&&And in Spanish, "zanfona."
id="t-12000"&&And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
id="t-14000"&&Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle. 

id="t-17000"&&So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
id="t-20000"&&The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.
id="t-31000"&&It has three different kinds of strings.
id="t-34000"&&The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
id="t-42000"&&The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
id="t-53000"&&And the third string is pretty innovative.
id="t-55000"&&It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
id="t-60000"&&It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
id="t-64000"&&When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog.
id="t-74000"&&So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
id="t-90000"&&Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
id="t-93000"&&So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy. 

id="t-100000"&&The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here.
id="t-111000"&&And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy.
id="t-125000"&&And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
id="t-128000"&&It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
id="t-133000"&&And it's very difficult to tune. 

id="t-137000"&&So without further ado, would you like to hear it? 

id="t-139000"&&(Audience: Yes.)

Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you.
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you.
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you.

id="t-143000"&&CP: Okay.
id="t-145000"&&There I go.
id="t-148000"&&I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain. 

id="t-156000"&&(Music) 

id="t-165000"&&[Basque] 

id="t-156000"&&(Music) 

id="t-261000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-263000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-265000"&&This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
id="t-271000"&&And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. 

id="t-156000"&&(Music) 

id="t-261000"&&Thank you.
id="t-261000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-263000"&&(Applause)
