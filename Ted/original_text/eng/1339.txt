id="t-2000"&&Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.
id="t-4000"&&I started with that sentence about 12 years ago, and I started in the context of developing countries, but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.
id="t-15000"&&So if you think of a map of your country, I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth, you could draw little circles to say, "These are places where good teachers won't go."
id="t-28000"&&On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes.
id="t-33000"&&So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. 

id="t-40000"&&I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
id="t-51000"&&I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
id="t-58000"&&The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was.
id="t-66000"&&I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there.
id="t-71000"&&After this, we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
id="t-76000"&&But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. 

id="t-90000"&&This is the first experiment that we did -- eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student, a six year-old girl, and he was teaching her how to browse.
id="t-101000"&&This boy here in the middle of central India -- this is in a Rajasthan village, where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process, they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
id="t-117000"&&They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time.
id="t-122000"&&In another South Indian village, these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
id="t-131000"&&They downloaded it from Disney.com, or one of these websites, 14 days after putting the computer in their village.
id="t-141000"&&So at the end of it, we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own, irrespective of who or where they were. 

id="t-153000"&&At that point, I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer.
id="t-162000"&&We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India, where I gave a group of children -- they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
id="t-171000"&&I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface, which you now get free with Windows, and asked them to speak into it.
id="t-180000"&&So when they spoke into it, the computer typed out gibberish, so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
id="t-186000"&&So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
id="t-188000"&&Make yourself understood to the computer."
id="t-192000"&&So the children said, "How do we do that."
id="t-194000"&&And I said, "I don't know, actually."
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) And I left.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) Two months later -- and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
id="t-221000"&&In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) So they could do that on their own.
id="t-228000"&&After that, I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. 

id="t-234000"&&I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo, from the late Arthur C. Clarke, who said, "I want to see what's going on."
id="t-241000"&&And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
id="t-244000"&&He said two interesting things, "A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) The second thing he said was that, "If children have interest, then education happens."
id="t-260000"&&And I was doing that in the field, so every time I would watch it and think of him. 

id="t-264000"&&(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely help people, because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them.
id="t-274000"&&And when you've got interest, then you have education. 

id="t-277000"&&Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.
id="t-280000"&&This is a 15 year-old boy. 

id="t-282000"&&(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games like animals, and I listen to music. 

id="t-291000"&&SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
id="t-293000"&&And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
id="t-297000"&&This is in Cambodia, rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game, which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
id="t-307000"&&They would, you know, throw it back at you.
id="t-309000"&&They'd say, "This is very boring."
id="t-311000"&&If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away, then they will show off with each other about what they can do.
id="t-319000"&&This is what these children are doing.
id="t-321000"&&They are trying to multiply, I think.
id="t-324000"&&And all over India, at the end of about two years, children were beginning to Google their homework.
id="t-331000"&&As a result, the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English -- (Laughter) rapid improvement and all sorts of things.
id="t-341000"&&They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) And indeed they had.
id="t-349000"&&I mean, if there's stuff on Google, why would you need to stuff it into your head?
id="t-355000"&&So at the end of the next four years, I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. 

id="t-363000"&&At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India.
id="t-363000"&&At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India.
id="t-363000"&&At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India.
id="t-373000"&&They said, "There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi."
id="t-380000"&&So in 2006, I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle.
id="t-387000"&&I wanted to test the limits of the system.
id="t-391000"&&The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India.
id="t-395000"&&And I set myself and impossible target: can Tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own?
id="t-410000"&&And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero -- I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them -- they get another zero, I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."

id="t-421000"&&I called in 26 children.
id="t-423000"&&They all came in there, and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.
id="t-427000"&&I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.
id="t-430000"&&It's all in English, and I'm going.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) So I left them with it.
id="t-437000"&&I came back after two months, and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
id="t-441000"&&I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
id="t-444000"&&They said, "Yes, we did."
id="t-444000"&&They said, "Yes, we did."
id="t-444000"&&They said, "Yes, we did."
id="t-449000"&&So I said, "Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?"
id="t-455000"&&They said, "We look at it every day."
id="t-449000"&&So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
id="t-460000"&&So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says, literally, "Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease, we've understood nothing else."

id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-474000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-484000"&&It took me three years to publish that.
id="t-486000"&&It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
id="t-489000"&&One of the referees who refereed the paper said, "It's too good to be true," which was not very nice.
id="t-497000"&&Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher.
id="t-501000"&&And then that's her over there.
id="t-511000"&&Remember, they don't study English.
id="t-526000"&&I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
id="t-526000"&&I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
id="t-526000"&&I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
id="t-534000"&&Whatever the expression, it was not very nice. 

id="t-537000"&&So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent, which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
id="t-543000"&&But 30 percent is not a pass.
id="t-546000"&&So I found that they had a friend, a local accountant, a young girl, and they played football with her.
id="t-552000"&&I asked that girl, "Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass?"
id="t-552000"&&I asked that girl, "Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass?"
id="t-552000"&&I asked that girl, "Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass?"
id="t-558000"&&I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
id="t-560000"&&She said, "What's that?"
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-562000"&&I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time.
id="t-574000"&&She did that for two months.
id="t-576000"&&The scores went up to 50, which is what the posh schools of New Delhi, with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. 

id="t-583000"&&So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious.
id="t-595000"&&So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places, I came to the most remote place that I could think of.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead.
id="t-609000"&&In Gateshead, I took 32 children and I started to fine-tune the method.
id="t-615000"&&I made them into groups of four.
id="t-618000"&&I said, "You make your own groups of four.
id="t-620000"&&Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."
id="t-623000"&&Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
id="t-626000"&&"You can exchange groups.
id="t-628000"&&You can walk across to another group, if you don't like your group, etc.
id="t-632000"&&You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing, come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
id="t-638000"&&And I explained to them that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method. 

id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-474000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-652000"&&The children enthusiastically got after me and said, "Now, what do you want us to do?"
id="t-656000"&&I gave them six GCSE questions.
id="t-659000"&&The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes.
id="t-663000"&&The worst, in 45.
id="t-666000"&&They used everything that they knew -- news groups, Google, Wikipedia, Ask Jeeves, etc.
id="t-672000"&&The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
id="t-675000"&&I said, "Well, let's try it.
id="t-677000"&&I'll come back after two months.
id="t-679000"&&We'll give them a paper test -- no computers, no talking to each other, etc."
id="t-683000"&&The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent.
id="t-687000"&&When I did the experiment, when I did the test, after two months, the score was 76 percent.
id="t-695000"&&There was photographic recall inside the children, I suspect because they're discussing with each other.
id="t-702000"&&A single child in front of a single computer will not do that.
id="t-706000"&&I have further results, which are almost unbelievable, of scores which go up with time.
id="t-712000"&&Because their teachers say that after the session is over, the children continue to Google further. 

id="t-719000"&&Here in Britain, I put out a call for British grandmothers, after my Kuppam experiment.
id="t-725000"&&Well, you know, they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.
id="t-729000"&&200 of them volunteered immediately.
id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time, sitting in their homes, one day in a week.
id="t-742000"&&So they did that, and over the last two years, over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype, using what my students call the granny cloud.
id="t-753000"&&The granny cloud sits over there.
id="t-756000"&&I can beam them to whichever school I want to. 

id="t-765000"&&(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.
id="t-767000"&&You say it.
id="t-770000"&&You can't catch me. 

id="t-773000"&&Children: You can't catch me. 

id="t-776000"&&Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man. 

id="t-779000"&&Children: I'm the gingerbread man. 

Teacher: Well done.
Teacher: Well done.

id="t-789000"&&SM: Back at Gateshead, a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes.
id="t-795000"&&You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
id="t-801000"&&Two children watch a TEDTalk.
id="t-803000"&&They wanted to be footballers before.
id="t-805000"&&After watching eight TEDTalks, he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. 

id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-474000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-816000"&&It's pretty simple stuff. 

id="t-818000"&&This is what I'm building now -- they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
id="t-823000"&&The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens, big broadband connections, but in groups.
id="t-831000"&&If they want, they can call the granny cloud.
id="t-834000"&&This is a SOLE in Newcastle.
id="t-836000"&&The mediator is from Pune, India. 

So how far can we go?
So how far can we go?
id="t-841000"&&I went to Turin in May.
id="t-845000"&&I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
id="t-849000"&&I speak only English, they speak only Italian, so we had no way to communicate.
id="t-854000"&&I started writing English questions on the blackboard.
id="t-858000"&&The children looked at it and said, "What?"
id="t-860000"&&I said, "Well, do it."
id="t-862000"&&They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian, went back into Italian Google.
id="t-867000"&&Fifteen minutes later -- next question: where is Calcutta?
id="t-882000"&&This one, they took only 10 minutes.
id="t-889000"&&I tried a really hard one then.
id="t-892000"&&Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
id="t-897000"&&There was silence for a while, then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
id="t-901000"&&It's Pitagora."
id="t-908000"&&And then, in 20 minutes, the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
id="t-914000"&&This sent shivers up my spine.
id="t-917000"&&These are 10 year-olds.
id="t-917000"&&These are 10 year-olds.
id="t-917000"&&These are 10 year-olds.

id="t-198000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-474000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-946000"&&SM: So you know what's happened?
id="t-948000"&&I think we've just stumbled across a self-organizing system.
id="t-952000"&&A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside.
id="t-959000"&&Self-organizing systems also always show emergence, which is that the system starts to do things, which it was never designed for.
id="t-966000"&&Which is why you react the way you do, because it looks impossible.
id="t-971000"&&I think I can make a guess now -- education is self-organizing system, where learning is an emergent phenomenon.
id="t-978000"&&It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally, but I'm going to try.
id="t-982000"&&But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
id="t-985000"&&One billion children, we need 100 million mediators -- there are many more than that on the planet -- 10 million SOLEs, 180 billion dollars and 10 years.
id="t-996000"&&We could change everything. 

id="t-998000"&&Thanks. 

id="t-474000"&&(Applause)
