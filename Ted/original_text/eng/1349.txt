id="t-0"&&I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
id="t-4000"&&The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed, who is an Egyptian-American, who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out.
id="t-11000"&&Before we went out as a tour, he went out solo and did it first.
id="t-15000"&&Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.
id="t-18000"&&And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.
id="t-21000"&&Now, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems, as you know.
id="t-25000"&&Those two countries aren't getting along these days.
id="t-27000"&&So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know, like part of me likes me, part of me hates me.
id="t-33000"&&Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program, the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one.
id="t-38000"&&These are dilemmas I have every day. 

id="t-41000"&&But I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen, which means I have the American passport, which means I can travel.
id="t-48000"&&Because if you only have the Iranian passport, you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms, you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you, when you get your passport, it still says what country you were born in.
id="t-65000"&&So I remember getting my American passport.
id="t-65000"&&So I remember getting my American passport.
id="t-65000"&&So I remember getting my American passport.
id="t-65000"&&So I remember getting my American passport.
id="t-65000"&&So I remember getting my American passport.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "I'm trying to go places."

id="t-76000"&&But what's interesting is, I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport, even though it says, "Born in Iran."
id="t-76000"&&But what's interesting is, I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport, even though it says, "Born in Iran."
id="t-83000"&&Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries, because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either.
id="t-89000"&&And so I was in Kuwait recently, doing a comedy show with some other American comedians.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-93000"&&They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) And he started asking me questions.
id="t-104000"&&He said, "What is your father's name?"
id="t-106000"&&I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."
id="t-109000"&&He goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"
id="t-111000"&&I said, "He passed away a long time ago.
id="t-113000"&&His name was Jabbar."
id="t-113000"&&His name was Jabbar."
id="t-113000"&&His name was Jabbar."
id="t-117000"&&And I started freaking out, because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) Thought the guy was going to come back and be like, "We've been looking for you for 200 years."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Your grandfather has a parking violation.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Your grandfather has a parking violation.
id="t-135000"&&You owe us two billion dollars."

id="t-139000"&&But as you can see, when I talk, I speak with an American accent, which you would think as an Iranian-American actor, I should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.
id="t-148000"&&But a lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, "Oh, you're Iranian.
id="t-148000"&&But a lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, "Oh, you're Iranian.
id="t-154000"&&Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"
id="t-157000"&&"I could say that, but what if I were to say, 'Hello.
id="t-157000"&&"I could say that, but what if I were to say, 'Hello.
id="t-157000"&&"I could say that, but what if I were to say, 'Hello.
id="t-157000"&&"I could say that, but what if I were to say, 'Hello.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) Like I think you're missing the point here.
id="t-172000"&&Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
id="t-172000"&&Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
id="t-172000"&&Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
id="t-172000"&&Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
id="t-172000"&&Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) Because I imagine the director: "Maz, I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him."
id="t-188000"&&"Why would I do that?
id="t-190000"&&If I want the money, why would I kill myself?"
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) Right.
id="t-197000"&&(Applause) "Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Well, then blow yourself up.
id="t-209000"&&Just do it outside, please."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-215000"&&But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
id="t-215000"&&But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
id="t-215000"&&But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
id="t-219000"&&All it takes in one person to mess it up.
id="t-221000"&&Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York, there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.
id="t-227000"&&Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.
id="t-231000"&&And a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building, and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show.
id="t-242000"&&Now I'll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male, when you show up around a lot of these activities, you start feeling guilty at one point.
id="t-242000"&&Now I'll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male, when you show up around a lot of these activities, you start feeling guilty at one point.
id="t-242000"&&Now I'll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male, when you show up around a lot of these activities, you start feeling guilty at one point.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "I didn't get the memo.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "I didn't get the memo.

id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-262000"&&But what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.
id="t-269000"&&And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing.
id="t-275000"&&My question is: why would you take credit for a failed car bombing?
id="t-279000"&&"We just wanted to say we tried."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "And furthermore, it is the thought that counts."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) "And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
id="t-317000"&&That's not one of us."
id="t-319000"&&But I kept watching the news in case they came back, they were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
id="t-319000"&&But I kept watching the news in case they came back, they were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
id="t-319000"&&But I kept watching the news in case they came back, they were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
id="t-319000"&&But I kept watching the news in case they came back, they were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."

id="t-328000"&&But the fact is, I've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world, and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.
id="t-334000"&&I just did a seven-country solo tour.
id="t-336000"&&I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.
id="t-338000"&&I was in Dubai.
id="t-340000"&&And it's great, there's good people everywhere.
id="t-342000"&&And you learn great things about these places.
id="t-344000"&&I encourage people always to go visit these places.
id="t-346000"&&For example, Dubai -- cool place.
id="t-348000"&&They're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.
id="t-351000"&&They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.
id="t-353000"&&It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
id="t-353000"&&It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
id="t-353000"&&It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-358000"&&I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
id="t-367000"&&And what's crazy -- there's a recession going on, even in Dubai, but you wouldn't know by the prices.
id="t-371000"&&Like in the Dubai Mall, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.
id="t-376000"&&It's like a drug deal.
id="t-376000"&&It's like a drug deal.
id="t-376000"&&It's like a drug deal.
id="t-376000"&&It's like a drug deal.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt?
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I bought five grams.

id="t-399000"&&The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East, sometimes in Latin American countries, South American countries -- a lot of times when they build stuff, there's no rules and regulations.
id="t-409000"&&For example, I took my two year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.
id="t-412000"&&And I've taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the United States.
id="t-415000"&&And when you put your two year-old on a slide in the United States, they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.
id="t-424000"&&Not in the Middle East.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm!
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You take a taxi.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You take a taxi.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "You take a taxi.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Try the yogurt.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Try the yogurt.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) "Try the yogurt.

id="t-447000"&&But one of the things I try to do with my stand-up is to break stereotypes.
id="t-450000"&&And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.
id="t-338000"&&I was in Dubai.
id="t-338000"&&I was in Dubai.
id="t-455000"&&And they don't get paid that well.
id="t-457000"&&And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers.
id="t-459000"&&And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well.
id="t-462000"&&I was doing a show, and they said, "We're going to send a driver to pick you up."
id="t-466000"&&So I went down to the lobby, and I saw this Indian guy.
id="t-468000"&&I go, "He's got to be my driver."
id="t-470000"&&Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.
id="t-473000"&&So I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?"
id="t-473000"&&So I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?"
id="t-473000"&&So I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?"
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I go, "I'm sorry.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) I go, "I'm sorry.
id="t-484000"&&He goes, "I thought you were my driver."

id="t-197000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-500000"&&I'll leave you guys with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes, present Middle Easterners in a positive light -- Muslims in a positive light -- and I hope that in the coming years, more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light.
id="t-513000"&&Who knows, maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond, right.
id="t-516000"&&"My name is Bond, Jamal Bond."

id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) 

Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.

id="t-197000"&&(Applause)
