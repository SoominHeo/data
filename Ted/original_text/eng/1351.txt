id="t-1000"&&When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect -- it was called Natal -- I was inspired, and I thought for a moment, maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling, to create a character which seemed alive, which noticed me, that could look me in the eyes and feel real, and sculpt a story about our relationship.
id="t-28000"&&And so a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3.
id="t-36000"&&And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.
id="t-41000"&&And there was a huge row online about, "Hey, this can't be real."
id="t-47000"&&And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. 

id="t-53000"&&Now, this tech incorporates three big elements.
id="t-57000"&&The first is a Kinect camera, which will be out in November, some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults, collecting dust in Microsoft, plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead, mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea: to create a real, living being in a computer.
id="t-88000"&&Now, I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick, but it's a trick that actually works. 

id="t-98000"&&So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now.
id="t-102000"&&This is Dimitri.
id="t-104000"&&Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.
id="t-107000"&&Now, you notice he's sitting.
id="t-109000"&&There are no controllers, no keyboards, or mice, or joysticks, or joypads.
id="t-118000"&&He is just going to use his hand, his body and his voice, just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice. 

id="t-126000"&&So let's move forward.
id="t-128000"&&You're going to meet Milo for the first time.
id="t-132000"&&We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo, we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat, to be honest with you.
id="t-140000"&&He was quite a know-it-all, and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.
id="t-144000"&&So the problem we introduced to him was this: he's just moved house.
id="t-148000"&&He's moved from London to New England, over in America.
id="t-153000"&&His parents are too busy to listen to his problems, and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.
id="t-160000"&&So here he is walking through the grass.
id="t-164000"&&And you're able to interact with his world.
id="t-167000"&&The cool thing is, what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly.
id="t-174000"&&That means no two people's Milos can be the same.
id="t-179000"&&You're actually sculpting a human being here.
id="t-184000"&&So, he's discovering the garden.
id="t-186000"&&You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails.
id="t-192000"&&Very simple at the start.
id="t-194000"&&By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails; if you're a girl, it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. 

id="t-203000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-209000"&&So remember, this is the first time you've met him, and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.
id="t-217000"&&His face, by the way, is fully AI-driven.
id="t-221000"&&We have complete control over his blush responses, the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress.
id="t-229000"&&We actually do something called body matching.
id="t-231000"&&If you're leaning forward, he will try and slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face, because we went out with this strong idea: how can we make you believe that something's real?
id="t-243000"&&Now we've used the hand.
id="t-245000"&&The other thing to use is your body.
id="t-248000"&&Why not just, instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad, why not use your body just to lean on the chair -- again, relaxed?
id="t-258000"&&You can lean back, but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. 

id="t-266000"&&So Dimitri's now going to use -- he's used his hand; he's used his body.
id="t-270000"&&He's now going to use the other thing which is essential, and that's his voice.
id="t-275000"&&Now, the thing about voice is, our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful, isn't it?
id="t-281000"&&It never works.
id="t-283000"&&You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.
id="t-287000"&&So we've tackled that problem, and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second. 

id="t-292000"&&Milo: I could just squish it. 

id="t-294000"&&Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri? 

id="t-296000"&&Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops.
id="t-303000"&&Do you want Milo to squash it?
id="t-305000"&&When you see the microphone, say ... (PM: Squash.)
id="t-305000"&&When you see the microphone, say ... (PM: Squash.)

Dimitri: Go on, Milo.
Dimitri: Go on, Milo.

PM: No.
PM: No.
id="t-314000"&&Now look at his response.
id="t-314000"&&Now look at his response.
id="t-314000"&&Now look at his response.
id="t-319000"&&What we're using there is, we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.
id="t-323000"&&It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.
id="t-326000"&&We've got a database of words which we recognize.
id="t-328000"&&We pick those words out.
id="t-330000"&&We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice, or the user's voice.
id="t-339000"&&Now we need to have a bit more engagement, and again, what we can do is we can look at the body.
id="t-346000"&&And we'll do that in a second. 

id="t-348000"&&Milo: I wonder how deep it is.
id="t-358000"&&Deep. 

PM: Okay.
PM: Okay.
id="t-366000"&&We're actually teaching him.
id="t-368000"&&It's very, very interesting that men, more than women, tend to be more competitive here.
id="t-375000"&&They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws, but then they want to beat Milo, where women, they're more nurturing about this.
id="t-388000"&&Okay, this is skimming stones.
id="t-390000"&&How do you skim stones?
id="t-393000"&&You stand up, and you skim the stone.
id="t-398000"&&It's that simple.
id="t-400000"&&Just recognizing your body, recognizing the body's motions, the tech, understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up.
id="t-409000"&&Again, all of this is done in the way us humans do things, and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. 

id="t-418000"&&Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.
id="t-426000"&&Try hitting the boat. 

Milo: Ahhh.
Milo: Ahhh.

id="t-438000"&&PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.
id="t-438000"&&PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.
id="t-438000"&&PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.

id="t-444000"&&Milo: Okay. 

id="t-447000"&&PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents, giving us time to be alone and to help him out.
id="t-454000"&&Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start -- his parents had asked him to clean up his room.
id="t-459000"&&And we're going to help him with this now.
id="t-461000"&&But this is going to be an introduction, and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.
id="t-466000"&&We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo.
id="t-476000"&&Now, to do that, we needed a set up, like a magician's trick.
id="t-480000"&&And what we did was, we needed to give Milo this big problem. 

id="t-484000"&&So as Dimitri starts tidying up, you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. 

Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor.
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor.

id="t-495000"&&Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new. 

id="t-497000"&&PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet.
id="t-503000"&&We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.
id="t-506000"&&Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.
id="t-510000"&&It's all been too much for him.
id="t-510000"&&It's all been too much for him.
id="t-510000"&&It's all been too much for him.
id="t-515000"&&Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. 

id="t-522000"&&Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. 

Dimitri: Come on, Milo.
Dimitri: Come on, Milo.
id="t-529000"&&They're always getting stressed. 

id="t-533000"&&Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?
id="t-537000"&&We don't know anyone. 

id="t-540000"&&Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
id="t-542000"&&You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.
id="t-547000"&&Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all. 

id="t-553000"&&Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.
id="t-555000"&&You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. 

id="t-562000"&&Milo: It was good skimming stones.
id="t-572000"&&This looks nice.
id="t-575000"&&You cleaned up my room.
id="t-577000"&&Thanks. 

id="t-579000"&&PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you.
id="t-583000"&&And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen, that is a truly wonderful moment.
id="t-589000"&&And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life, and it goes on, and he has, you know, many adventures.
id="t-597000"&&Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.
id="t-600000"&&Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he's got to go to school. 

id="t-604000"&&The cool thing is that we're doing as well: as you interact with him, you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.
id="t-613000"&&His mind is based in a cloud.
id="t-616000"&&That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer.
id="t-622000"&&He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. 

id="t-626000"&&But for me, this is a wonderful opportunity where technology, at last, can be connected with, where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book.
id="t-644000"&&And I love those revolutions, and I love the future that Milo brings. 

id="t-649000"&&Thank you very much indeed. 

id="t-651000"&&(Applause)
