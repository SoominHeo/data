id="t-1596"&&Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new. 

id="t-11613"&&To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation.
id="t-23114"&&Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing. 

id="t-29154"&&Consider Facit.
id="t-31061"&&I'm actually old enough to remember them.
id="t-33489"&&Facit was a fantastic company.
id="t-35999"&&They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.
id="t-42524"&&Everybody used them.
id="t-44798"&&And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?
id="t-49691"&&They continued doing exactly the same.
id="t-52953"&&In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone.
id="t-58649"&&Gone. 

id="t-59824"&&To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators. 

id="t-75802"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-77239"&&Facit did too much exploitation.
id="t-80422"&&But exploration can go wild, too. 

id="t-82900"&&A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.
id="t-88447"&&Let's call them OncoSearch.
id="t-90830"&&The company was brilliant.
id="t-92511"&&They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer.
id="t-100190"&&Every day was about creating something new.
id="t-103744"&&They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect."
id="t-112687"&&The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete.
id="t-121331"&&OncoSearch did too much exploration. 

id="t-125602"&&I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.
id="t-135428"&&The founder of the idea is Jim March.
id="t-138168"&&And to me the power of the idea is its practicality. 

id="t-143168"&&Exploration.
id="t-144847"&&Exploration is about coming up with what's new.
id="t-148772"&&It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations.
id="t-155591"&&It's about changing our frontiers.
id="t-159408"&&Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.
id="t-169210"&&I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.
id="t-177364"&&We all know that exploration is risky.
id="t-180454"&&We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high. 

id="t-186693"&&Exploitation is the opposite.
id="t-188608"&&Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better.
id="t-194344"&&Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.
id="t-197984"&&It's about making good products faster and cheaper.
id="t-202900"&&Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term.
id="t-207595"&&But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term.
id="t-212503"&&And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic.
id="t-224204"&&That's the risk of exploitation. 

id="t-228667"&&So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.
id="t-233427"&&If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.
id="t-237693"&&Small children, they explore all day.
id="t-240880"&&All day it's about exploration.
id="t-243326"&&As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.
id="t-249820"&&The same goes for companies.
id="t-252706"&&Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent. 

id="t-259239"&&And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.
id="t-263410"&&And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.
id="t-267943"&&For example, "How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?"
id="t-274557"&&Or, "How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?"
id="t-283584"&&So, doing one well is difficult.
id="t-286164"&&Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation. 

id="t-293138"&&So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel.
id="t-305570"&&But when they do, the payoffs are huge.
id="t-310337"&&So we have lots of great examples.
id="t-312750"&&We have Nestl√© creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge. 

id="t-327812"&&Why is balancing so difficult?
id="t-330846"&&I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are.
id="t-335975"&&So I'll talk about two, but there are many. 

id="t-339098"&&So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.
id="t-342616"&&We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work.
id="t-349683"&&So instead of staying with it, we create something new.
id="t-352852"&&But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.
id="t-360381"&&OncoSearch was a good example.
id="t-362725"&&A famous example is, of course, Xerox.
id="t-366607"&&But we don't only see this in companies.
id="t-368731"&&We see this in the public sector as well.
id="t-371726"&&We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
id="t-383766"&&But still, we change much more often.
id="t-387090"&&We really don't give them the chance. 

id="t-390424"&&Another trap is the success trap.
id="t-394808"&&Facit fell into the success trap.
id="t-398275"&&They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it.
id="t-402787"&&They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change.
id="t-409187"&&We are like that, too.
id="t-410504"&&When we know something well, it's difficult to change.
id="t-414872"&&Bill Gates has said: "Success is a lousy teacher.
id="t-420040"&&It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail."
id="t-424457"&&That's the challenge with success. 

id="t-427886"&&So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.
id="t-431364"&&And they apply to our companies.
id="t-433570"&&The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.
id="t-437949"&&And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.
id="t-444709"&&Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle.
id="t-455572"&&I see other companies that say, "I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."

id="t-463635"&&Second one: think in multiple time scales.
id="t-466918"&&I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one.
id="t-470461"&&Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.
id="t-480187"&&So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important.
id="t-484490"&&Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.
id="t-494253"&&But companies can't choose.
id="t-495754"&&They need to fund the journey and lead the long term. 

id="t-500746"&&Third: invite talent.
id="t-503974"&&I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.
id="t-511100"&&I think it's a team sport.
id="t-512830"&&I think we need to allow challenging.
id="t-516273"&&I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.
id="t-526264"&&I think that's also what good parenting is about. 

id="t-530858"&&Last one: be skeptical of success.
id="t-534133"&&Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration.
id="t-546754"&&Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, "Remember, you're only human."

id="t-557923"&&So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff.
id="t-565218"&&But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious. 

id="t-568338"&&I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.
id="t-573397"&&First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot?
id="t-587105"&&And what can you do to challenge? 

id="t-591639"&&Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me?
id="t-600814"&&Is that something I should do more of?
id="t-603596"&&In my case, yes. 

id="t-606657"&&So let me leave you with this.
id="t-608692"&&Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance. 

id="t-621392"&&Thank you. 

id="t-622576"&&(Applause)
