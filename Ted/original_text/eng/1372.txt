Why grow homes?
Why grow homes?
id="t-4000"&&Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.
id="t-7000"&&And there's a cause for that, all right.
id="t-9000"&&We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.
id="t-12000"&&As an architect, I have to confront something like this. 

id="t-15000"&&So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses?
id="t-19000"&&Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.
id="t-22000"&&It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together, or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.
id="t-28000"&&And we do something different than what we did in the past; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.
id="t-34000"&&We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter, plants, into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

id="t-34000"&&We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter, plants, into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
id="t-45000"&&It is the landscape, right? 

id="t-47000"&&And you can have a hundred million of these homes, and it's great because they suck carbon.
id="t-51000"&&They're perfect.
id="t-53000"&&You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs, because these are homes that are a part of the environment.
id="t-59000"&&Imagine pre-growing a village -- it takes about seven to 10 years -- and everything is green. 

id="t-66000"&&So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the in-vitro meat habitat, or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. 

id="t-89000"&&So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.
id="t-92000"&&And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs.
id="t-96000"&&We use a modified inkjet printer, and we print geometry.
id="t-100000"&&We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed.
id="t-100000"&&We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed.
id="t-100000"&&We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed.
id="t-111000"&&So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. 

id="t-115000"&&So here is a typical stud wall, an architectural construction, and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house, where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation, cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. 

id="t-130000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-133000"&&And we know it's incredibly ugly.
id="t-135000"&&It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial, but we kind of chose this shape.
id="t-140000"&&And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it. 

id="t-143000"&&We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat.
id="t-143000"&&We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat.
