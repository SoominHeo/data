id="t-43000"&&[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
id="t-58000"&&I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
id="t-65000"&&That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
id="t-73000"&&Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
id="t-94000"&&The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art. 

id="t-103000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-107000"&&But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
id="t-116000"&&I heard the word "carcinoma."
id="t-119000"&&Yes, breast cancer.
id="t-122000"&&As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
id="t-132000"&&Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
id="t-144000"&&That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
id="t-152000"&&As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
id="t-163000"&&I thought I knew what fear was.
id="t-165000"&&That day, I learned what fear was. 

id="t-169000"&&Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
id="t-169000"&&Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
id="t-169000"&&Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
id="t-182000"&&Is this the end of my dance?"
id="t-185000"&&And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."

id="t-197000"&&I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
id="t-213000"&&So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
id="t-226000"&&I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
id="t-233000"&&I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
id="t-236000"&&So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
id="t-241000"&&I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."

id="t-248000"&&I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
id="t-254000"&&But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
id="t-260000"&&I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
id="t-269000"&&And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
id="t-278000"&&But it wasn't easy.
id="t-280000"&&Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
id="t-283000"&&How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
id="t-290000"&&How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
id="t-304000"&&How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
id="t-309000"&&All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
id="t-312000"&&But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have. 

id="t-317000"&&So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
id="t-330000"&&It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
id="t-333000"&&Difficult.
id="t-336000"&&I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
id="t-345000"&&And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind. 

id="t-351000"&&But I needed something else.
id="t-353000"&&I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
id="t-361000"&&The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
id="t-366000"&&Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
id="t-372000"&&Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
id="t-387000"&&Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
id="t-393000"&&Durga, the fearless one.
id="t-395000"&&I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own. 

id="t-401000"&&Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
id="t-415000"&&I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
id="t-421000"&&I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
id="t-430000"&&What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
id="t-438000"&&Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life. 

id="t-443000"&&My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
id="t-443000"&&My story is the power of thought.
id="t-443000"&&My story is the power of choice.
id="t-457000"&&It's the power of focus.
id="t-459000"&&It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
id="t-443000"&&My story is the power of a metaphor.
id="t-472000"&&It's the power of an image.
id="t-474000"&&Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
id="t-479000"&&She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion. 

id="t-485000"&&As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror. 

id="t-508000"&&I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."

id="t-103000"&&(Applause)
