id="t-0"&&Hi there.
id="t-2000"&&I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines and life.
id="t-7000"&&Or, more specifically, what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video.
id="t-15000"&&Some of you may recognize this image.
id="t-17000"&&This is the opening frame of the video that we created.
id="t-20000"&&We'll be showing the video at the end, but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted. 

id="t-27000"&&Now, when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
id="t-38000"&&And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.
id="t-45000"&&They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
id="t-48000"&&50-million-plus views on YouTube.
id="t-50000"&&Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera.
id="t-55000"&&A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
id="t-57000"&&So we were really excited about working with them.
id="t-59000"&&And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
id="t-62000"&&And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. 

id="t-66000"&&Now, for those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.
id="t-79000"&&So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.
id="t-85000"&&And we came up with some parameters, because, you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open. 

id="t-95000"&&And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video.
id="t-100000"&&So we came up with a list of requirements, the "10 commandments," and they were, in order of ascending difficulty: The first is "No magic."
id="t-110000"&&Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer.
id="t-114000"&&The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.
id="t-119000"&&They wanted band integration, that is, the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around.
id="t-126000"&&They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
id="t-129000"&&So as the song picks up emotion, so should the machine get grander in its process.
id="t-135000"&&They wanted us to make use of the space.
id="t-137000"&&So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using, divided between two floors.
id="t-142000"&&It included an exterior loading dock.
id="t-144000"&&We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
id="t-150000"&&They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
id="t-153000"&&The machine itself would start the music.
id="t-155000"&&So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
id="t-165000"&&And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
id="t-168000"&&And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
id="t-208000"&&Okay.
id="t-201000"&&(Laughter) They wanted it to end precisely on time.
id="t-182000"&&Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
id="t-185000"&&And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song.
id="t-194000"&&And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot. 

id="t-201000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-203000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-208000"&&Okay.
id="t-211000"&&So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process.
id="t-215000"&&The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
id="t-219000"&&It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction.
id="t-226000"&&Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.
id="t-232000"&&We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process.
id="t-237000"&&We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
id="t-201000"&&(Laughter) And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
id="t-253000"&&And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
id="t-257000"&&And it's actually in the machine. 

id="t-260000"&&So what did we learn from all of this?
id="t-262000"&&Well, having completed this, we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.
id="t-268000"&&And we learned that small stuff stinks.
id="t-270000"&&Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
id="t-281000"&&And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
id="t-284000"&&It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
id="t-290000"&&But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.
id="t-290000"&&But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.
id="t-290000"&&But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.
id="t-297000"&&Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right? 

What else?
What else?
id="t-201000"&&(Laughter) You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.
id="t-312000"&&It's been said that, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
id="t-316000"&&I think our enemy was physics -- (Laughter) and she's a cruel mistress.
id="t-323000"&&Often, we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
id="t-328000"&&And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
id="t-331000"&&These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.
id="t-335000"&&So also, put reliable stuff last, the stuff that's going to run every time.
id="t-341000"&&Again, small to large is relevant here.
id="t-344000"&&The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video.
id="t-351000"&&The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
id="t-354000"&&The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem.
id="t-358000"&&But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
id="t-362000"&&So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. 

id="t-368000"&&Life can be messy.
id="t-374000"&&There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
id="t-377000"&&Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
id="t-380000"&&And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.
id="t-384000"&&So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad, "This Too Shall Pass."

id="t-389000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-203000"&&(Applause) And now to introduce 

id="t-399000"&&their music video, we have OK Go. 

OK Go: An introduction.

id="t-416000"&&I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.
id="t-418000"&&Let me start again.
id="t-420000"&&We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
id="t-423000"&&Tim's sundial hat.
id="t-425000"&&Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
id="t-427000"&&Sorry, start again.
id="t-429000"&&(Barking) Dogs.
id="t-429000"&&(Barking) Dogs.
id="t-429000"&&(Barking) Dogs.
id="t-438000"&&[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
id="t-438000"&&[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
id="t-438000"&&[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
