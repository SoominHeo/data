id="t-2000"&&Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.
id="t-4000"&&These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like "barrel roll."
id="t-10000"&&It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
id="t-10000"&&It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
id="t-10000"&&It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
id="t-10000"&&It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
id="t-10000"&&It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
id="t-17000"&&I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.
id="t-19000"&&Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream, "4chan!"

id="t-28000"&&Christopher Poole: When I was 15, I found this website called Futaba Channel.
id="t-33000"&&And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.
id="t-37000"&&That format of forum, at that time, was not well-known outside of Japan.
id="t-42000"&&And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English, and I stuck it up for my friends to use.
id="t-48000"&&Now, six and a half years later, over seven million people are using it, contributing over 700,000 posts per day.
id="t-55000"&&And we've gone from one board to 48 boards. 

id="t-60000"&&This is what it looks like.
id="t-62000"&&So, what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous, and it has no memory.
id="t-68000"&&There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.
id="t-71000"&&These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on 4chan.
id="t-75000"&&And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.
id="t-82000"&&What the site's known for, because it has this environment, is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."

id="t-91000"&&Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats -- just silly pictures of cats with text.
id="t-99000"&&And this resonates with millions of people, apparently, because there are tens of thousands of these, and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these.
id="t-108000"&&And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch, really simple, classic bait and switch.
id="t-117000"&&Somebody says they're linking to something interesting, and you get an '80s pop song.
id="t-117000"&&Somebody says they're linking to something interesting, and you get an '80s pop song.
id="t-123000"&&And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls millions of people on television.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-135000"&&There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.
id="t-137000"&&There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream, the ones I've just shown you, but every day, every month, people are producing thousands of these. 

id="t-148000"&&So does a site like this have rules?
id="t-150000"&&We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.
id="t-156000"&&And so they've come up with their own set of rules, the "Rules of the Internet."
id="t-160000"&&And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.
id="t-163000"&&Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.
id="t-166000"&&Two is you do not talk about /b/.
id="t-169000"&&And this one's kind of interesting: "If it exists, there is porn of it.
id="t-169000"&&And this one's kind of interesting: "If it exists, there is porn of it.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) And I will spare you that slide.
id="t-178000"&&I assure you, it is very true. 

id="t-181000"&&/b/ is the first board we started with, and it is, in many ways, the beating heart of the website.
id="t-188000"&&It is where a third of all the traffic is going.
id="t-191000"&&And /b/ is known for, more than anything, not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.
id="t-198000"&&And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago, and that was the Time 100 poll.
id="t-204000"&&So somebody at Time, at the magazine, thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year.
id="t-211000"&&And so they placed me on it, and the Internet got wind of it.
id="t-211000"&&And so they placed me on it, and the Internet got wind of it.
id="t-219000"&&I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.
id="t-222000"&&And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) So they broke that poll.
id="t-230000"&&And I ended up on top.
id="t-232000"&&I ended up at this really fancy party. 

id="t-235000"&&But that's not what's interesting about this.
id="t-238000"&&It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top 21 places to spell "mARBLECAKE.
id="t-238000"&&It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top 21 places to spell "mARBLECAKE.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible.
id="t-259000"&&And "marble cake" is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.
id="t-264000"&&Anonymous is this group of people that protested, very famously, Scientology.
id="t-272000"&&The story is, Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise.
id="t-272000"&&The story is, Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise.
id="t-277000"&&They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
id="t-280000"&&And so these people, over 7,000 people, less than one month later, organized in a hundred cities around the globe and -- this is L.A. -- protested the Church of Scientology, and they have continued to do so, now, two full years after the fact.
id="t-296000"&&They are still protesting.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. 

id="t-310000"&&And last, I'm going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat.
id="t-314000"&&Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.
id="t-317000"&&This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube.
id="t-324000"&&And, you know, this didn't sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this.
id="t-335000"&&So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here -- the Internet detectives came out.
id="t-340000"&&They matched, they found his MySpace.
id="t-343000"&&They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.
id="t-346000"&&Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested. 

id="t-354000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-361000"&&And so, what I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place.
id="t-367000"&&As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.
id="t-369000"&&And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now.
id="t-373000"&&They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking.
id="t-377000"&&We're moving towards persistent identity.
id="t-379000"&&We're moving towards, you know, a lack of privacy, really.
id="t-384000"&&We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so, moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable. 

id="t-390000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-354000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-400000"&&Chris Anderson: Thank you.
id="t-402000"&&Got a couple questions for you.
id="t-404000"&&But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down? 

id="t-407000"&&CP: You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. 

CA: Well, you never know.
CA: Well, you never know.
id="t-416000"&&Don't tell.
id="t-419000"&&But seriously, this issue on anonymity is -- I mean, you made the case there.
id="t-425000"&&But anonymity basically allows people to say anything, all the rules gone.
id="t-430000"&&You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.
id="t-432000"&&And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. 

id="t-441000"&&CP: Yes and no.
id="t-443000"&&I mean, for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment, there is plenty of bad.
id="t-449000"&&There are plenty of downsides.
id="t-451000"&&But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places, now, where you can go and not have identity, to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like.
id="t-463000"&&And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.
id="t-466000"&&Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.
id="t-468000"&&But I think it's important to have these places.
id="t-471000"&&When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place, this outlet, where I can come after work and be myself."

id="t-478000"&&CA: But words, saying things, you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.
id="t-485000"&&And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you, I mean, surely there are huge risks with that. 

id="t-493000"&&CP: There are, certainly.
id="t-495000"&&But -- 

id="t-497000"&&CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board what you might say at TED, right? 

id="t-502000"&&CP: Yeah, I posted a thread on Sunday.
id="t-506000"&&And within 24 hours, it had over 12,000 responses.
id="t-510000"&&And the thing is, I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) 99 percent of it is just, would have been, you know, bleeped out.
id="t-524000"&&But there were some good things that came out of that too.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) Love and peace were mentioned. 

id="t-530000"&&CA: Love and peace were mentioned, kind of with quote marks around them, right? 

id="t-534000"&&CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.
id="t-536000"&&CA: And that content is all off the board now.
id="t-536000"&&CA: And that content is all off the board now.
id="t-536000"&&CA: And that content is all off the board now.

id="t-541000"&&CP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.
id="t-543000"&&It went up to about 16,000 posts, and now it has been taken off. 

id="t-548000"&&CA: Okay, well.
id="t-552000"&&Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
id="t-552000"&&Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
id="t-552000"&&Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
id="t-561000"&&You've got this surprising semi-underground influence, but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.
id="t-570000"&&What's the commercial picture here? 

id="t-573000"&&CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one, I guess.
id="t-577000"&&The site has adult content on it.
id="t-580000"&&I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it, just in terms of language alone.
id="t-584000"&&And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. 

id="t-590000"&&CA: But you still live at home, right? 

id="t-593000"&&CP: I actually moved out recently. 

id="t-595000"&&CA: That's very cool. 

id="t-354000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-599000"&&CP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now. 

id="t-602000"&&CA: But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about 4chan? 

id="t-607000"&&CP: At first, very kind of pained, awkward conversations.
id="t-611000"&&The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.
id="t-615000"&&But my parents -- I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it.
id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) CA: And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. 

CP: Yeah.
CP: Yeah.

id="t-132000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-636000"&&CA: And so, in 10 years' time, what do you picture yourself doing? 

id="t-641000"&&CP: That's a good question.
id="t-643000"&&As I said, I just went back to school, and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning, kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. 

CA: Chris, thank you.
CA: Chris, thank you.
CA: Chris, thank you.
