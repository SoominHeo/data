id="t-6000"&&I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.
id="t-15000"&&And that was largely because there weren't any. 

id="t-18000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-20000"&&So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
id="t-26000"&&A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.
id="t-32000"&&And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G.
id="t-32000"&&And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G.
id="t-46000"&&During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.
id="t-57000"&&So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.
id="t-61000"&&And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
id="t-64000"&&And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.
id="t-70000"&&I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it. 

id="t-74000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-80000"&&It's about Billie Holiday.
id="t-82000"&&And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.
id="t-95000"&&But I know where she was.
id="t-97000"&&She was with me on my lifeboat.
id="t-100000"&&And she was hot. 

id="t-105000"&&(Music)

id="t-200000"&&♫ "This time it's love" ♫ 

id="t-207000"&&♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫ 

id="t-211000"&&♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫
