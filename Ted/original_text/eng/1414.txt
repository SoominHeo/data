id="t-1000"&&If you go on the TED website, you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos, over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings.
id="t-15000"&&And that's a huge amount of data.
id="t-18000"&&And it got me wondering: If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?
id="t-26000"&&Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk?
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) And also, could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with? 

id="t-38000"&&To find this out, I looked at three things: I looked at the topic that you should choose, I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage.
id="t-47000"&&Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose, but you should choose wisely, because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk.
id="t-57000"&&Now, to make this more concrete, let's look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks.
id="t-69000"&&So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains, that's a go.
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Whereas, if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen, girls, aircraft -- actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter) but statistics say it's not so good.
id="t-90000"&&Oh, well.
id="t-92000"&&If you generalize this, the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with, both easily and deeply, such as happiness, our own body, food, emotions.
id="t-105000"&&And the more technical topics, such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men, those are not good topics to talk about. 

id="t-113000"&&How should you deliver your talk?
id="t-115000"&&TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock, so they're going to hate me for revealing this, because, actually, you should talk as long as they will let you.
id="t-144000"&&(Laughter) Because the most favorite TEDTalks are, on average, over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones.
id="t-133000"&&And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.
id="t-133000"&&And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.
id="t-144000"&&(Laughter) But other than that, talk until they drag you off the stage. 

id="t-144000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-146000"&&Now, while ... (Applause) While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.
id="t-157000"&&I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.
id="t-166000"&&I'll give you three examples.
id="t-168000"&&First of all, I must, as a speaker, provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you, instead of saying what I can't have.
id="t-175000"&&Secondly, it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times.
id="t-144000"&&(Laughter) And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news -- to fake intellectual capacity.
id="t-186000"&&If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."
id="t-189000"&&You'll all stay with me.
id="t-191000"&&It's perfectly fine.
id="t-148000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-197000"&&Now, let's go to the visuals.
id="t-199000"&&The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.
id="t-202000"&&And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers, you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average, make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker.
id="t-214000"&&Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.
id="t-217000"&&And now the most important thing, that is the mood onstage.
id="t-221000"&&Color plays a very important role.
id="t-223000"&&Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website.
id="t-148000"&&(Applause) For example, fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color, (Laughter) much more than the average TEDTalk.
id="t-238000"&&Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color, etc., et.
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Now, personally, I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis, but I'll leave this to your good judgment. 

id="t-258000"&&So, now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk.
id="t-262000"&&Now, since this is TEDActive, and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something, I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you, but rather give you a tool to create your own.
id="t-274000"&&And I call this tool the TEDPad.
id="t-144000"&&(Laughter) And the TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected, highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.
id="t-292000"&&You only have to make one decision, and that is: Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks, about creativity, human genius?
id="t-300000"&&Or are you going to go with a black version, which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks, mostly about blogs, politics and stuff?
id="t-308000"&&So, download it and have fun with it. 

id="t-310000"&&Now I hope you enjoy the session.
id="t-313000"&&I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.
id="t-317000"&&And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this, which I really want to see. 

id="t-323000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-148000"&&(Applause) Thanks.
