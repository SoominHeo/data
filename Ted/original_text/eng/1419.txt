id="t-0"&&One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion, and you've turned it into stewardship.
id="t-8000"&&You actually put action to the issues you care about.
id="t-11000"&&But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out.
id="t-17000"&&So, how do you do that? 

id="t-19000"&&One of the things I should probably tell you is, I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career, and that sort of warped my framework.
id="t-26000"&&So, when you start to think about politicians, you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
id="t-32000"&&Other than the fact that they can't tell directions, and they have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) What we need to understand is: What drives the political creature?
id="t-45000"&&And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart: One is reputation and influence.
id="t-50000"&&These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job.
id="t-54000"&&The second one -- unlike most animals, which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self.
id="t-60000"&&Now you may think it's money, but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself. 

id="t-67000"&&Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
id="t-74000"&&So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
id="t-77000"&&You can send them an email.
id="t-79000"&&Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.
id="t-85000"&&It doesn't matter, it's spam.
id="t-87000"&&How about you get on the phone?
id="t-89000"&&Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
id="t-93000"&&That doesn't move.
id="t-95000"&&Face to face would work, but it's hard to set it up.
id="t-99000"&&It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
id="t-102000"&&Yes, contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation, but it takes some time to build up. 

id="t-109000"&&So what actually works?
id="t-111000"&&And the answer is rather strange.
id="t-113000"&&It's a letter.
id="t-115000"&&We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.
id="t-119000"&&Letters actually work.
id="t-121000"&&Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.
id="t-127000"&&I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean.
id="t-134000"&&So, how are you going to write your letter?
id="t-136000"&&First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
id="t-141000"&&I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter) but this is actually critical.
id="t-147000"&&And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter.
id="t-151000"&&It is so novel to see this, that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me.
id="t-157000"&&Second of all, I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
id="t-163000"&&Here's my promise to you: If you are consistent and do this, within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"

id="t-172000"&&Now, I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with.
id="t-177000"&&Now, when you approach these animals, you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
id="t-188000"&&So in paragraph number one, what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this: You appreciate them.
id="t-195000"&&You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else, but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
id="t-199000"&&When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
id="t-201000"&&They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
id="t-201000"&&They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind.
id="t-212000"&&When you do this, don't attack people; you attack tactics.
id="t-218000"&&Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
id="t-220000"&&Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.
id="t-228000"&&Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
id="t-231000"&&"Obviously, you're intelligent.
id="t-233000"&&If you had the right information, you would have done the right thing."
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
id="t-240000"&&You're the safe place to come in to.
id="t-243000"&&So, in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people, "If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) 

Animals do displays.
Animals do displays.
id="t-259000"&&You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
id="t-261000"&&You do a number of things: you're a vice president, you volunteer, you do something else.
id="t-265000"&&Why is is this important?
id="t-267000"&&Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature: that you have influence in a large sphere, and that my preservation depends on you. 

id="t-277000"&&Here is one very quick hack, especially for the feds in the audience.
id="t-281000"&&Here's how you mail your letter.
id="t-283000"&&First of all, you send the original to the district office.
id="t-286000"&&So, you send the copy to the main office.
id="t-289000"&&If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
id="t-292000"&&Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
id="t-297000"&&And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read. 

id="t-302000"&&So, what your letter means: I've got to tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
id="t-322000"&&I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.
id="t-328000"&&This is an opportunity at real dialogue, and if you have stewardship and want to communicate, that dialogue is incredibly powerful.
id="t-337000"&&So when you do that, here's what I can promise: You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest. 

id="t-342000"&&Get writing. 

id="t-344000"&&(Applause)
