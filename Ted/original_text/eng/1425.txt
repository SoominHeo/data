id="t-1000"&&First of all, I'm a geek.
id="t-4000"&&I'm an organic food-eating, carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.
id="t-9000"&&And I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things.
id="t-22000"&&And so I have to figure this out for myself.
id="t-24000"&&For example: Is this evil?
id="t-27000"&&I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
id="t-27000"&&I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
id="t-104000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-40000"&&The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.
id="t-43000"&&This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water, and every time I use a paper towel, I am using this much virtual energy and water.
id="t-53000"&&Wipe it up, throw it away.
id="t-55000"&&Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times, I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel.
id="t-65000"&&This is now operating energy.
id="t-68000"&&So if I throw my towel in the washing machine, I've now put energy and water back into that towel ... unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter) and then it looks a little bit better.
id="t-79000"&&But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets?
id="t-83000"&&Well, now a paper towel looks better.
id="t-83000"&&Well, now a paper towel looks better.
id="t-83000"&&Well, now a paper towel looks better.
id="t-87000"&&I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water, and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.
id="t-92000"&&Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on, and then you start to use more energy.
id="t-98000"&&Or worse, you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel.
id="t-102000"&&And now all bets are off. 

id="t-104000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-106000"&&So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize.
id="t-117000"&&Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house.
id="t-104000"&&(Laughter) That's what my husband and I are doing right now.
id="t-127000"&&And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
id="t-129000"&&And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
id="t-133000"&&And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
id="t-140000"&&Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels. 

id="t-151000"&&We wanted to know how much better we could do.
id="t-154000"&&And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.
id="t-162000"&&So first, we demolish it.
id="t-164000"&&It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart, you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back.
id="t-171000"&&We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent.
id="t-177000"&&And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar.
id="t-181000"&&Now, you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete.
id="t-188000"&&We then put in framing.
id="t-190000"&&And so this is framing -- lumber, composite materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC-certified lumber. 

id="t-202000"&&We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising.
id="t-206000"&&If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there.
id="t-212000"&&Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose.
id="t-217000"&&We then put in plumbing, electrical and HVAC, and insulate.
id="t-223000"&&Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy, and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that.
id="t-234000"&&We also used straw bale infill for our library, which has zero embodied energy.
id="t-240000"&&When it comes time to sheetrock, if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock. 

id="t-247000"&&And then you get to the finishes, the subject of all of those "go green" articles, and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all.
id="t-256000"&&And yet, all the press is focused on that.
id="t-258000"&&Except for flooring.
id="t-260000"&&If you put carpeting in your house, it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house, unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy.
id="t-269000"&&So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. 

id="t-277000"&&But before we pat ourselves too much on the back, we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before.
id="t-288000"&&And so the question is: How could we make that back?
id="t-292000"&&And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward, compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house, we make it back in about six years.
id="t-301000"&&Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient, and in that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even.
id="t-311000"&&Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy, it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house.
id="t-319000"&&So what does this mean?
id="t-321000"&&On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year, it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian.
id="t-332000"&&But my elephant in the living room flies.
id="t-335000"&&Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.
id="t-338000"&&But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog. 

id="t-343000"&&And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are. 

Thank you.
Thank you.
