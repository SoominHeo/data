id="t-1000"&&We are drowning in news.
id="t-4000"&&Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year.
id="t-8000"&&That's just one source. 

id="t-11000"&&My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run?
id="t-16000"&&That's the idea behind The Long News.
id="t-19000"&&It's a project by The Long Now Foundation, which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
id="t-25000"&&And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
id="t-31000"&&And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside. 

To take the top stories from the A.P.
To take the top stories from the A.P.
id="t-43000"&&Or this?
id="t-43000"&&Or this?
id="t-48000"&&Really?
id="t-50000"&&Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
id="t-54000"&&Okay, that was kind of cool.
id="t-56000"&&(Laughter) But the top story of this past year was the economy, and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news. 

id="t-66000"&&So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future?
id="t-71000"&&Well, let's take science.
id="t-74000"&&Someday, little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things.
id="t-78000"&&That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
id="t-80000"&&Some recent stories: nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom; they're sending genes into the brain; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body. 

What about resources?
What about resources?
id="t-95000"&&We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
id="t-98000"&&As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
id="t-101000"&&Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
id="t-105000"&&Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research. 

id="t-110000"&&What about global politics?
id="t-112000"&&The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda, and they may.
id="t-117000"&&They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market, they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter, and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers. 

id="t-129000"&&We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
id="t-132000"&&Some recent discoveries: There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica; there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery -- soon, science may no longer need us, and life may no longer need us either; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
id="t-151000"&&It seems that with or without us, life will go on. 

id="t-155000"&&But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one: water found on the moon.
id="t-160000"&&Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
id="t-163000"&&And if NASA doesn't do it, China might, or somebody in this room might write a big check. 

id="t-168000"&&My point is this: In the long run, some news stories are more important than others.
id="t-174000"&&(Applause)
