id="t-18000"&&If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork. 

What are we going to do about it?

id="t-40000"&&I've been simplifying things for 30 years.

id="t-70000"&&So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.
id="t-78000"&&I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.
id="t-82000"&&This is a real thing.
id="t-84000"&&Now, I went one step further and said, "Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document?

id="t-93000"&&And many people might need help in computation.

id="t-121000"&&And what about terms like "over the limit"?
id="t-126000"&&Perhaps a stealth thing.
id="t-126000"&&Perhaps a stealth thing.

id="t-130000"&&When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk.
id="t-138000"&&Plain English is about changing the content.
id="t-143000"&&And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.
id="t-147000"&&It's a grid, it's a calendar.
id="t-149000"&&At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities.
id="t-153000"&&Received very favorably by business. 

id="t-157000"&&And there is some good news to report today.
id="t-159000"&&Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS.
id="t-163000"&&There are 200 million letters that go out.
id="t-166000"&&Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible.
id="t-173000"&&All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
id="t-177000"&&We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English.
id="t-182000"&&They have been tested in the laboratory.
id="t-184000"&&When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.
id="t-190000"&&And the IRS has introduced the program. 

id="t-192000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-197000"&&There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention.
id="t-202000"&&There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity.
id="t-208000"&&We see all this complexity.
id="t-210000"&&It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority.
id="t-220000"&&There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate.
id="t-224000"&&There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. 

id="t-231000"&&So, how are we going to change the world?
id="t-233000"&&Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.
id="t-238000"&&I thank you. 

id="t-192000"&&(Applause)
