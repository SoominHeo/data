id="t-0"&&Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data, to put your data on the web, on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data, scientific data, community data, whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things, in ways that they never could have imagined. 

id="t-18000"&&So, today I'm back just to show you a few things, to show you, in fact, there is an open data movement afoot, now, around the world.
id="t-30000"&&The cry of "Raw data now!"
id="t-32000"&&which I made people make in the auditorium, was heard around the world.
id="t-36000"&&So, let's roll the video. 

id="t-39000"&&A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up, was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED -- Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government, blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data.
id="t-39000"&&A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up, was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED -- Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government, blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data.
id="t-53000"&&Two days it took the Times Online to make a map, a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. 

id="t-66000"&&Here's more data, traffic survey data, again, put out by the U.K. government, and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards, then a user could just make a map, just by clicking. 

Does this data affect things?
Does this data affect things?
id="t-79000"&&Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
id="t-79000"&&Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
id="t-79000"&&Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
id="t-89000"&&And he got, from other data sources, information to show which houses are occupied by white people.
id="t-96000"&&Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt, between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.
id="t-105000"&&The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.
id="t-108000"&&That's the power of taking one piece of data, another piece of data, putting it together, and showing the result. 

id="t-115000"&&Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.
id="t-117000"&&This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site, Where Does My Money Go.
id="t-121000"&&It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.
id="t-123000"&&You can burrow down by a particular type of spending, or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.
id="t-129000"&&So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. 

id="t-132000"&&Yes, certainly you can do it over here.
id="t-134000"&&Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California.
id="t-139000"&&Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California, you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. 

id="t-147000"&&In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov, and data.gov.uk.
id="t-154000"&&And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red. 

id="t-158000"&&How can you use this stuff?
id="t-160000"&&Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places you can take, from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses, you can make paper, print off a paper which has got very, very specific things about the bus stops, the things specifically near you. 

id="t-176000"&&On a larger scale, this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.
id="t-182000"&&It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at.
id="t-186000"&&The red circles are polling stations, selected by your criteria.
id="t-190000"&&And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors, like the threat level.
id="t-194000"&&So, that was government data. 

id="t-197000"&&I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.
id="t-199000"&&This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.
id="t-201000"&&"Terrace Theater" I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.
id="t-206000"&&I was not the only person editing the open street map.
id="t-209000"&&Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map.
id="t-217000"&&Let's now spin the world during the same year.
id="t-217000"&&Let's now spin the world during the same year.
id="t-217000"&&Let's now spin the world during the same year.
id="t-225000"&&You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
id="t-228000"&&Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be. 

id="t-231000"&&Here focusing in on Haiti.
id="t-233000"&&The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be, not as good as the map of California.
id="t-239000"&&Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license, which allowed the open-source community to use it.
id="t-250000"&&This is January, in time lapse, of people editing ... that's the earthquake.
id="t-254000"&&After the earthquake, immediately, people all over the world, mappers who wanted to help, and could, looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up. 

id="t-263000"&&We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.
id="t-264000"&&The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].
id="t-268000"&&So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.
id="t-277000"&&Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. 

id="t-281000"&&There's the map showing, on the left-hand side, that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.
id="t-288000"&&This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads, damaged buildings, refugee camps -- it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work]. 

id="t-295000"&&So, if you've been involved in that at all, I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing, whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"
id="t-301000"&&or you've been putting government or scientific data online, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much, and we have only just started!
id="t-309000"&&(Applause)
