I'm Jon M. Chu.
I'm Jon M. Chu.
id="t-111000"&&I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets."
id="t-111000"&&I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets."
id="t-111000"&&I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets."
id="t-111000"&&I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets."
id="t-117000"&&During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers -- amazing, the best in the world -- and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind.
id="t-126000"&&I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.
id="t-126000"&&I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.
id="t-126000"&&I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.
id="t-133000"&&They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.
id="t-136000"&&I'd never seen anything like that. 

id="t-138000"&&When I was growing up, my heroes were people like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.
id="t-144000"&&I grew up in a musical family.
id="t-146000"&&(Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.
id="t-150000"&&Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.
id="t-156000"&&Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

id="t-93000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-164000"&&And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.
id="t-171000"&&But after seeing what I've seen, the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.
id="t-175000"&&They're here, getting better and better every day.
id="t-178000"&&And dance has progressed.
id="t-180000"&&It is insane what dance is right now.
id="t-182000"&&Dance has never had a better friend than technology. 

id="t-184000"&&Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit, building on it within days and releasing a new video, while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.
id="t-202000"&&And this is happening every day. 

id="t-204000"&&And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.
id="t-211000"&&Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips, and may not have that opportunity, except for us. 

id="t-218000"&&So, we created the LXD, sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers, a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.
id="t-227000"&&A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it.
id="t-227000"&&A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it.
id="t-227000"&&A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it.
id="t-238000"&&We got Madd Chadd, Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.
id="t-243000"&&Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.
id="t-245000"&&Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD. 

id="t-93000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-248000"&&(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me, I get a lot of different reactions actually.
id="t-254000"&&Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out.
id="t-262000"&&And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. 

id="t-2000"&&(Music) 

id="t-93000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-347000"&&J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it -- I actually visually kind of picture lines, and moving them.
id="t-355000"&&I think of like, Transformers, like how panels open and then they fold, they fold in, and then you close that panel.
id="t-364000"&&And then another thing opens, you close that. 

id="t-2000"&&(Music) 

id="t-93000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-451000"&&Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing.
id="t-457000"&&Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
id="t-459000"&&It's not really a conscious decision, "I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."
id="t-464000"&&It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.
id="t-473000"&&I got my name just because I was so young.
id="t-473000"&&I got my name just because I was so young.
id="t-473000"&&I got my name just because I was so young.
id="t-479000"&&So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid. 

id="t-2000"&&(Music) 

id="t-93000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-541000"&&L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy.
id="t-545000"&&And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
id="t-545000"&&And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
id="t-545000"&&And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
id="t-553000"&&And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
id="t-557000"&&And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it.
id="t-562000"&&You know, you create power, then you tame it.
