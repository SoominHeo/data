id="t-22000"&&When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
id="t-34000"&&The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps. 

id="t-41000"&&But help was coming.
id="t-43000"&&At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
id="t-54000"&&And it took them four days.
id="t-54000"&&And it took them four days.
id="t-54000"&&And it took them four days.

id="t-59000"&&Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally.
id="t-65000"&&People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store. 

id="t-75000"&&Maps matter.

id="t-92000"&&In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

id="t-110000"&&Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now.
id="t-116000"&&So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries.

id="t-131000"&&This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.
id="t-137000"&&This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time. 

id="t-143000"&&This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.
