id="t-0"&&So, 120 years ago, Dr. RÃ¶ntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.
id="t-6000"&&Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch, I'm not sure.
id="t-6000"&&Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch, I'm not sure.
id="t-12000"&&That image was the start of the X-ray technology.
id="t-15000"&&And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.
id="t-18000"&&I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. 

id="t-22000"&&The first shot I ever did was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know, so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
id="t-31000"&&But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
id="t-34000"&&And I do really like this shot, because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers.
id="t-40000"&&It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time. 

id="t-44000"&&Moving on to something a bit larger, this is an X-ray of a bus.
id="t-48000"&&And the bus is full of people.
id="t-48000"&&And the bus is full of people.
id="t-48000"&&And the bus is full of people.
id="t-52000"&&And back in the '60s, they used to teach student radiographers to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I, but on dead people.
id="t-60000"&&So, I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid, because she's very old and fragile.
id="t-67000"&&But everyone on that bus is Frieda.
id="t-69000"&&And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray, which is the sort of machine you have on borders, which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things. 

id="t-78000"&&Fairly obvious what that is.
id="t-81000"&&So, using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.
id="t-88000"&&Technology is moving ahead, and these large cargo scanner X-rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.
id="t-95000"&&Again though, to make it come alive you need, somehow, to add the human element.
id="t-99000"&&And I think the reason this image works, again, is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-104000"&&Quite a difficult brief, make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.
id="t-108000"&&But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.
id="t-113000"&&Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface, I show what's within.
id="t-117000"&&So, the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it, it looks the same.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) We all look the same inside, believe me.
id="t-127000"&&The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.
id="t-131000"&&And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.
id="t-133000"&&I peel back the layers and expose it.
id="t-136000"&&And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it. 

id="t-138000"&&And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.
id="t-141000"&&The design comes from within.
id="t-143000"&&It's not just Topshop, I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.
id="t-147000"&&Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
id="t-147000"&&Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
id="t-147000"&&Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
id="t-156000"&&And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
id="t-161000"&&And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy. 

id="t-173000"&&So, that's an empty parka jacket.
id="t-176000"&&But I quite love the way it's posed.
id="t-178000"&&Nature is my greatest inspiration.
id="t-180000"&&And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture.
id="t-186000"&&If you look at the roof of the Eden Project, or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.
id="t-191000"&&And I'm sure those architects are inspired, as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.
id="t-196000"&&This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond.
id="t-201000"&&An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.
id="t-205000"&&Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.
id="t-207000"&&Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing. 

id="t-210000"&&This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.
id="t-212000"&&And the door to my X-ray room is made of lead and steel.
id="t-218000"&&It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.
id="t-228000"&&So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.
id="t-230000"&&A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
id="t-230000"&&A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
id="t-230000"&&A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
id="t-236000"&&What's interesting really about X-ray really is, if you think about it, is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs, or looking for contraband or whatever.
id="t-245000"&&And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful. 

id="t-250000"&&So, still working with film, I'm afraid.
id="t-252000"&&Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed, apart from these large cargo-scanning machines, hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it, which is show my pictures big.
id="t-264000"&&So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner, which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.
id="t-271000"&&They scan each individual X-ray.
id="t-273000"&&And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.
id="t-276000"&&So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.
id="t-278000"&&Still has the tag in it from me buying it, so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.
id="t-282000"&&But there are four X-ray plates.
id="t-284000"&&You can see them overlapping. 

id="t-286000"&&So, when you move forward from something fairly small, a dress which is this size, onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process, you can see that that is a lot of work.
id="t-296000"&&In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.
id="t-298000"&&There is over 500 separate components.
id="t-301000"&&Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.
id="t-303000"&&And I sent them back an X-ray.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) I kid you not. 

id="t-307000"&&Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.
id="t-309000"&&This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.
id="t-312000"&&One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.
id="t-315000"&&The one on the left is an x-ray.
id="t-317000"&&But this time I had to use a real body.
id="t-319000"&&Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real, to make it look like it was a real athlete.
id="t-323000"&&So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.
id="t-325000"&&And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.
id="t-330000"&&But people do donate their bodies to art and science.
id="t-332000"&&And when they do, I'm in the queue.
id="t-334000"&&So, I like to use them.
id="t-103000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-337000"&&The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.
id="t-342000"&&It makes it more organic, more natural.
id="t-344000"&&It's whatever takes my fancy, really.
id="t-346000"&&It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.
id="t-349000"&&That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
id="t-351000"&&But I just like it in bright orange.
id="t-353000"&&And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks, it sort of adds another level.
id="t-357000"&&It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. 

id="t-361000"&&The most difficult things to X-ray, the most technically challenging things to X-ray are the lightest things, the most delicate things.
id="t-367000"&&To get the detail in a feather, believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays, that's quite a challenge.
id="t-373000"&&I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side. 

id="t-378000"&&Video: (Music) The thing in there is very dangerous.
id="t-399000"&&If you touch that, you could possibly die through radiation poisoning.
id="t-403000"&&In my career I've had two exposures to radiation, which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.
id="t-407000"&&It's cumulative. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) It has human connotations.
id="t-419000"&&The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize, but also it looks like it's a robot, and it comes from a sci-fi genus.
id="t-430000"&&It's a surprise that it has humanity, but also man-made, future, alien associations.
id="t-441000"&&And it's just a bit spooky. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine, which is used on the borders between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.
id="t-409000"&&(Music) The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine, which is used on the borders between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.

id="t-409000"&&(Music) The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine, which is used on the borders between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.
id="t-495000"&&And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.
id="t-498000"&&He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper, got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.
id="t-503000"&&So, these little details help to make it work, make it real. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) The problem with using living people is that to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.
id="t-521000"&&So, to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people.
id="t-527000"&&Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies, to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X-rays of the human body, at different densities. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds, I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.
id="t-561000"&&Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
id="t-565000"&&Look at this monster. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) It's so basic.
id="t-409000"&&(Music) It's so basic.
id="t-582000"&&That's what I really like about it, the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it, and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
id="t-588000"&&It's just happening.
id="t-590000"&&And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.
id="t-593000"&&Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye, the way the leaves form.
id="t-593000"&&Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye, the way the leaves form.
id="t-602000"&&So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
id="t-616000"&&The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs, and the more time it needs.
id="t-620000"&&The lighter the object, the less radiation.
id="t-623000"&&Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.
id="t-626000"&&The longer the exposure goes on for, the more detail you get. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) If you look at this, just the tube, it is quite bright.
id="t-649000"&&But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.
id="t-652000"&&So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.
id="t-656000"&&What I like is how hard the edges are, how sharp.
id="t-660000"&&Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it. 

id="t-409000"&&(Music) I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth, for what it's really made of, how it really works.
id="t-671000"&&But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface, which is things that people are used to seeing. 

id="t-682000"&&And that's the sort of thing I've been doing.
id="t-684000"&&I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future.
id="t-688000"&&This is a commercial application of my most recent work.
id="t-692000"&&And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time, like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.
id="t-699000"&&Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
id="t-699000"&&Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
id="t-699000"&&Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
id="t-704000"&&And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off. 

id="t-707000"&&So, what am I doing in the future?
id="t-709000"&&Well, this year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.
id="t-714000"&&So, I've taken it apart, component by component, months and months and months of work.
id="t-719000"&&And with this image, I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.
id="t-727000"&&So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle, not an easy task, in itself.
id="t-732000"&&And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down, and up against you is a wall.
id="t-736000"&&And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car, you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works. 

id="t-741000"&&And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.
id="t-747000"&&Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
id="t-747000"&&Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
id="t-747000"&&Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
id="t-752000"&&And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.
id="t-755000"&&I'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form.
id="t-761000"&&And this is quite a good way of doing it.
id="t-764000"&&I'm also working now with X-ray video.
id="t-766000"&&So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers, and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.
id="t-766000"&&So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers, and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.
