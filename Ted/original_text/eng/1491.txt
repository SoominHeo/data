id="t-0"&&Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.
id="t-4000"&&We utter about six metaphors a minute.
id="t-8000"&&Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others, how we communicate, learn, discover and invent.
id="t-18000"&&But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. 

id="t-23000"&&Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor.
id="t-40000"&&I am, of course, referring to none other than Elvis Presley.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-47000"&&Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.
id="t-50000"&&It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract -- ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts -- we inevitably resort to metaphor.
id="t-60000"&&In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.
id="t-65000"&&Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.
id="t-68000"&&She is not she, but a buttercup.
id="t-71000"&&And love is not love, but being all shook up. 

id="t-76000"&&In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.
id="t-86000"&&This is the mathematics of metaphor.
id="t-89000"&&And fortunately it's very simple.
id="t-91000"&&X equals Y.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) This formula works wherever metaphor is present. 

id="t-99000"&&Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:" Juliet is the sun.
id="t-107000"&&Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet, a name that belongs to something else, the sun.
id="t-116000"&&But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies too.
id="t-122000"&&We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source, in this case the sun, with what we know about its target, Juliet.
id="t-130000"&&And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like. 

id="t-138000"&&So, how do we make and understand metaphors?
id="t-140000"&&This might look familiar.
id="t-142000"&&The first step is pattern recognition.
id="t-142000"&&The first step is pattern recognition.
id="t-142000"&&The first step is pattern recognition.
id="t-147000"&&Three wayward Pac-Men, and three pointy brackets are actually present.
id="t-152000"&&What we see, however, are two overlapping triangles.
id="t-156000"&&Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns.
id="t-161000"&&Second step, conceptual synesthesia. 

id="t-164000"&&Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well, such as colored hearing.
id="t-173000"&&People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters.
id="t-180000"&&We all have synesthetic abilities.
id="t-182000"&&This is the Bouba/Kiki test.
id="t-185000"&&What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-192000"&&If you are like 98 percent of other people, you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba, and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.
id="t-201000"&&Can we do a quick show of hands?
id="t-203000"&&Does that correspond?
id="t-205000"&&Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.
id="t-209000"&&Why do we do that?
id="t-211000"&&Because we instinctively find, or create, a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba, and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. 

id="t-225000"&&And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.
id="t-229000"&&Silence is sweet.
id="t-231000"&&Neckties are loud.
id="t-233000"&&Sexually attractive people are hot.
id="t-236000"&&Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.
id="t-239000"&&Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia, in which we understand one concept in the context of another. 

id="t-247000"&&Third step is cognitive dissonance.
id="t-249000"&&This is the Stroop test.
id="t-251000"&&What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed.
id="t-258000"&&You can take the test now.
id="t-262000"&&If you're like most people, you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink.
id="t-271000"&&The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer. 

id="t-277000"&&Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.
id="t-279000"&&The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible, the literally false sentences.
id="t-285000"&&They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.
id="t-285000"&&They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.
id="t-285000"&&They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.

id="t-297000"&&One of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."
id="t-300000"&&Now, unless you're a prison guard, the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.
id="t-306000"&&Sadly, it's metaphorically true.
id="t-309000"&&And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false.
id="t-314000"&&Metaphor matters because it's around us every day, all the time.
id="t-314000"&&Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. 

id="t-322000"&&Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.
id="t-326000"&&Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."
id="t-334000"&&Object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things, as in, "The Dow fell like a brick."

id="t-342000"&&Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries, and then predict the next day's price trend.
id="t-349000"&&Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue.
id="t-354000"&&And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal.
id="t-362000"&&If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable.
id="t-371000"&&They may feel confident, say, in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.
id="t-376000"&&That's a hypothetical example of course.
id="t-379000"&&But this is how metaphor misleads. 

id="t-383000"&&Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies.
id="t-389000"&&A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.
id="t-394000"&&And they had to make a decision.
id="t-396000"&&What should they do?
id="t-398000"&&Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?
id="t-401000"&&They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.
id="t-405000"&&Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy: World War II, Vietnam, and the third was historically neutral. 

id="t-415000"&&Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others.
id="t-421000"&&Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor.
id="t-314000"&&Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.
id="t-433000"&&Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery, we compare what we know with what we don't know.
id="t-439000"&&And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former. 

id="t-445000"&&Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.
id="t-449000"&&He famously used thought experiments, which are essentially elaborate analogies, to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.
id="t-457000"&&By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy, metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery. 

id="t-467000"&&Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.
id="t-471000"&&But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it.
id="t-476000"&&Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as "fossil poetry."
id="t-480000"&&But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor.
id="t-485000"&&And these fossils still breathe. 

id="t-488000"&&Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy: "Cogito ergo sum."
id="t-495000"&&That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."
id="t-499000"&&But there is a better translation.
id="t-501000"&&The Latin word "cogito" is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together," and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."
id="t-509000"&&So, the original meaning of "cogito" is to shake together.
id="t-514000"&&And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum" is "I shake things up, therefore I am."
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-523000"&&Metaphor shakes things up, giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.
id="t-530000"&&The mind is a plastic snow dome, the most beautiful, most interesting, and most itself, when, as Elvis put it, it's all shook up.
id="t-540000"&&And metaphor keeps the mind shaking, rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.
id="t-545000"&&Thank you very much.
id="t-547000"&&(Applause)
