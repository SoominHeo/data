id="t-0"&&Actually, I come from Britain, but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.
id="t-6000"&&So, that's home really.
id="t-8000"&&The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here.
id="t-12000"&&Capital, Malé, where I live.
id="t-14000"&&Actually, sitting here today in Mysore, we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example. 

id="t-21000"&&If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.
id="t-24000"&&But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.
id="t-27000"&&And it has been my home these years.
id="t-29000"&&For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs, fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.
id="t-33000"&&I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life.
id="t-37000"&&I study fish, also the bigger things, whales and dolphins. 

This is a blue whale.
This is a blue whale.
This is a blue whale.
id="t-49000"&&And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.
id="t-51000"&&One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region.
id="t-55000"&&In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka, during the northeast monsoon season, you can see blue whales very, very easily.
id="t-62000"&&It's probably the best place in the world to see them. 

id="t-64000"&&Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season, I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean, but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.
id="t-72000"&&I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.
id="t-74000"&&Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon" comes from the word "season."

So, it's just a season.
So, it's just a season.
id="t-83000"&&And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
id="t-85000"&&Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
id="t-90000"&&And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
id="t-92000"&&It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
id="t-92000"&&It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
id="t-92000"&&It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
id="t-98000"&&Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
id="t-100000"&&That's what brings the monsoon rain.
id="t-102000"&&And then in the winter things cool down.
id="t-104000"&&High pressure builds over India.
id="t-106000"&&And the whole system goes into reverse. 

id="t-109000"&&So, the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India, across the Indian Ocean, this way towards Africa.
id="t-116000"&&Keep that in mind.
id="t-118000"&&Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.
id="t-122000"&&I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves, including dragonflies.
id="t-122000"&&I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves, including dragonflies.
id="t-128000"&&This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet. 

id="t-131000"&&And one thing you need to know about dragonflies, one important thing, is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.
id="t-137000"&&They need fresh water to breed.
id="t-139000"&&They lay the eggs into fresh water.
id="t-141000"&&Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
id="t-141000"&&Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
id="t-141000"&&Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
id="t-146000"&&So, they're very important.
id="t-148000"&&They control mosquito larvae, among other things.
id="t-148000"&&They control mosquito larvae, among other things.
id="t-148000"&&They control mosquito larvae, among other things.
id="t-155000"&&And typically, there is a lot of variation, but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle, which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water, lives for 10 or 11 months.
id="t-166000"&&And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.
id="t-169000"&&So it's essentially a freshwater animal.
id="t-171000"&&It really does need fresh water. 

id="t-174000"&&Now, the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one, because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen, when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life, it doesn't go very far.
id="t-174000"&&Now, the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one, because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen, when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life, it doesn't go very far.
id="t-186000"&&A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.
id="t-188000"&&They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.
id="t-191000"&&But this guy is an exception.
id="t-193000"&&And this is called the Globe Skimmer, or Wandering Glider.
id="t-197000"&&And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
id="t-200000"&&It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
id="t-200000"&&It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
id="t-200000"&&It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
id="t-208000"&&But it really hasn't been studied very much. 

id="t-210000"&&It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
id="t-214000"&&If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones, like that red one.
id="t-214000"&&If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones, like that red one.
id="t-220000"&&This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
id="t-220000"&&This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
id="t-220000"&&This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
id="t-226000"&&And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?
id="t-229000"&&But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.
id="t-232000"&&Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.
id="t-235000"&&And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives. 

id="t-240000"&&When I first went to the Maldives, dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water.
id="t-247000"&&Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.
id="t-249000"&&Didn't notice them.
id="t-251000"&&But after some time, after some months, one day as I was going out and about, suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.
id="t-259000"&&Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.
id="t-262000"&&I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.
id="t-262000"&&I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.
id="t-262000"&&I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.

id="t-268000"&&And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year, when it happened again, and then the year after that, and then the year after that.
id="t-275000"&&And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.
id="t-278000"&&But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.
id="t-280000"&&And I asked people about them and yes, they knew, but they didn't know anything, where they came from, or anything.
id="t-286000"&&And again I didn't think too much of it.
id="t-289000"&&But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening. 

id="t-293000"&&Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.
id="t-296000"&&And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there -- so here is home.
id="t-301000"&&So, Maldives, beautiful place.
id="t-303000"&&(Laughter) It's built entirely of coral reefs.
id="t-307000"&&And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.
id="t-309000"&&Average height, about that much above sea level.
id="t-312000"&&So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.
id="t-315000"&&But I'm not going to talk about that.
id="t-317000"&&Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil.
id="t-317000"&&Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil.
id="t-323000"&&So, it stays under the soil.
id="t-325000"&&The trees can put their roots into it.
id="t-327000"&&Humans can dig holes and make a well. 

id="t-329000"&&But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.
id="t-332000"&&There is no surface fresh water.
id="t-334000"&&There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes, nothing like that.
id="t-338000"&&So, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up?
id="t-338000"&&So, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up?
id="t-338000"&&So, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up?
id="t-352000"&&Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here, let me have a show of hands, who of you -- not yet, not yet!

id="t-384000"&&It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.
id="t-390000"&&And I got a bit curious about it. 

id="t-392000"&&In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course.
id="t-392000"&&In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course.
id="t-392000"&&In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course.
id="t-392000"&&In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course.
id="t-399000"&&And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives.
id="t-404000"&&And there is the answer, 21st of October.
id="t-406000"&&Not every year, that's the average date.
id="t-408000"&&So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
id="t-408000"&&So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
id="t-408000"&&So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
id="t-412000"&&But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon, Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
id="t-417000"&&But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
id="t-420000"&&It's going towards India, not from India.
id="t-422000"&&So, are these things, how are these things getting here?
id="t-424000"&&Are they coming from India against the wind?
id="t-426000"&&Seemed a bit unlikely. 

id="t-428000"&&So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.
id="t-430000"&&Maldives is a long archipelago.
id="t-432000"&&It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.
id="t-434000"&&I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.
id="t-436000"&&When do you see the dragonflies appear?
id="t-439000"&&And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.
id="t-441000"&&In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me information for three years, average, 24th of September, so late September.
id="t-447000"&&Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.
id="t-449000"&&Far north of Maldives, a bit later.
id="t-451000"&&Then Malé, then further south.
id="t-453000"&&And then the southernmost Maldives.
id="t-455000"&&It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
id="t-458000"&&But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.
id="t-461000"&&How on Earth are they doing that?
id="t-463000"&&I didn't know. 

id="t-465000"&&The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.
id="t-467000"&&I wanted to know about their seasonality, what time of year, this is when they first arrive, but how long are they around for?
id="t-467000"&&I wanted to know about their seasonality, what time of year, this is when they first arrive, but how long are they around for?
id="t-473000"&&So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.
id="t-476000"&&I had a rigorous scientific transect.
id="t-478000"&&I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Malé.
id="t-482000"&&It's about five kilometers around, counting the dragonflies as I go, trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees. 

id="t-489000"&&And they're here for a very short time, October, November, December.
id="t-489000"&&And they're here for a very short time, October, November, December.
id="t-495000"&&And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
id="t-495000"&&And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
id="t-495000"&&And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
id="t-499000"&&That's not the southwest season.
id="t-501000"&&That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes. 

id="t-505000"&&Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way, and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
id="t-512000"&&And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down, up and down.
id="t-512000"&&And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down, up and down.
id="t-516000"&&What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.
id="t-518000"&&And there is a front between them, and the front moves.
id="t-521000"&&So, if you've got India here, when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
id="t-525000"&&Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
id="t-529000"&&And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle. 

id="t-533000"&&So, as it comes over towards Malé I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.
id="t-538000"&&I can be in the southwest monsoon.
id="t-540000"&&But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.
id="t-542000"&&So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon, but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air.
id="t-542000"&&So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon, but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air.
id="t-551000"&&These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India], two inches long, five centimeters long, flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean, at 2,000 meters up.
id="t-551000"&&These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India], two inches long, five centimeters long, flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean, at 2,000 meters up.

So, I was quite pleased with myself.
So, I was quite pleased with myself.
So, I was quite pleased with myself.
id="t-574000"&&What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom?
id="t-574000"&&What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom?
id="t-574000"&&What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom?
id="t-583000"&&What on Earth are they doing?
id="t-585000"&&Well, to cut a long story short, they're actually flying right across the ocean.
id="t-591000"&&They're making it all the way across to East Africa. 

id="t-594000"&&I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.
id="t-599000"&&I know because we have reports from Seychelles, which fit in as well, down here.
id="t-603000"&&And I know because when you look at the rainfall, these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools.
id="t-614000"&&Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are, the monsoon rains.
id="t-618000"&&The larvae have to develop very quickly.
id="t-618000"&&The larvae have to develop very quickly.
id="t-618000"&&The larvae have to develop very quickly.
id="t-623000"&&They're up, and they're off. 

id="t-625000"&&Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back, the top is rainfall for India.
id="t-625000"&&Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back, the top is rainfall for India.
id="t-625000"&&Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back, the top is rainfall for India.
id="t-632000"&&By September, October, it's drying out.
id="t-632000"&&By September, October, it's drying out.
id="t-632000"&&By September, October, it's drying out.
id="t-636000"&&They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
id="t-636000"&&They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
id="t-636000"&&They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
id="t-645000"&&And then they run out of land.
id="t-645000"&&And then they run out of land.
id="t-645000"&&And then they run out of land.
id="t-645000"&&And then they run out of land.
id="t-645000"&&And then they run out of land.
id="t-660000"&&And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
id="t-660000"&&And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
id="t-660000"&&And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
id="t-660000"&&And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.

id="t-668000"&&What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.
id="t-671000"&&And the dragonflies you can see today outside here, on the campus, are the young of this generation.
id="t-679000"&&They hatched out in India.
id="t-679000"&&They hatched out in India.
id="t-679000"&&They hatched out in India.
id="t-679000"&&They hatched out in India.
id="t-679000"&&They hatched out in India.
id="t-689000"&&The wind will swoosh them out across here.
id="t-691000"&&If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look, nothing there, they'll carry on. 

id="t-696000"&&Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought.
id="t-696000"&&Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought.

id="t-696000"&&Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-713000"&&When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
id="t-725000"&&The rain occurs, these are summer rains.
id="t-727000"&&This is a summer monsoon.
id="t-727000"&&This is a summer monsoon.
id="t-727000"&&This is a summer monsoon.
id="t-732000"&&The sun is overhead, maximum heating, maximum evaporation, maximum clouds, maximum rainfall, maximum opportunities for reproduction. 

id="t-740000"&&Not only that, because you have this convection, you have this rising of the air where it's hot, air is drawn in.
id="t-740000"&&Not only that, because you have this convection, you have this rising of the air where it's hot, air is drawn in.
id="t-740000"&&Not only that, because you have this convection, you have this rising of the air where it's hot, air is drawn in.
id="t-754000"&&So, the little fellow that hatches out here, he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
id="t-761000"&&Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
id="t-761000"&&Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
id="t-761000"&&Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
id="t-769000"&&So, in four generations, one, two, three, four and then back. 

id="t-773000"&&A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.
id="t-776000"&&This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.
id="t-781000"&&16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you, for a two inch long insect.
id="t-781000"&&16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you, for a two inch long insect.
id="t-787000"&&Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.
id="t-792000"&&Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.
id="t-795000"&&It's only half the length of this one.
id="t-797000"&&And this crossing here, of the ocean, is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect.
id="t-806000"&&A quite incredible feat.
id="t-808000"&&And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé, in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on. 

id="t-818000"&&But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.
id="t-820000"&&There is more to the story.
id="t-820000"&&There is more to the story.

id="t-870000"&&They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.
id="t-873000"&&And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.

id="t-908000"&&And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records, all the available records of these birds, put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies.
id="t-916000"&&They make use of exactly the same winds.
id="t-918000"&&They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing.
