id="t-30000"&&Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.
id="t-40000"&&And should they ever come in contact ... well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. 

id="t-46000"&&My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.
id="t-50000"&&Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic.
id="t-60000"&&I want to show you two examples.
id="t-62000"&&The first is 4Shbab.
id="t-64000"&&It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel. 

id="t-68000"&&(Video): Video clips from across the globe.
id="t-71000"&&The USA. 

id="t-73000"&&♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ 

id="t-77000"&&♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫ 

id="t-73000"&&♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ 

id="t-84000"&&♫ Everything will be all right ♫ 

id="t-73000"&&♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ 

id="t-88000"&&The Arab world. 

id="t-91000"&&(Music) 

id="t-105000"&&♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫ 

id="t-118000"&&Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.
id="t-122000"&&Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Haïba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives.
id="t-131000"&&He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.
id="t-137000"&&4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels.
id="t-142000"&&And they look something like this.
id="t-91000"&&(Music) 

That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe.
That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe.
id="t-158000"&&In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.
id="t-161000"&&But it's not about fire and brimstone either.
id="t-164000"&&Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges. 

id="t-172000"&&Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.
id="t-175000"&&And it's called "The 99."
id="t-178000"&&Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.
id="t-181000"&&They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa.
id="t-185000"&&And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.
id="t-185000"&&And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.
id="t-185000"&&And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.
id="t-201000"&&So, for example, there is the character of Noora.
id="t-205000"&&She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone.
id="t-212000"&&Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. 

id="t-218000"&&Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.
id="t-220000"&&It's now a theme park.
id="t-222000"&&There is an animated series in the works.
id="t-224000"&&And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever they find it. 

id="t-236000"&&"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.
id="t-243000"&&We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.
id="t-246000"&&Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
id="t-249000"&&I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. 

id="t-256000"&&Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this.
id="t-262000"&&Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern.
id="t-269000"&&After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: "We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another."
id="t-278000"&&And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed.
id="t-278000"&&And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed.
id="t-284000"&&(Applause)
