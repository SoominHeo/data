id="t-1000"&&I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation, the third-largest organized crime, a $10 billion industry.
id="t-1000"&&I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery. 

id="t-19000"&&I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
id="t-26000"&&Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person.
id="t-33000"&&She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute, so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
id="t-51000"&&By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men. 

id="t-59000"&&Shaheen's background I don't even know.
id="t-62000"&&We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many.
id="t-70000"&&But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body.
id="t-77000"&&And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
id="t-84000"&&We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
id="t-87000"&&All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. 

id="t-93000"&&Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography.
id="t-101000"&&You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
id="t-114000"&&In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery.
id="t-125000"&&But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
id="t-128000"&&They are sold in the name of adoption.
id="t-130000"&&They are sold in the name of organ trade.
id="t-133000"&&They are sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything. 

id="t-139000"&&I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.
id="t-142000"&&And I tell you stories from there.
id="t-144000"&&My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager.
id="t-150000"&&I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
id="t-156000"&&I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it.
id="t-166000"&&Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness.
id="t-171000"&&I never felt like a victim, then or now.
id="t-174000"&&But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today -- is this huge outrageous anger. 

id="t-183000"&&Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim.
id="t-192000"&&And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
id="t-196000"&&We, as a society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim.
id="t-203000"&&Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in. 

id="t-223000"&&Where does their journey begin?
id="t-225000"&&Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor.
id="t-231000"&&You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
id="t-231000"&&You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
id="t-231000"&&You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
id="t-251000"&&I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked. 

id="t-260000"&&These people are deceived, forced.
id="t-264000"&&99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution.
id="t-270000"&&Some pay the price for it.
id="t-273000"&&They're killed; we don't even hear about them.
id="t-277000"&&They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people.
id="t-281000"&&But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture.
id="t-289000"&&Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you.
id="t-296000"&&These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, and use you, throw you. 

id="t-302000"&&Each of the girls that I have rescued -- I have rescued more than 3,200 girls -- each of them tell me one story in common ... (Applause) one story about one man, at least, putting chili powder in her vagina, one man taking a cigarette and burning her, one man whipping her.
id="t-323000"&&We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us.
id="t-329000"&&And we are silent about them. 

id="t-331000"&&We think it is easy money.
id="t-333000"&&We think it is shortcut.
id="t-335000"&&We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
id="t-339000"&&But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
id="t-352000"&&And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her.
id="t-357000"&&And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
id="t-360000"&&She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
id="t-365000"&&And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
id="t-369000"&&And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
id="t-372000"&&It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. 

id="t-375000"&&It's in that context that I work.
id="t-377000"&&It's in that context that I rescue children.
id="t-381000"&&I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
id="t-389000"&&When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin.
id="t-396000"&&Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected.
id="t-404000"&&One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive.
id="t-409000"&&And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain.
id="t-418000"&&And for me, I was my greatest experience.
id="t-422000"&&Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher.
id="t-432000"&&Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. 

id="t-437000"&&You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
id="t-442000"&&She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures.
id="t-449000"&&She earns around 12,000 rupees.
id="t-452000"&&She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder.
id="t-457000"&&Why welding and why not computers?
id="t-462000"&&We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage.
id="t-471000"&&They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves; they've crossed the barrier of it.
id="t-480000"&&And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it. 

id="t-488000"&&We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers.
id="t-496000"&&And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives.
id="t-509000"&&These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons. 

id="t-519000"&&What has been my challenge?
id="t-523000"&&My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
id="t-528000"&&I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
id="t-532000"&&I can't hear from my right ear.
id="t-536000"&&I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue.
id="t-541000"&&My biggest challenge is society.
id="t-545000"&&It's you and me.
id="t-541000"&&My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own. 

id="t-555000"&&A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
id="t-565000"&&When her mother fell sick she said, "Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
id="t-569000"&&Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?"
id="t-574000"&&And there is a long pause.
id="t-576000"&&And then she says, "Not one of our girls."

id="t-580000"&&It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall.
id="t-586000"&&It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything.
id="t-592000"&&But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
id="t-596000"&&It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
id="t-602000"&&It's not nice for our children to study with their children.
id="t-606000"&&There it ends.
id="t-608000"&&That's my biggest challenge. 

id="t-610000"&&If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.
id="t-614000"&&I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
id="t-619000"&&They need your compassion.
id="t-622000"&&They need your empathy.
id="t-624000"&&They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance. 

id="t-630000"&&Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem.
id="t-640000"&&Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem?
id="t-646000"&&And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support.
id="t-654000"&&Can you break your culture of silence?
id="t-657000"&&Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
id="t-657000"&&Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
id="t-657000"&&Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?

id="t-666000"&&I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that.
id="t-672000"&&I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds?
id="t-672000"&&I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds?
id="t-678000"&&Can you just encompass these people too?
id="t-682000"&&Because they are also a part of us.
id="t-685000"&&They are also part of this world.
id="t-687000"&&I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more.
id="t-693000"&&They died of AIDS last year.
id="t-696000"&&I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support.
id="t-710000"&&I'm asking you this because no child, no human being, deserves what these children have gone through.
id="t-717000"&&Thank you.
id="t-310000"&&(Applause)
