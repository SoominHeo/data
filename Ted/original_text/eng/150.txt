id="t-781"&&I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
id="t-10157"&&It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale.
id="t-14638"&&And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff.
id="t-19491"&&And he buys a piece of art that I made.
id="t-22466"&&And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps.
id="t-30822"&&So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world. 

id="t-38647"&&Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired.
id="t-42757"&&As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?"
id="t-49838"&&And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place."
id="t-55575"&&And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"
id="t-58662"&&What do you do?
id="t-60751"&&We've all been there, right?
id="t-63212"&&Do I offer to host this guy?
id="t-65370"&&But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.
id="t-74920"&&That's a small trunk! 

id="t-78062"&&So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."
id="t-84060"&&And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"

id="t-88634"&&That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done?
id="t-96501"&&There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.
id="t-100702"&&What if he's psychotic?"
id="t-103029"&&My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door. 

id="t-112274"&&It turns out he was not psychotic.
id="t-114898"&&We've kept in touch ever since.
id="t-116447"&&And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now. 

id="t-123025"&&This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective.
id="t-129198"&&Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered.
id="t-137606"&&The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me. 

id="t-145185"&&So now it's two years later.
id="t-147172"&&I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.
id="t-154248"&&And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out.
id="t-158890"&&And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity. 

id="t-164749"&&So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.
id="t-182229"&&Ha!"

id="t-184566"&&We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
id="t-188780"&&Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.
id="t-194052"&&But they loved it, and so did we.
id="t-197024"&&I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.
id="t-203618"&&We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other.
id="t-213811"&&Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent? 

id="t-220080"&&The wheels had started to turn.
id="t-222023"&&My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder.
id="t-226930"&&And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business. 

id="t-231956"&&Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.
id="t-246735"&&And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.
id="t-251887"&&It's going to be huge!"

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-255506"&&We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.
id="t-259240"&&It did not.
id="t-262994"&&No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.
id="t-268126"&&Why?
id="t-269629"&&Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger. 

id="t-274038"&&Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design.
id="t-280751"&&In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.
id="t-286881"&&We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met.
id="t-296504"&&Could design make that happen?
id="t-299350"&&Is it possible to design for trust? 

id="t-303801"&&I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve.
id="t-309412"&&I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone.
id="t-313618"&&If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
id="t-318429"&&OK, I need you to take out your phones.
id="t-326773"&&Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone.
id="t-333807"&&Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left. 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-349734"&&That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now -- 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-354270"&&is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.
id="t-358581"&&Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
id="t-363171"&&People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet. 

id="t-369401"&&Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?
id="t-374185"&&Most of us feel really responsible.
id="t-377017"&&That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.
id="t-380842"&&And it's because of this that our company can even exist.
id="t-384619"&&By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone? 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-390600"&&Would you tell Twitter he's running for President? 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-395246"&&(Applause) 

id="t-403719"&&OK, you can hand your phones back now. 

id="t-411589"&&So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.
id="t-420011"&&What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment?
id="t-424362"&&What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
id="t-431685"&&Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-442709"&&Now how would you feel about handing your phone over? 

id="t-447784"&&It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
id="t-452951"&&And we didn't actually get it right the first time.
id="t-455985"&&It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
id="t-459447"&&Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them. 

id="t-467107"&&Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.
id="t-470984"&&We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
id="t-481467"&&The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us.
id="t-488094"&&The more different somebody is, the less we trust them.
id="t-493130"&&Now, that's a natural social bias.
id="t-496532"&&But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews. 

id="t-503398"&&Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes.
id="t-507541"&&But if you've got more than 10, everything changes.
id="t-512467"&&High reputation beats high similarity.
id="t-518299"&&The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases. 

id="t-525247"&&Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure.
id="t-531275"&&This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
id="t-535862"&&If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down.
id="t-542507"&&And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother," 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-547539"&&acceptance rates also go down.
id="t-550372"&&But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place.
id="t-550372"&&But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place.
id="t-556663"&&So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
id="t-561170"&&We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing. 

id="t-569200"&&We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
id="t-579918"&&What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside. 

id="t-587823"&&This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
id="t-591630"&&There's three things happening here.
id="t-594081"&&The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
id="t-598841"&&The second is the efforts of our team.
id="t-601969"&&And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
id="t-607099"&&Now, things have been going pretty well. 

id="t-609500"&&Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.
id="t-613647"&&Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes.
id="t-617984"&&Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
id="t-622355"&&In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone.
id="t-629071"&&I was at the front lines of trust breaking.
id="t-633496"&&And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them.
id="t-639113"&&And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving. 

id="t-648073"&&Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.
id="t-658447"&&Turns out, people are justified in their trust.
id="t-661705"&&And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical. 

id="t-667417"&&We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack.
id="t-672274"&&The host rushed him to the hospital.
id="t-675354"&&They donated their own blood for his operation.
id="t-679342"&&Let me read you his review. 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-689053"&&"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions. 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-696557"&&The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals. 

id="t-253316"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-702036"&&Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you.
id="t-709470"&&They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.
id="t-717268"&&They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.
id="t-720578"&&And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.
id="t-724629"&&Highly recommended!"

id="t-395246"&&(Applause) 

id="t-734342"&&Of course, not every stay is like that.
id="t-737089"&&But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for. 

id="t-743740"&&Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up.
id="t-748783"&&How do sharing and transactions go together?
id="t-752059"&&So let's be clear; it is about commerce.
id="t-755832"&&But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete.
id="t-760576"&&The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.
id="t-765612"&&People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything. 

id="t-771428"&&You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic.
id="t-782932"&&What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences?
id="t-787437"&&What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.
id="t-800416"&&Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant? 

id="t-805082"&&Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.
id="t-810246"&&What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?
id="t-814433"&&What would that look like?
id="t-817673"&&What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?
id="t-821736"&&I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation. 

id="t-829878"&&In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this.
id="t-833590"&&They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents.
id="t-838866"&&They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.
id="t-844918"&&And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups. 

id="t-852960"&&Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs.
id="t-874014"&&Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught. 

id="t-879169"&&We didn't invent anything new.
id="t-881568"&&Hospitality has been around forever.
id="t-886568"&&There's been many other websites like ours.
id="t-890180"&&So, why did ours eventually take off?
id="t-896513"&&Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that.
id="t-907390"&&Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias.
id="t-911998"&&And that's amazing to me.
id="t-914304"&&It blows my mind.
id="t-917184"&&I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by. 

id="t-921990"&&Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.
id="t-928511"&&But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next? 

id="t-940341"&&Thank you. 

id="t-395246"&&(Applause)
