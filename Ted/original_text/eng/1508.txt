id="t-0"&&As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world.
id="t-11000"&&And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case, as progress is simply a word for change, and with change you gain something, but you also lose something. 

id="t-22000"&&And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
id="t-32000"&&And that question is this.
id="t-32000"&&And that question is this.
id="t-32000"&&And that question is this.
id="t-37000"&&If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.
id="t-40000"&&But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone?
id="t-44000"&&How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?
id="t-47000"&&How would you do it? 

id="t-49000"&&Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe.
id="t-56000"&&So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.
id="t-60000"&&But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.
id="t-64000"&&It was the world's first popular computer.
id="t-68000"&&And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.
id="t-72000"&&So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type, the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.
id="t-77000"&&The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.
id="t-80000"&&And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. 

id="t-84000"&&If you were an educated child, you would know how to not only use the astrolabe, you would also know how to make an astrolabe.
id="t-91000"&&And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.
id="t-98000"&&Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.
id="t-105000"&&And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea. 

id="t-110000"&&And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection.
id="t-115000"&&And basically, the concept is, how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.
id="t-125000"&&The idea is actually relatively simple.
id="t-127000"&&Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.
id="t-133000"&&Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole, onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded. 

id="t-140000"&&So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.
id="t-144000"&&The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle.
id="t-149000"&&The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.
id="t-153000"&&And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
id="t-156000"&&Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.
id="t-159000"&&The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly.
id="t-165000"&&There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.
id="t-168000"&&And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate.
id="t-168000"&&And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate.

id="t-175000"&&So how would you use this device?
id="t-180000"&&Well, let me first back up for a moment.
id="t-180000"&&Well, let me first back up for a moment.
id="t-180000"&&Well, let me first back up for a moment.
id="t-191000"&&And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.
id="t-197000"&&And you can see the different components.
id="t-200000"&&This is the mater, the scales on the back.
id="t-200000"&&This is the mater, the scales on the back.
id="t-200000"&&This is the mater, the scales on the back.
id="t-200000"&&This is the mater, the scales on the back.
id="t-204000"&&That's the movable part of the sky.
id="t-207000"&&And in the back you can see a spider web pattern.
id="t-211000"&&And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
id="t-211000"&&And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
id="t-211000"&&And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
id="t-211000"&&And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.

id="t-226000"&&You know, I've always wanted one of these.
id="t-228000"&&For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.
id="t-233000"&&And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device.
id="t-238000"&&And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.
id="t-241000"&&But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.
id="t-251000"&&They are just incredibly expensive. 

id="t-253000"&&But let me show you how to work this device.
id="t-255000"&&So let's go to step one.
id="t-258000"&&First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.
id="t-263000"&&So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
id="t-263000"&&So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
id="t-263000"&&So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
id="t-269000"&&Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.
id="t-272000"&&So, step two, I hold the device up, and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now.
id="t-280000"&&And then I measure its altitude.
id="t-280000"&&And then I measure its altitude.
id="t-280000"&&And then I measure its altitude.
id="t-286000"&&Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.
id="t-286000"&&Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.
id="t-286000"&&Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.
id="t-293000"&&Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back.
id="t-302000"&&Okay, so when that happens everything lines up.
id="t-307000"&&I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky.
id="t-307000"&&I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky.
id="t-312000"&&So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands.
id="t-317000"&&And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here.
id="t-317000"&&And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here.
id="t-317000"&&And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here.
id="t-328000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-329000"&&So, I know what you're thinking: "That's a lot of work, isn't it?
id="t-329000"&&So, I know what you're thinking: "That's a lot of work, isn't it?
id="t-335000"&&as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
id="t-339000"&&But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision.
id="t-346000"&&The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky.
id="t-350000"&&He would know where things would fit in the sky.
id="t-353000"&&He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.
id="t-361000"&&He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
id="t-365000"&&And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. 

id="t-369000"&&So, in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances.
id="t-377000"&&So, affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it.
id="t-383000"&&And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together.
id="t-383000"&&And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together.

id="t-401000"&&In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer. 

id="t-405000"&&On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.
id="t-405000"&&On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.
id="t-405000"&&On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.
id="t-412000"&&It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.
id="t-416000"&&And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.
id="t-419000"&&Astrolabes have an incredible history.
id="t-421000"&&They are over 2,000 years old.
id="t-423000"&&The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C. 

id="t-428000"&&And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.
id="t-428000"&&And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.
id="t-428000"&&And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.
id="t-435000"&&And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art.
id="t-439000"&&There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. 

id="t-445000"&&Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.
id="t-448000"&&So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.
id="t-452000"&&And advancing retes became cultural emblems.
id="t-454000"&&This is one from Oxford.
id="t-457000"&&And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.
id="t-457000"&&And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.
id="t-457000"&&And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.

id="t-467000"&&So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
id="t-467000"&&So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
id="t-467000"&&So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
id="t-467000"&&So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
id="t-481000"&&So, what does the astrolabe inspire?
id="t-484000"&&Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago.
id="t-492000"&&It's just an incredible device. 

id="t-495000"&&Every technology advances.
id="t-497000"&&Every technology is transformed and moved by others.
id="t-500000"&&And what we gain with a new technology, of course, is precision and accuracy.
id="t-504000"&&But what we lose, I think, is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky, a sense of context.
id="t-512000"&&Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. 

id="t-522000"&&So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.
id="t-526000"&&And so, what can you learn from these devices?
id="t-529000"&&Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world.
id="t-534000"&&And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together, and also how we connect to the world.
id="t-542000"&&Thanks very much.
id="t-544000"&&(Applause)
