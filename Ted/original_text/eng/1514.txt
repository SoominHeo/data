id="t-0"&&I started my journey 30 years ago.
id="t-7000"&&And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints, to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use the land.
id="t-20000"&&And to me this was a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. 

id="t-33000"&&And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed.
id="t-41000"&&Because that is what has changed, is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.
id="t-46000"&&And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil.
id="t-50000"&&And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground, refinement.

id="t-60000"&&The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities, our cars, our motorcultures, where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration.
id="t-72000"&&And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end, where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes -- where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up? 

id="t-86000"&&And to me, again, photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world, and find those places.
id="t-93000"&&And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?
id="t-108000"&&It was 23 metric tons for one liter.
id="t-111000"&&So whenever I fill up my gas, I think of that liter, and how much carbon. 

id="t-115000"&&And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.
id="t-123000"&&From the photosynthetic growth, it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year. 

id="t-133000"&&And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society.
id="t-138000"&&Looking at 30 billion per year, we look at our two largest suppliers, Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.
id="t-147000"&&And together they only form about 15 years of supply.
id="t-151000"&&The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves, only gives us about 45 years.
id="t-156000"&&So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil will come upon us. 

id="t-161000"&&So, to me, using photography -- and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents, our ways of thinking, to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal with our energy crisis. 

id="t-178000"&&And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, "We did everything we possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time.
