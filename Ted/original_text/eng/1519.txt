id="t-0"&&I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
id="t-10000"&&And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.
id="t-16000"&&I became one of the working homeless.
id="t-19000"&&I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel.
id="t-28000"&&His death hit me pretty hard.
id="t-30000"&&And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that. 

I've camped my whole life.
I've camped my whole life.
id="t-40000"&&So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things.
id="t-53000"&&One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.
id="t-61000"&&Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it.
id="t-69000"&&Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle. 

id="t-76000"&&At first, living in the van was great.
id="t-76000"&&At first, living in the van was great.
id="t-76000"&&At first, living in the van was great.
id="t-81000"&&And I had time to relax and to grieve.
id="t-85000"&&But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
id="t-85000"&&But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
id="t-85000"&&But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
id="t-94000"&&What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer.
id="t-98000"&&And it became impossible to park anywhere -- (Laughs) -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
id="t-106000"&&The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
id="t-109000"&&The doggy went into doggy day care.
id="t-111000"&&And I sweated.
id="t-113000"&&Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
id="t-119000"&&Or I washed up in public rest rooms. 

id="t-123000"&&Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
id="t-129000"&&Food rotted in the heat.
id="t-132000"&&Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.
id="t-143000"&&I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
id="t-149000"&&And I refused to give them up, so I stayed in the van.
id="t-157000"&&And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet. 

id="t-167000"&&When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing.
id="t-167000"&&When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing.
id="t-172000"&&And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
id="t-177000"&&I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
id="t-183000"&&I didn't always succeed. 

id="t-185000"&&But I felt out of control of my life.
id="t-192000"&&And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.

id="t-209000"&&My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same.
id="t-218000"&&But I had changed somehow.
id="t-220000"&&I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression. 

id="t-223000"&&And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
id="t-223000"&&And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
id="t-223000"&&And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
id="t-229000"&&I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
id="t-233000"&&I just wasn't drunk or high.
id="t-236000"&&And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, "You aren't homeless.
id="t-236000"&&And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, "You aren't homeless.
id="t-245000"&&Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.
id="t-250000"&&Then the professor listened to my story and he said, "You have a job.
id="t-250000"&&Then the professor listened to my story and he said, "You have a job.
id="t-257000"&&The real homeless don't have hope."
id="t-261000"&&A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal.
id="t-261000"&&A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal.

id="t-277000"&&A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V.
id="t-288000"&&An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.

id="t-288000"&&An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
id="t-297000"&&And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press," was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing.
id="t-307000"&&You should too.
id="t-309000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-310000"&&I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
id="t-310000"&&I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?

id="t-323000"&&And I cried.
id="t-325000"&&Because I was a writer.
id="t-328000"&&I was a writer.
id="t-330000"&&Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
id="t-333000"&&I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
id="t-336000"&&And I started writing again.
id="t-339000"&&By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
id="t-339000"&&By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
id="t-339000"&&By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
id="t-345000"&&I was no longer homeless.
id="t-347000"&&And I was no longer invisible. 

id="t-350000"&&Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars.
id="t-355000"&&But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.
id="t-361000"&&So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
id="t-365000"&&But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
id="t-371000"&&The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
id="t-376000"&&And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
id="t-378000"&&I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
id="t-381000"&&But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time.
id="t-394000"&&Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED.
