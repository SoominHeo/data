id="t-1000"&&The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
id="t-1000"&&The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
id="t-1000"&&The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
id="t-7000"&&They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.
id="t-11000"&&And I go on the podium.
id="t-13000"&&You know, this little office of the conductor.
id="t-16000"&&Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle, with a lot of space.
id="t-21000"&&And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture.
id="t-25000"&&Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.
id="t-29000"&&And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
id="t-32000"&&Noise becomes music. 

And this is fantastic.
And this is fantastic.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.
id="t-50000"&&So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony.
id="t-50000"&&So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony.
id="t-57000"&&Let's look at the first video.
id="t-59000"&&I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
id="t-62000"&&And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. 

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

id="t-122000"&&Was that nice?
id="t-124000"&&So that was a sort of a success.
id="t-127000"&&Now, who should we thank for the success?
id="t-130000"&&I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
id="t-138000"&&They don't often even look at the conductor.
id="t-140000"&&Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music.
id="t-145000"&&You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.
id="t-149000"&&This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-156000"&&Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.
id="t-159000"&&You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.
id="t-165000"&&In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition.
id="t-171000"&&But Viennese audiences do not do that.
id="t-173000"&&Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.
id="t-180000"&&You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event. 

But what about the conductor?
But what about the conductor?
id="t-191000"&&Um, he was happy.
id="t-194000"&&And I often show this to senior management.
id="t-197000"&&People get annoyed.
id="t-197000"&&People get annoyed.
id="t-197000"&&People get annoyed.
id="t-197000"&&People get annoyed.
id="t-197000"&&People get annoyed.
id="t-204000"&&And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music.
id="t-212000"&&The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time. 

id="t-218000"&&You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
id="t-218000"&&You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
id="t-218000"&&You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
id="t-225000"&&You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience.
id="t-229000"&&And then you have other stories, unseen.
id="t-232000"&&People who build this wonderful concert hall.
id="t-235000"&&People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.
id="t-240000"&&And all those stories are being heard at the same time.
id="t-243000"&&This is the true experience of a live concert.
id="t-243000"&&This is the true experience of a live concert.
id="t-243000"&&This is the true experience of a live concert.
id="t-248000"&&And not all conductors do just that.
id="t-251000"&&Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.
id="t-253000"&&Riccardo Muti, please. 

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

id="t-292000"&&Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure.
id="t-292000"&&Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure.

id="t-292000"&&Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure.
id="t-306000"&&Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?
id="t-308000"&&You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
id="t-308000"&&You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
id="t-308000"&&You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.

id="t-313000"&&Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫ 

Itay Talgam: Come on, with me.
Itay Talgam: Come on, with me.
id="t-320000"&&So please, wait for the conductor.
id="t-320000"&&So please, wait for the conductor.
id="t-320000"&&So please, wait for the conductor.
id="t-320000"&&So please, wait for the conductor.

id="t-326000"&&Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫ (Laughter) 

id="t-332000"&&Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But ...
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But ...
id="t-339000"&&But -- (Laughter) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
id="t-339000"&&But -- (Laughter) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
id="t-339000"&&But -- (Laughter) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) So, does it work?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) So, does it work?

id="t-370000"&&When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"
id="t-372000"&&He says, "I'm responsible."
id="t-374000"&&Responsible in front of him.
id="t-374000"&&Responsible in front of him.
id="t-374000"&&Responsible in front of him.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) So he says, "If I'm -- (Applause) if I'm responsible for Mozart, this is going to be the only story to be told.
id="t-391000"&&It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."

id="t-395000"&&And you know what happened to Muti?
id="t-397000"&&Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor.
id="t-397000"&&Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor.
id="t-397000"&&Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Why?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Why?
id="t-412000"&&You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
id="t-412000"&&You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
id="t-412000"&&You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
id="t-412000"&&You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) He's a nice guy.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) He's a nice guy.
id="t-424000"&&Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control?
id="t-429000"&&Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss. 

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

id="t-463000"&&I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.
id="t-463000"&&I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.
id="t-463000"&&I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.
id="t-474000"&&The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong.
id="t-474000"&&The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong.
id="t-474000"&&The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong.
id="t-481000"&&It says: Never look at the trombones -- it only encourages them.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-490000"&&So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.
id="t-494000"&&Do not interfere.
id="t-494000"&&Do not interfere.
id="t-494000"&&Do not interfere.
id="t-501000"&&Now, either he is senile, and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.
id="t-506000"&&Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, "Come on guys.
id="t-506000"&&Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, "Come on guys.
id="t-506000"&&Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, "Come on guys.
id="t-506000"&&Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, "Come on guys.
id="t-515000"&&It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation."
id="t-520000"&&Interpretation is the real story of the performer.
id="t-520000"&&Interpretation is the real story of the performer.
id="t-520000"&&Interpretation is the real story of the performer.
id="t-526000"&&Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor.
id="t-526000"&&Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor.

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

What's different?
What's different?
What's different?
id="t-568000"&&Did you see the hands?
id="t-568000"&&Did you see the hands?
id="t-568000"&&Did you see the hands?
id="t-568000"&&Did you see the hands?
id="t-574000"&&Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.
id="t-574000"&&Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.
id="t-574000"&&Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.

id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) 

id="t-585000"&&Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again. 

id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.
id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.
id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.
id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.

id="t-584000"&&Audience: (Claps) (Laughter) 

Itay Talgam: Why not together?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play.
id="t-602000"&&Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it.
id="t-609000"&&This is a German orchestra, yes?
id="t-609000"&&This is a German orchestra, yes?
id="t-609000"&&This is a German orchestra, yes?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Do you understand what this guy wants?"
id="t-621000"&&And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together. 

id="t-628000"&&And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction.
id="t-638000"&&Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra."
id="t-638000"&&Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra."
id="t-638000"&&Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra."
id="t-648000"&&Why are the eyes closed?
id="t-650000"&&There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.
id="t-654000"&&And he cues in a flute player like this.
id="t-654000"&&And he cues in a flute player like this.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-673000"&&Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
id="t-673000"&&Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
id="t-673000"&&Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
id="t-673000"&&Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
id="t-673000"&&Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
id="t-689000"&&So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
id="t-689000"&&So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
id="t-689000"&&So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
id="t-689000"&&So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
id="t-689000"&&So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Yeah.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Yeah.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Yeah.
id="t-763000"&&No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.
id="t-766000"&&When he does this, it's not, "Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor."
id="t-766000"&&When he does this, it's not, "Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor."
id="t-773000"&&He says, "This is the gesture of the music.
id="t-775000"&&I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation."
id="t-781000"&&That is another story. 

id="t-783000"&&But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions?
id="t-783000"&&But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions?
id="t-783000"&&But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions?
id="t-789000"&&You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
id="t-795000"&&That's what he does.
id="t-797000"&&The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
id="t-797000"&&The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
id="t-797000"&&The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.

id="t-803000"&&And that's what makes them into partners.
id="t-806000"&&You have the plan in your head.
id="t-808000"&&You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
id="t-808000"&&You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
id="t-808000"&&You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
id="t-814000"&&And you become a partner building the rollercoaster, yeah, with sound, as you actually take the ride.
id="t-821000"&&This is very exciting for those players.
id="t-824000"&&They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) It is very tiring.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) It is very tiring.
id="t-829000"&&But it's the best music making, like this. 

id="t-833000"&&But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.
id="t-839000"&&You also have to be very professional.
id="t-841000"&&And look again at this Kleiber.
id="t-843000"&&Can we have the next video, quickly?
id="t-845000"&&You'll see what happens when there is a mistake. 

id="t-66000"&&(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.
id="t-868000"&&See, second time for the same player.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) "Wait for me after the concert.
id="t-884000"&&I have a short notice to give you."
id="t-884000"&&I have a short notice to give you."
id="t-884000"&&I have a short notice to give you."
id="t-890000"&&But authority is not enough to make people your partners. 

Let's see the next video, please.
Let's see the next video, please.
id="t-895000"&&You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy.
id="t-900000"&&He's conducting Mozart.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) The whole orchestra is playing.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) Now something else.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) See?
id="t-66000"&&(Music) See?
id="t-927000"&&Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

Another solo now.
Another solo now.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) Look at the eyes.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) Look at the eyes.
id="t-66000"&&(Music) Look at the eyes.
id="t-950000"&&First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
id="t-950000"&&First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
id="t-950000"&&First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
id="t-956000"&&So that's a good thing.
id="t-958000"&&And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way.
id="t-964000"&&When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?
id="t-964000"&&When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?
id="t-964000"&&When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?

id="t-973000"&&Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.
id="t-981000"&&So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that.
id="t-990000"&&And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
id="t-994000"&&So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
id="t-994000"&&So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
id="t-994000"&&So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
id="t-994000"&&So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
id="t-1003000"&&So Kleiber is about process.
id="t-1005000"&&Kleiber is about conditions in the world. 

id="t-1007000"&&But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.
id="t-1011000"&&Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.
id="t-1013000"&&Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning.
id="t-1013000"&&Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning.

id="t-66000"&&(Music) 

id="t-1081000"&&Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?
id="t-1083000"&&Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?
id="t-1093000"&&And you're playing a painful sound.
id="t-1095000"&&And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
id="t-1098000"&&But not in a way that you want to stop.
id="t-1100000"&&It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.
id="t-38000"&&(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.
id="t-1114000"&&Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.
id="t-1114000"&&Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.
id="t-1114000"&&Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.
id="t-1114000"&&Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.
id="t-1120000"&&And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to.
id="t-1120000"&&And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to.
id="t-1120000"&&And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to.

id="t-1130000"&&Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
id="t-1139000"&&And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.
id="t-1144000"&&My friend Peter says, "If you love something, give it away."
id="t-1144000"&&My friend Peter says, "If you love something, give it away."
