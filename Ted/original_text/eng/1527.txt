id="t-0"&&Over the next five minutes, my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
id="t-6000"&&Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental, and much of it is unpleasant.
id="t-6000"&&Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental, and much of it is unpleasant.
id="t-16000"&&Well, this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. 

id="t-21000"&&There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.

id="t-21000"&&There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.
id="t-35000"&&Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time, but also your breathing, your heart rate -- which I just also did -- and your brainwaves. 

id="t-43000"&&It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
id="t-43000"&&It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
id="t-43000"&&It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
id="t-49000"&&Most people find that very soothing, and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human.
id="t-56000"&&There is a deep resonance with being at rest.
id="t-58000"&&We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday. 

id="t-62000"&&The second way in which sound affects you is psychological.
id="t-65000"&&Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state.
id="t-65000"&&Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state.
id="t-74000"&&Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions. 

id="t-77000"&&Natural sound can do that too.
id="t-79000"&&Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.
id="t-79000"&&Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.
id="t-79000"&&Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.
id="t-88000"&&It's when they stop you need to be worried. 

id="t-90000"&&The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.
id="t-93000"&&You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of") ("me you're on the wrong track.")
id="t-93000"&&You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of") ("me you're on the wrong track.")
id="t-93000"&&You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of") ("me you're on the wrong track.")
id="t-93000"&&You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of") ("me you're on the wrong track.")

id="t-100000"&&We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input, which is why noise like this -- (Office noise) -- is extremely damaging for productivity.
id="t-108000"&&If you have to work in an open-plan office like this, your productivity is greatly reduced.
id="t-113000"&&And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.
id="t-116000"&&(Ominous music) You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
id="t-116000"&&(Ominous music) You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
id="t-116000"&&(Ominous music) You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
id="t-129000"&&Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be. 

id="t-132000"&&The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.
id="t-136000"&&With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.
id="t-140000"&&(Techno music inside a car) So, ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour?
id="t-140000"&&(Techno music inside a car) So, ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour?
id="t-146000"&&At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds.
id="t-151000"&&So if I were to play this -- (Jackhammer) -- for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable; for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.
id="t-159000"&&For people who can't get away from noise like that, it's extremely damaging for their health. 

id="t-163000"&&And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.
id="t-166000"&&Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, and even hostile, and it has a dramatic effect on sales.
id="t-172000"&&For those of you who are retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.
id="t-177000"&&They are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around on the door.
id="t-182000"&&We all have done it, leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful. 

id="t-187000"&&I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about.
id="t-196000"&&Or start at the bottom, and say what outcomes do we want, and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.
id="t-202000"&&At last we've got some science we can apply.
id="t-204000"&&And we're in the business of designing soundscapes. 

Just a word on music.
Just a word on music.
Just a word on music.

id="t-228000"&&Now, those are one-second samples of music.
id="t-228000"&&Now, those are one-second samples of music.
id="t-228000"&&Now, those are one-second samples of music.
id="t-235000"&&I hope that's going to change over the next few years. 

id="t-238000"&&Let me just talk about brands for a moment, because some of you run brands.
id="t-238000"&&Let me just talk about brands for a moment, because some of you run brands.
id="t-244000"&&There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.
id="t-244000"&&There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.
id="t-244000"&&There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.
id="t-249000"&&I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.
id="t-251000"&&(Intel ad jingle) You all recognize that one.
id="t-251000"&&(Intel ad jingle) You all recognize that one.
id="t-258000"&&1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.
id="t-262000"&&And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing. 

id="t-265000"&&Just leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses, for commercial sound.
id="t-269000"&&First, make it congruent, pointing in the same direction as your visual communication.
id="t-273000"&&That increases impact by over 1,100 percent.
id="t-276000"&&If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent, you reduce impact by 86 percent.
id="t-282000"&&That's an order of magnitude, up or down.
id="t-284000"&&This is important.
id="t-286000"&&Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
id="t-286000"&&Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
id="t-286000"&&Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
id="t-291000"&&Don't just bombard them with stuff.
id="t-293000"&&And, finally, test and test it again.
id="t-293000"&&And, finally, test and test it again.
id="t-293000"&&And, finally, test and test it again.
id="t-297000"&&It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti: sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens. 

id="t-303000"&&So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.
id="t-305000"&&If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you.
id="t-305000"&&If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you.
id="t-305000"&&If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you.
id="t-311000"&&If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world.
id="t-311000"&&If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world.
id="t-311000"&&If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world.
id="t-321000"&&Thank you for lending me your ears today.
id="t-323000"&&(Applause)
