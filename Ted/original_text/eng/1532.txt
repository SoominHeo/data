id="t-12000"&&When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space.
id="t-18000"&&My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half.
id="t-22000"&&And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines. 

id="t-27000"&&So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own.

id="t-27000"&&So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own.

id="t-46000"&&As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own."
id="t-53000"&&So I did some research.
id="t-55000"&&And I found that there was an historic precedence.
id="t-57000"&&Hemingway had his writing space.
id="t-59000"&&Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
id="t-65000"&&In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave. 

id="t-72000"&&So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.

id="t-72000"&&So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
id="t-83000"&&On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
id="t-86000"&&But on the inside, it's anything but.
id="t-88000"&&And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
id="t-90000"&&It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important. 

id="t-98000"&&I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
id="t-101000"&&This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
id="t-106000"&&And he found the scoreboard in the trash. 

id="t-109000"&&Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
id="t-111000"&&This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir.
id="t-116000"&&The guy did it all himself.
id="t-118000"&&And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside. 

id="t-122000"&&So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
id="t-133000"&&There were definitely hang-out spots.
id="t-135000"&&But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things.
id="t-141000"&&Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding. 

id="t-144000"&&Take this place for example.
id="t-146000"&&On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
id="t-148000"&&This is in Long Island, New York.
id="t-150000"&&The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
id="t-153000"&&On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
id="t-158000"&&The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style.
id="t-165000"&&It has no nails or screws.
id="t-167000"&&All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed. 

Here is another pretty typical scene.
Here is another pretty typical scene.
id="t-173000"&&But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
id="t-179000"&&(Laughter) And so there is a good reason for this.
id="t-182000"&&It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
id="t-184000"&&He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space.
id="t-184000"&&He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space.
id="t-191000"&&And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace. 

id="t-199000"&&So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.
id="t-204000"&&It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
id="t-207000"&&It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
id="t-210000"&&Museum quality. 

id="t-212000"&&So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces.
id="t-216000"&&And they were unexpected and they were surprising.
id="t-218000"&&But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them.
id="t-224000"&&And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did.
id="t-228000"&&And they really loved their professions.
id="t-230000"&&And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
id="t-232000"&&And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were. 

id="t-239000"&&So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
id="t-243000"&&Thank you very much.
id="t-245000"&&(Applause)
