id="t-0"&&Thank you.
id="t-3000"&&Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.
id="t-7000"&&I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.
id="t-12000"&&It was a simple machine that changed my life. 

id="t-16000"&&Before that time, I had never been away from my home in Malawi.
id="t-24000"&&I had never used a computer.
id="t-26000"&&I had never seen an Internet.
id="t-30000"&&On the stage that day, I was so nervous.
id="t-35000"&&My English lost, I wanted to vomit.
id="t-41000"&&(Laughter) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu, white people.
id="t-41000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-54000"&&There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.
id="t-57000"&&But well, I'm feeling good right now.
id="t-60000"&&I would like to share that story today.
id="t-63000"&&We have seven children in my family.
id="t-65000"&&All sisters, excepting me.
id="t-69000"&&This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.
id="t-74000"&&Before I discovered the wonders of science, I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers.
id="t-82000"&&Like everyone else, we grew maize. 

id="t-86000"&&One year our fortune turned very bad.
id="t-91000"&&In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.
id="t-96000"&&Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.
id="t-103000"&&My family ate one meal per day, at night.
id="t-107000"&&Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.
id="t-111000"&&The food passes through our bodies.
id="t-113000"&&We drop down to nothing. 

id="t-117000"&&In Malawi, the secondary school, you have to pay school fees.
id="t-122000"&&Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.
id="t-128000"&&I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields.
id="t-132000"&&It was the future I couldn't accept. 

id="t-136000"&&I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education.
id="t-147000"&&So I went to a library.
id="t-149000"&&I read books, science books, especially physics.
id="t-153000"&&I couldn't read English that well.
id="t-155000"&&I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them. 

id="t-163000"&&Another book put that knowledge in my hands.
id="t-167000"&&It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.
id="t-173000"&&Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger, which we were experiencing by that time.
id="t-182000"&&So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.
id="t-186000"&&But I didn't have materials to use, so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials.
id="t-194000"&&Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy.
id="t-41000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-202000"&&I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes.
id="t-206000"&&Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo, I built my machine.
id="t-215000"&&It was one light at first.
id="t-218000"&&And then four lights, with switches, and even a circuit breaker, modeled after an electric bell.
id="t-230000"&&Another machine pumps water for irrigation. 

id="t-237000"&&Queues of people start lining up at my house (Laughter) to charge their mobile phone.
id="t-244000"&&(Applause) I could not get rid of them.
id="t-41000"&&(Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED.
id="t-262000"&&I had never seen an airplane before.
id="t-264000"&&I had never slept in a hotel.
id="t-267000"&&So, on stage that day in Arusha, my English lost, I said something like, "I tried.
id="t-267000"&&So, on stage that day in Arusha, my English lost, I said something like, "I tried.

id="t-281000"&&So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans, and the poor who are struggling with your dreams.
id="t-293000"&&God bless.
id="t-295000"&&Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.
id="t-299000"&&I say to you, trust yourself and believe.
id="t-304000"&&Whatever happens, don't give up.
id="t-0"&&Thank you.
id="t-244000"&&(Applause)
