♫ Where do we go from here?
♫ Where do we go from here?

♫ How do we carry on?
♫ How do we carry on?

id="t-13000"&&♫ I can't get beyond the questions ♫ 

id="t-20000"&&♫ Clambering for the scraps ♫ ♫ in the shatter of us, collapsed ♫ 

id="t-26000"&&♫ It cuts me with every could have been ♫ 

id="t-34000"&&♫ Pain on pain on play, repeating ♫ 

id="t-38000"&&♫ With the backup, makeshift life in waiting ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ 

♫ What of the wretched hollow?
♫ What of the wretched hollow?
♫ What of the wretched hollow?

♫ Are we just going to wait it out?
♫ Are we just going to wait it out?

id="t-72000"&&♫ There is nothing to see here now ♫ 

id="t-75000"&&♫ Turning the sign around ♫ 

id="t-78000"&&♫ We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice ♫ 

id="t-85000"&&♫ A crumbling cliche case ♫ ♫ crumpled and puffy faced ♫ 

id="t-91000"&&♫ caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles ♫ 

id="t-99000"&&♫ All I want, only one street level miracle ♫ 

id="t-105000"&&♫ I'll be an out and out born again ♫ ♫ from none more cynical ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ that time heals everything ♫ 

♫ But what of the wretched hollow?
♫ But what of the wretched hollow?
♫ But what of the wretched hollow?

♫ Are we just going to wait it out?
♫ Are we just going to wait it out?
♫ Are we just going to wait it out?

id="t-138000"&&♫ We will be long gone by then ♫ 

id="t-141000"&&♫ In lackluster ♫ 

id="t-143000"&&♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫ 

id="t-147000"&&♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ 

id="t-150000"&&♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ 

id="t-154000"&&♫ in the one life that we've got ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Everybody says ♫ 

id="t-54000"&&♫ time heals everything ♫ 

♫ And what of the wretched hollow?
♫ And what of the wretched hollow?

♫ The endless in between?
♫ The endless in between?

♫ Are we just going to wait it out?
♫ Are we just going to wait it out?

♫ Just going to sweat it out?
♫ Just going to sweat it out?

♫ Just going to sweat it out?
♫ Just going to sweat it out?

id="t-204000"&&♫ Wait it out ♫ (Applause)
