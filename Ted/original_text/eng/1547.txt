id="t-0"&&So the question is, what is invisible?
id="t-5000"&&There is more of it than you think, actually.
id="t-5000"&&There is more of it than you think, actually.
id="t-5000"&&There is more of it than you think, actually.

We can see matter.
We can see matter.
id="t-21000"&&As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently: "The marriage suffered a setback in 1965, when the husband was killed by the wife."
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-39000"&&So, we can see the stars and the planets, but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together.
id="t-46000"&&With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.
id="t-49000"&&We can't see into the engine room.
id="t-51000"&&We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.
id="t-54000"&&And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.
id="t-58000"&&In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there.
id="t-64000"&&Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy.
id="t-64000"&&Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy.

id="t-71000"&&So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.
id="t-74000"&&One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you.
id="t-79000"&&And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
id="t-79000"&&And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
id="t-79000"&&And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.

The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P.
The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P.
id="t-89000"&&Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
id="t-99000"&&A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him, had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.
id="t-106000"&&After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-112000"&&"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.
id="t-114000"&&"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness, she turns it to her advantage.
id="t-119000"&&A photo is not enough."
id="t-121000"&&So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.
id="t-124000"&&And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish, "To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
id="t-131000"&&After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him, "Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?
id="t-135000"&&I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-145000"&&I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-149000"&&So, one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand.
id="t-155000"&&Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.
id="t-159000"&&It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.
id="t-163000"&&And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. 

id="t-165000"&&For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.
id="t-173000"&&That's what he thought he was there for.
id="t-175000"&&So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

Consciousness.
Consciousness.
Consciousness.
Consciousness.
id="t-185000"&&Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?
id="t-188000"&&But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
id="t-188000"&&But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
id="t-188000"&&But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.

id="t-195000"&&In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
id="t-206000"&&But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
id="t-213000"&&So that's why we don't think it exists, the Sufi masters working on us. 

id="t-218000"&&In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere.
id="t-218000"&&In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere.
id="t-227000"&&With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-239000"&&The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.
id="t-243000"&&Remind you of anyone?
id="t-243000"&&Remind you of anyone?
id="t-243000"&&Remind you of anyone?
id="t-243000"&&Remind you of anyone?
id="t-243000"&&Remind you of anyone?
id="t-252000"&&I'm an ignostic.
id="t-254000"&&I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists, until somebody properly defines the terms.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-263000"&&Another thing we can't see is the human genome.
id="t-266000"&&And this is increasingly peculiar, because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome, they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.
id="t-277000"&&Geneticists will know this, but every year since, it's been revised downwards.
id="t-281000"&&We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome. 

This is extraordinary.
This is extraordinary.
This is extraordinary.

id="t-298000"&&Two more than people, and the same as a gorilla.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) You can't see these things, but they are very strange.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

The stars by day.
The stars by day.
id="t-312000"&&The universe disappears.
id="t-314000"&&The more light there is, the less you can see. 

id="t-317000"&&Time, nobody can see time.
id="t-317000"&&Time, nobody can see time.
id="t-317000"&&Time, nobody can see time.
id="t-328000"&&It's much easier if it's not really there.
id="t-330000"&&You can't see the future, obviously.
id="t-332000"&&And you can't see the past, except in your memory. 

id="t-335000"&&One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see.

Isn't that extraordinary?
Isn't that extraordinary?
id="t-354000"&&Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. 

id="t-362000"&&Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.
id="t-362000"&&Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.

id="t-378000"&&Taste buds, every 10 days or so.
id="t-378000"&&Taste buds, every 10 days or so.
id="t-384000"&&But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago.
id="t-391000"&&The question is, who, then, are we?

Okay.

id="t-405000"&&Gas, you can't see that.
id="t-405000"&&Gas, you can't see that.
id="t-409000"&&Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
id="t-414000"&&It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual.

id="t-431000"&&There is so many things that -- Light.
id="t-431000"&&There is so many things that -- Light.
id="t-431000"&&There is so many things that -- Light.
id="t-431000"&&There is so many things that -- Light.
id="t-443000"&&But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits.
id="t-447000"&&I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light, not to be able to see darkness. 

id="t-451000"&&Electricity, you can't see that.
id="t-453000"&&Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
id="t-453000"&&Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
id="t-453000"&&Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light when you turn the light on.
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light when you turn the light on.

id="t-478000"&&Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye, and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. 

Radio waves.
Radio waves.
id="t-487000"&&Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887, he called them radio waves because they radiated.
id="t-492000"&&And somebody said to him, "Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?
id="t-497000"&&What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"
id="t-500000"&&And he said, "Well, I've no idea.
id="t-502000"&&But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."
id="t-502000"&&But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."
id="t-502000"&&But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."

id="t-509000"&&Anyway, so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know.
id="t-514000"&&It is incredible how little we know.
id="t-517000"&&Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything."

id="t-523000"&&And I've come to the conclusion -- because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"
id="t-523000"&&And I've come to the conclusion -- because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"

id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.

id="t-542000"&&But the point, what I've got it down to, is there are only two questions really worth asking.
id="t-542000"&&But the point, what I've got it down to, is there are only two questions really worth asking.
id="t-542000"&&But the point, what I've got it down to, is there are only two questions really worth asking.
id="t-552000"&&And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century, one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet. 

id="t-563000"&&The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said, "I don't know why we are here.
id="t-569000"&&But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
id="t-32000"&&(Laughter) 

And secondly and lastly, W.H.
And secondly and lastly, W.H.
