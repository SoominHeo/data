id="t-0"&&I'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations.
id="t-7000"&&One of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature, and trying to find hidden data within nature.
id="t-14000"&&It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere, all around us.
id="t-19000"&&Everything gives out some kind of data, whether it's sound or smell or vibration.
id="t-24000"&&Through my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.
id="t-30000"&&And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics.
id="t-35000"&&Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there. 

id="t-46000"&&So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance, by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni.
id="t-57000"&&He created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. 

id="t-68000"&&Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.
id="t-73000"&&He actually coined the term cymatics.
id="t-76000"&&Then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.
id="t-83000"&&He's kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment.
id="t-87000"&&What we can see here is the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator.
id="t-94000"&&As the frequencies increase, so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.
id="t-99000"&&As you can see with your own eyes.
id="t-104000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-108000"&&So, what excites me about cymatics?
id="t-111000"&&Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.
id="t-114000"&&It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.
id="t-118000"&&Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.
id="t-126000"&&Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here, have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.
id="t-132000"&&And the list of scientific applications is growing every day. 

id="t-135000"&&For example, in oceanography, a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.
id="t-144000"&&And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate.
id="t-149000"&&We can also use cymatics for healing and education.
id="t-151000"&&This is an installation developed with school children, where their hands are tracked.
id="t-151000"&&This is an installation developed with school children, where their hands are tracked.
id="t-160000"&&We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form. 

id="t-163000"&&This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.
id="t-170000"&&So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.
id="t-173000"&&This is Pink Floyd's "Machine" playing in real time through the cymascope.
id="t-183000"&&We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.
id="t-186000"&&And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.
id="t-189000"&&So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.
id="t-193000"&&Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.
id="t-196000"&&And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.
id="t-198000"&&And there is thousands of these. 

id="t-200000"&&So what does this all mean?
id="t-202000"&&Well, there is still a lot to explore in its early days.
id="t-202000"&&Well, there is still a lot to explore in its early days.
id="t-207000"&&But consider for a moment that sound does have form.
id="t-211000"&&We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.
id="t-215000"&&Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.
id="t-219000"&&And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.
id="t-222000"&&And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. 

id="t-229000"&&And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe.
id="t-235000"&&Cymatics is accessible to everybody.
id="t-237000"&&I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion, your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics.
id="t-244000"&&I think collectively we can build a global community.
id="t-247000"&&We can inspire each other.
id="t-249000"&&And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen.
id="t-249000"&&And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen.
id="t-104000"&&(Applause)
