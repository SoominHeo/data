id="t-1000"&&I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. 

id="t-9000"&&I'd like to start with a little experiment.
id="t-13000"&&Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery?
id="t-22000"&&Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
id="t-29000"&&But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. 

id="t-44000"&&The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
id="t-57000"&&They also have an estimate of around a billion.
id="t-61000"&&But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.
id="t-73000"&&And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 

Glasses are not very expensive.
Glasses are not very expensive.
id="t-94000"&&The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.
id="t-107000"&&There are just way too few eye care professionals. 

id="t-110000"&&So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K.
id="t-120000"&&This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
id="t-125000"&&In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. 

How do you do this?
id="t-277000"&&How do you solve this problem?
id="t-137000"&&I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
id="t-143000"&&And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. 

id="t-149000"&&What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
id="t-149000"&&What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
id="t-149000"&&What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
id="t-149000"&&What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
id="t-149000"&&What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
id="t-168000"&&So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there.
id="t-175000"&&I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
id="t-180000"&&Next step in my process.
id="t-183000"&&So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
id="t-188000"&&Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
id="t-194000"&&Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... ...
id="t-194000"&&Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... ...
id="t-194000"&&Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... ...

id="t-216000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-223000"&&Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.
id="t-227000"&&In fact, this technology's been evolving.
id="t-230000"&&I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.
id="t-236000"&&There are about 30,000 in use now.
id="t-236000"&&There are about 30,000 in use now.
id="t-236000"&&There are about 30,000 in use now.

id="t-242000"&&And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
id="t-245000"&&I have a global vision for vision.
id="t-248000"&&And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
id="t-258000"&&To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
id="t-261000"&&The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.
id="t-265000"&&This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
id="t-270000"&&But the cost has to be brought right down.
id="t-272000"&&It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. 

id="t-277000"&&How do you solve this problem?
id="t-279000"&&You start to get into detail.
id="t-281000"&&And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
id="t-281000"&&And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
id="t-281000"&&And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
id="t-290000"&&How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
id="t-294000"&&How do you deal with the industry?
id="t-296000"&&And the answer to that is research. 

id="t-300000"&&What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.
id="t-300000"&&What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.
