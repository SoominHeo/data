id="t-0"&&I love theater.
id="t-3000"&&I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.
id="t-9000"&&I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
id="t-17000"&&The idea that in that room at that moment, everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion, comes together.
id="t-28000"&&At that moment, we transcend space and time together.
id="t-32000"&&Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
id="t-37000"&&And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.
id="t-40000"&&Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.
id="t-46000"&&I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show, and began developing "Upwake."
id="t-54000"&&"Upwake" tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
id="t-65000"&&I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.
id="t-69000"&&And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
id="t-72000"&&So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. 

id="t-80000"&&If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside.
id="t-89000"&&Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
id="t-92000"&&This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life.
id="t-99000"&&In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.
id="t-113000"&&I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
id="t-117000"&&Go from one world to another in a second.
id="t-120000"&&I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas.
id="t-127000"&&At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.
id="t-133000"&&Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition, live, on stage. 

id="t-140000"&&So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.
id="t-147000"&&Let's start with technology.
id="t-150000"&&(Fuse blowing) All right.
id="t-150000"&&(Fuse blowing) All right.
id="t-157000"&&(Laughter) (Buzzing) (Click, click, bang) (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. 

id="t-340000"&&"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.
id="t-344000"&&I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with.
id="t-351000"&&The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
id="t-354000"&&I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.
id="t-359000"&&There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.
id="t-362000"&&It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
id="t-367000"&&Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later, what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists.
id="t-378000"&&And here are some excerpts.
id="t-332000"&&(Applause) Thank you. 

id="t-551000"&&So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.
id="t-554000"&&And in Austin, Texas, I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.
id="t-559000"&&When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this: Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.
id="t-567000"&&I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.
id="t-572000"&&But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.
id="t-577000"&&And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another.
id="t-585000"&&Something happened along the way.
id="t-587000"&&Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.
id="t-590000"&&Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
id="t-594000"&&Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century, and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could. 

id="t-603000"&&It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.
id="t-612000"&&As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.
id="t-615000"&&And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
id="t-624000"&&It's as though you made something resonate within them.
id="t-627000"&&It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more.
id="t-634000"&&Because through your mask, they let theirs go. 

id="t-637000"&&Being human is an art form.
id="t-640000"&&I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal.
id="t-644000"&&I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
id="t-647000"&&I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.
id="t-653000"&&I know theater unites us.
id="t-656000"&&Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow, tell various stories through different mediums. 

Comic books.
Comic books.
id="t-667000"&&And Zero wants to go to the moon.
id="t-669000"&&In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.

id="t-732000"&&There is a revolution.
id="t-735000"&&It's a human and technological revolution.
id="t-738000"&&It's motion and emotion.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-740000"&&It's information.
id="t-748000"&&It's happening.
id="t-750000"&&The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
id="t-757000"&&There is a revolution in the way that we think, in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories, our evolution.
id="t-767000"&&This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.
id="t-773000"&&Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
id="t-785000"&&He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.
id="t-790000"&&He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most. 

id="t-799000"&&We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.
id="t-805000"&&In the science of today, we become artists.
id="t-808000"&&In the art of today, we become scientists.
id="t-808000"&&In the art of today, we become scientists.
id="t-808000"&&In the art of today, we become scientists.
id="t-816000"&&We teach, touch and move.
id="t-821000"&&It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work.
id="t-821000"&&It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work.
id="t-831000"&&(Ringing) Thank you.
