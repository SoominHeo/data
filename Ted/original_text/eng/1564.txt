id="t-0"&&Good morning everybody.
id="t-2000"&&I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
id="t-4000"&&The first thing is water.
id="t-6000"&&Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference, over the past couple of days.
id="t-12000"&&And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. 

id="t-16000"&&But what if it wasn't?
id="t-18000"&&What if it was from a source like this?
id="t-23000"&&Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea.
id="t-31000"&&I talked a lot in the past about statistics, and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
id="t-38000"&&But they just don't seem to get through.
id="t-41000"&&And I think I've worked out why.
id="t-43000"&&It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
id="t-52000"&&So we just switch off: us, governments and aid agencies.
id="t-59000"&&Well, today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved.
id="t-68000"&&By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea.
id="t-76000"&&And four children have just died. 

id="t-81000"&&I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry.
id="t-85000"&&I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004, when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in, playing out on TV.
id="t-96000"&&The days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death.
id="t-106000"&&That really stuck with me.
id="t-108000"&&Then, a few months later, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
id="t-115000"&&"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
id="t-119000"&&Day one: nothing.
id="t-122000"&&Day two: nothing.
id="t-125000"&&Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
id="t-130000"&&People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water.
id="t-136000"&&That's when I decided I had to do something. 

id="t-140000"&&Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months, and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle. 

id="t-156000"&&Okay, now for the science bit.
id="t-158000"&&Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
id="t-164000"&&The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
id="t-168000"&&So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
id="t-174000"&&The smallest virus, on the other hand, is about 25 nanometers.
id="t-179000"&&So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
id="t-184000"&&Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
id="t-189000"&&So nothing is getting through. 

id="t-192000"&&Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
id="t-194000"&&Would you like to see that?
id="t-196000"&&I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
id="t-198000"&&We're in the fine city of Oxford.
id="t-201000"&&So -- someone's done that up.
id="t-203000"&&Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here.
id="t-203000"&&Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here.
id="t-211000"&&But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
id="t-219000"&&So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
id="t-221000"&&And this is from my pond. 

id="t-223000"&&(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman. 

Okay.
Okay.
id="t-231000"&&We're just going to pour that in there. 

id="t-234000"&&Audience: Ugh! 

id="t-346000"&&Michael Pritchard: Okay.
id="t-346000"&&Michael Pritchard: Okay.
id="t-241000"&&So I'm just going to put that in there.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Put that in there.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Put that in there.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
id="t-253000"&&And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
id="t-257000"&&So we're just going to put that in there as well.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Okay.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Now. 

id="t-266000"&&The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
id="t-271000"&&You just scoop the water up.
id="t-273000"&&Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all.
id="t-273000"&&Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all.
id="t-273000"&&Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all.
id="t-273000"&&Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all.
id="t-285000"&&Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here.
id="t-285000"&&Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Okay.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) Okay.
id="t-299000"&&Replace the top.
id="t-299000"&&Replace the top.
id="t-299000"&&Replace the top.
id="t-308000"&&That's all that's necessary.
id="t-311000"&&Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
id="t-311000"&&Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
id="t-311000"&&Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
id="t-311000"&&Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
id="t-311000"&&Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
id="t-324000"&&That is safe, sterile drinking water.
id="t-328000"&&(Applause) Cheers.
id="t-328000"&&(Applause) There you go Chris.
id="t-328000"&&(Applause) What's it taste of? 

id="t-344000"&&Chris Anderson: Delicious. 

id="t-346000"&&Michael Pritchard: Okay.
id="t-346000"&&Michael Pritchard: Okay.
id="t-346000"&&Michael Pritchard: Okay.
id="t-244000"&&(Laughter) 

Okay.
Okay.
id="t-360000"&&It'll last for 6,000 liters.
id="t-362000"&&And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
id="t-362000"&&And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
id="t-362000"&&And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
id="t-370000"&&It's good for another 6,000 liters. 

id="t-374000"&&So let's look at the applications.
id="t-376000"&&Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
id="t-378000"&&We ship water.
id="t-380000"&&Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
id="t-384000"&&And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
id="t-389000"&&What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
id="t-389000"&&What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
id="t-389000"&&What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
id="t-397000"&&The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
id="t-401000"&&But by thinking differently, and shipping these, people can stay put.
id="t-407000"&&They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. 

id="t-415000"&&Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work.
id="t-421000"&&Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure and pipe work, is too expensive.
id="t-428000"&&When you run the numbers on a calculator, you run out of noughts.
id="t-432000"&&So here is the "thinking different" bit. 

id="t-435000"&&Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature.
id="t-435000"&&Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature.
id="t-443000"&&She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
id="t-443000"&&She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
id="t-443000"&&She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
id="t-455000"&&All we've go to do is make it sterile.
id="t-455000"&&All we've go to do is make it sterile.

id="t-459000"&&Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
id="t-462000"&&Or we could use one of these.
id="t-464000"&&The same technology, in a jerry can.
id="t-467000"&&This will process 25,000 liters of water; that's good enough for a family of four, for three years.
id="t-479000"&&And how much does it cost?
id="t-481000"&&About half a cent a day to run.
id="t-483000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-328000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-488000"&&So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.
id="t-499000"&&They can get it from a source nearby.
id="t-503000"&&So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.
id="t-514000"&&To put that into context, The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid.
id="t-523000"&&But why stop there?
id="t-526000"&&With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
id="t-532000"&&So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result, and the two million kids that die every year, will live.
id="t-483000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-328000"&&(Applause)
