id="t-0"&&There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there."
id="t-6000"&&My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.
id="t-13000"&&What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things.
id="t-25000"&&We all seem to think that, you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.
id="t-34000"&&And we use the word "nothing."
id="t-37000"&&Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.
id="t-40000"&&My mother told me that, when I was a child, that I should always respect the little things. 

What made me do this work?
What made me do this work?
id="t-51000"&&This all started when I was age five.
id="t-51000"&&This all started when I was age five.
id="t-51000"&&This all started when I was age five.
id="t-61000"&&So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."
id="t-66000"&&My world was seen as less.
id="t-71000"&&So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.
id="t-75000"&&I thought, I need to retreat into something else.
id="t-81000"&&So when my mother used to take me to school, she thought I was at school, and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned, and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. 

id="t-93000"&&Now, the one time I was in the shed, and my mother suspected something, thinking I was at school.
id="t-103000"&&My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.
id="t-107000"&&So you'd just see her feet.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) So I was hiding in the shed, like that.
id="t-118000"&&And all of a sudden ... And then I saw her legs.
id="t-127000"&&And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big -- and she lifted me up and she says, "How come you're not at school?"
id="t-135000"&&I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me, and using me as an example of failure.
id="t-144000"&&So I told her.
id="t-146000"&&At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way, but I told her I didn't feel right.
id="t-153000"&&And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
id="t-153000"&&And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
id="t-153000"&&And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
id="t-161000"&&But I didn't get it. 

id="t-163000"&&So I'm sitting there thinking.
id="t-165000"&&And as I looked down on the ground, I noticed there was some ants running around.
id="t-173000"&&And I went into this little fantasy world.
id="t-175000"&&And I thought, "These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?
id="t-182000"&&Or do they need somewhere to live?"
id="t-184000"&&So I thought "Perhaps, if I made these ants some apartments, they'll move in."
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) So I did.
id="t-200000"&&And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.
id="t-203000"&&And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass, constructed this little apartment.
id="t-210000"&&Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
id="t-215000"&&But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.
id="t-217000"&&And so they did.
id="t-217000"&&And so they did.
id="t-217000"&&And so they did.
id="t-226000"&&And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.
id="t-230000"&&And then I sat down and all the ants came along.
id="t-236000"&&And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-241000"&&And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."
id="t-243000"&&And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) And from there I was watching this little world.
id="t-253000"&&It became part of me. 

id="t-258000"&&When I discovered that I had this gift, I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see.
id="t-271000"&&So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge.
id="t-278000"&&So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
id="t-278000"&&So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
id="t-278000"&&So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
id="t-287000"&&My mother told me to take it smaller. 

id="t-289000"&&Now I shall show you something here.
id="t-293000"&&And I'll explain.
id="t-296000"&&As you can see, that's a pinhead. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-305000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-313000"&&Now that is called the Huf Haus.
id="t-317000"&&The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf.
id="t-322000"&&And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-331000"&&So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-337000"&&And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it.
id="t-337000"&&And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it.

id="t-343000"&&And I says, "Well, try me."
id="t-343000"&&And I says, "Well, try me."
id="t-343000"&&And I says, "Well, try me."

id="t-353000"&&So, to cut a long story short, I went home, went underneath the microscope, and I crushed up a piece of glass, crushed it up.
id="t-363000"&&And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass.
id="t-367000"&&Some of them were quite jagged.
id="t-370000"&&So I was crushing up these pieces of glass, which, as you can see, that's the actual frame of the house.
id="t-377000"&&And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) So I got the teddy bear and I said, "Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"
id="t-198000"&&So I did.
id="t-198000"&&So I did.
id="t-198000"&&So I did.
id="t-399000"&&So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.
id="t-407000"&&And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system.
id="t-412000"&&And then I work between my heartbeat, I have one-and-a-half seconds to actually move.
id="t-420000"&&And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work, at the same time.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Because that has happened to me. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-439000"&&So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.
id="t-442000"&&I found these little bits of glass.
id="t-444000"&&And I had to make them square.
id="t-447000"&&So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
id="t-447000"&&So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
id="t-447000"&&So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
id="t-447000"&&So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
id="t-447000"&&So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
id="t-457000"&&I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.
id="t-460000"&&And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.
id="t-464000"&&And then I started rubbing, very very gently, till some of the edges were quite square.
id="t-464000"&&And then I started rubbing, very very gently, till some of the edges were quite square.
id="t-473000"&&And how I constructed it, is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.
id="t-478000"&&And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.
id="t-481000"&&And as I was doing it, what happened?
id="t-484000"&&The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
id="t-488000"&&And it went like this ... And then that was it. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-496000"&&Gone.
id="t-498000"&&So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another, into the atmosphere somewhere."
id="t-506000"&&So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it.
id="t-506000"&&So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it.
id="t-506000"&&So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it.
id="t-520000"&&Because it's such a small sculpture, nothing can go wrong.
id="t-526000"&&And I decided to build it up.
id="t-529000"&&Then I used fibers out of my jumper, which I held and stretched.
id="t-534000"&&And made the beams going around the house.
id="t-536000"&&And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.
id="t-540000"&&I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things, which sent me insane.
id="t-546000"&&But I managed to do it.
id="t-549000"&&And when I finished it, I came back the next day.
id="t-552000"&&I noticed that the house was occupied.
id="t-556000"&&Have we ever heard of a dust mite?
id="t-560000"&&Darren dust mite and his family moved in. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-565000"&&So basically I'd completed the house.
id="t-569000"&&And there you are. 

id="t-305000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

Right.
id="t-296000"&&As you can see, Bart Simpson is having a little argument.
id="t-589000"&&I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.
id="t-592000"&&There's not enough room for the two of them.
id="t-595000"&&So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
id="t-597000"&&I think he was just warning him actually.
id="t-599000"&&But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.
id="t-605000"&&What I did, I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope.
id="t-611000"&&I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
id="t-614000"&&Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle? 

id="t-616000"&&Audience: No. 

id="t-618000"&&WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very, very slowly, manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
id="t-632000"&&Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.
id="t-635000"&&Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different.
id="t-639000"&&And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.
id="t-642000"&&And, you know, all different things happen.
id="t-645000"&&But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane, to stop it moving.
id="t-650000"&&Then static electricity set in.
id="t-652000"&&And it went ... And I'm trying to remove it.
id="t-652000"&&And it went ... And I'm trying to remove it.
id="t-657000"&&So there is sweat dripping off my head, because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.
id="t-665000"&&And after I've cut out the shape, then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. 

id="t-671000"&&So after I've done the same thing, then I have to paint it.
id="t-675000"&&And after I've actually sculpted them, I have to paint them.
id="t-679000"&&I experimented with a -- I found a dead fly.
id="t-684000"&&And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.
id="t-686000"&&Decided to make a paintbrush.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) But I would never do it to a living fly.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.
id="t-709000"&&Even though they get on our nerves, I would never kill an insect because, "All creatures great and small" -- there is a hymn that says that.
id="t-719000"&&So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face.
id="t-726000"&&And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
id="t-730000"&&That was the paintbrush.
id="t-732000"&&And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
id="t-737000"&&And it starts to dry very quickly.
id="t-741000"&&So I have to be very quick.
id="t-744000"&&If I'm not, it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like.
id="t-749000"&&It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.
id="t-754000"&&So I have to be very very careful. 

id="t-756000"&&This one took me approximately, I would say, six to seven weeks.
id="t-763000"&&My work, rough estimate, sometimes five, six to seven weeks; you can't always anticipate.
id="t-305000"&&(Applause) As you can see, that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"
id="t-296000"&&As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.
id="t-802000"&&That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture.
id="t-807000"&&I would say it probably measures ... a quarter of a millimeter.
id="t-814000"&&In America they say a period stop.
id="t-816000"&&So say if you cut a period stop in half, a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.
id="t-823000"&&It's made -- the chariot is made of gold. 

id="t-827000"&&And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber, which I took out of the air.
id="t-833000"&&When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.
id="t-836000"&&And what I normally do is walk 'round a room -- (Laughter) -- trying to find one.
id="t-836000"&&And what I normally do is walk 'round a room -- (Laughter) -- trying to find one.
id="t-846000"&&I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.
id="t-849000"&&And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
id="t-851000"&&And she saw me walking around like this.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) And then she looked at me.
id="t-858000"&&And then I went ... And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."
id="t-866000"&&Yeah, to actually do this thing -- the actual chariot is made of gold.
id="t-872000"&&I had a 24-karat gold ring.
id="t-874000"&&And I cut off a little flake of gold.
id="t-876000"&&And I bent it 'round, and made it into the chariot.
id="t-880000"&&And the horse is made from nylon.
id="t-882000"&&And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
id="t-885000"&&To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult, because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action. 

id="t-893000"&&When I did this one, a gentleman seen it and said to me, "There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.
id="t-900000"&&There's no way a man can do that.
id="t-902000"&&It must be a machine."
id="t-904000"&&So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..." (Laughter) (Applause) That one took me approximately six weeks.
id="t-305000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-934000"&&The most famous statue in the world.
id="t-937000"&&This one, I would say, was a serious challenge.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Because I had to put the torch on the top.
id="t-956000"&&That one is, more or less, the same type of process.
id="t-960000"&&The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand, because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.
id="t-968000"&&I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base.
id="t-973000"&&Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this, because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of, you know, the beginning of people coming to America.
id="t-985000"&&So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.
id="t-989000"&&And that's the first thing they saw.
id="t-991000"&&So I wanted to have that little image.
id="t-993000"&&And this is it.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1005000"&&And we all know that is the Hulk.
id="t-1008000"&&I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.
id="t-1011000"&&Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it.
id="t-1017000"&&So I broke the needle.
id="t-1019000"&&And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it.
id="t-1024000"&&It's -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.
id="t-1027000"&&So most of my work, I don't use glue.
id="t-1030000"&&They go in with their own friction.
id="t-1032000"&&And that's how I managed to do it.
id="t-296000"&&As you can see, he's looking at the moment.
id="t-296000"&&As you can see, he's looking at the moment.
id="t-1036000"&&And his mouth must be probably about three microns.
id="t-1043000"&&So the eyes are probably about one micron or something. 

id="t-1049000"&&That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.
id="t-1055000"&&And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
id="t-1059000"&&But I had to rig it with strands of glue.
id="t-1062000"&&Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off.
id="t-1062000"&&Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off.
id="t-1062000"&&Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off.
id="t-1062000"&&Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off.
id="t-1071000"&&Constructed each plank of gold.
id="t-1075000"&&And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
id="t-1078000"&&The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.
id="t-1081000"&&It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
id="t-305000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-296000"&&As you can see, dressage.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.
id="t-1104000"&&The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing.
id="t-1109000"&&And that was done with a particle from my shirt.
id="t-1114000"&&And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle.
id="t-1123000"&&It's very painstaking work, but the best things come in small packages. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1130000"&&Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan! 

id="t-305000"&&(Applause)
