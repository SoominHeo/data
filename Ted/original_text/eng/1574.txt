id="t-0"&&So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.
id="t-8000"&&And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
id="t-11000"&&And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.
id="t-17000"&&And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this.
id="t-17000"&&And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this.
id="t-24000"&&And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. 

id="t-32000"&&Actually our body doesn't hate these.
id="t-32000"&&Actually our body doesn't hate these.
id="t-32000"&&Actually our body doesn't hate these.
id="t-37000"&&I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
id="t-40000"&&And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell, it means "that's food."
id="t-47000"&&Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
id="t-56000"&&But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity. 

id="t-63000"&&And I said, why don't you use that?
id="t-65000"&&What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
id="t-74000"&&I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there, where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
id="t-84000"&&It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.
id="t-96000"&&It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street. 

id="t-100000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-102000"&&So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.
id="t-110000"&&And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
id="t-114000"&&Our antibiotics are running out.
id="t-116000"&&And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
id="t-119000"&&So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.
id="t-119000"&&So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.

id="t-131000"&&So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.
id="t-137000"&&And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones, bacteria that we don't like.
id="t-146000"&&And I feel now like George Bush.
id="t-150000"&&It's like "mission accomplished."
id="t-152000"&&So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
id="t-155000"&&But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
id="t-155000"&&But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
id="t-155000"&&But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.

id="t-163000"&&This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.
id="t-170000"&&You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
id="t-173000"&&And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
id="t-177000"&&So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
id="t-177000"&&So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
id="t-177000"&&So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
id="t-190000"&&And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
id="t-193000"&&That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it. 

Here's what happened.
Here's what happened.
id="t-204000"&&That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
id="t-212000"&&And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.
id="t-220000"&&You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line -- that's a 100 percent survival rate.
id="t-224000"&&And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
id="t-232000"&&Why did they not die?
id="t-234000"&&And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
id="t-234000"&&And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
id="t-234000"&&And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.

id="t-239000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-241000"&&Mission accomplished! 

id="t-239000"&&(Applause)
