id="t-0"&&I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war.
id="t-7000"&&But today I've got a personal story to share with you.
id="t-9000"&&This is a picture of my family, my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.
id="t-16000"&&And we're actually Cambodians.
id="t-18000"&&And this picture is taken in Vietnam.
id="t-20000"&&So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?
id="t-24000"&&Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during 1975 and 1979. 

id="t-32000"&&Video: April 17th, 1975.
id="t-36000"&&The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam, and American bombing campaigns.
id="t-47000"&&Led by peasant-born Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia, much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.
id="t-63000"&&The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.
id="t-67000"&&But after four years the grim truth seeps out.
id="t-71000"&&In a country of only seven million people, one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders, their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. 

id="t-81000"&&Sophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration, on April 17th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh.
id="t-88000"&&And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.
id="t-95000"&&And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
id="t-97000"&&They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.
id="t-100000"&&And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict, because they're easy to bring into wars. 

id="t-106000"&&The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.
id="t-110000"&&I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan, including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945.
id="t-123000"&&The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.
id="t-126000"&&So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed.
id="t-130000"&&But not just that, they actually banned money.
id="t-133000"&&I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used.
id="t-137000"&&And we know money is the root of all evil, but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact. 

id="t-143000"&&My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.
id="t-147000"&&This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.
id="t-149000"&&It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia, where rice growing takes place.
id="t-154000"&&And in fact they were forced to work the fields.
id="t-156000"&&So my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp, labor camp. 

id="t-162000"&&And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.
id="t-172000"&&And she spoke some Vietnamese, as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.
id="t-177000"&&And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive, because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.
id="t-189000"&&And they're giving about -- in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess -- they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice. 

id="t-198000"&&And at about this time actually my father got very sick.
id="t-202000"&&And he didn't speak Vietnamese.
id="t-204000"&&So he died actually, in January 1976.
id="t-207000"&&And it made it possible, in fact, for us to take on this plan.
id="t-212000"&&So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev, which is across from the border from Vietnam.
id="t-219000"&&And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested. 

id="t-225000"&&And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible, she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.
id="t-235000"&&But she'd given the boys girls' names, and the girls boys' names.
id="t-240000"&&And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively, that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.
id="t-252000"&&If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows; if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.
id="t-257000"&&And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.
id="t-261000"&&And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.
id="t-264000"&&And then onwards to Chau Doc.
id="t-266000"&&And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.
id="t-268000"&&A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.
id="t-270000"&&But for us it meant freedom.
id="t-272000"&&And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. 

id="t-277000"&&Last year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on, started, and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.
id="t-290000"&&And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
id="t-296000"&&And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future, because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times. 

id="t-306000"&&Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.
id="t-310000"&&And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom, but also fear, because we had just come out of Cambodia.
id="t-318000"&&I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.
id="t-322000"&&She's here today with us in the audience.
id="t-324000"&&Thank you mother. 

id="t-326000"&&(Applause)
