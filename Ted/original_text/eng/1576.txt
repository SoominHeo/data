id="t-0"&&Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz.
id="t-11000"&&And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists.
id="t-16000"&&David Sibbet from The Grove, and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk, made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas.
id="t-27000"&&And the consensus was: it really worked.
id="t-29000"&&These sketches brought to life the key ideas, the portraits, the magic moments that we all experienced last year. 

id="t-37000"&&This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"
id="t-40000"&&What is it about animation, graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?
id="t-45000"&&And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning, the better we can communicate, and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.
id="t-56000"&&So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes. 

id="t-60000"&&Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is, but instead, creates a series of mental models through a collection of "Ah-ha moments," or moments of discovery, through various processes. 

id="t-72000"&&The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.
id="t-75000"&&Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated, most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain, at the primary visual cortex.
id="t-83000"&&And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry, just the simplest of shapes.
id="t-88000"&&But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain.
id="t-96000"&&As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense, create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.
id="t-102000"&&We're only going to talk about three of them. 

id="t-104000"&&So the first one is called the ventral stream.
id="t-107000"&&It's on this side of the brain.
id="t-109000"&&And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.
id="t-113000"&&It's the "what" detector.
id="t-113000"&&It's the "what" detector.
id="t-113000"&&It's the "what" detector.
id="t-113000"&&It's the "what" detector.
id="t-113000"&&It's the "what" detector.
id="t-119000"&&So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something. 

id="t-124000"&&A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
id="t-127000"&&And what it does is locates the object in physical body space.
id="t-133000"&&So if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.
id="t-138000"&&And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.
id="t-141000"&&You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that. 

id="t-144000"&&The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
id="t-144000"&&The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
id="t-144000"&&The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
id="t-151000"&&And it's the part that feels.
id="t-153000"&&It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image and you go, "Oh!
id="t-153000"&&It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image and you go, "Oh!

id="t-161000"&&So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways.
id="t-161000"&&So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways.
id="t-161000"&&So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways.
id="t-171000"&&Well, again, the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.
id="t-176000"&&The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. 

id="t-183000"&&So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around, to selectively create a visual logic.
id="t-191000"&&So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.
id="t-196000"&&It's the selective logic.
id="t-198000"&&Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.
id="t-201000"&&Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall.
id="t-209000"&&And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
id="t-211000"&&So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning.
id="t-216000"&&It activates a different part of the brain.
id="t-219000"&&And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion, when we see color, and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before. 

id="t-229000"&&So the point of this is what?
id="t-231000"&&We make meaning by seeing, by an act of visual interrogation.
id="t-236000"&&The lessons for us are three-fold.
id="t-238000"&&First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.
id="t-242000"&&Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully.
id="t-247000"&&And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence.
id="t-251000"&&These are techniques that can be used to be -- that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving. 

id="t-258000"&&So the low-tech version looks like this.
id="t-260000"&&And, by the way, this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk, in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.
id="t-269000"&&What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall.
id="t-276000"&&And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.
id="t-280000"&&There's always a room, always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan. 

id="t-287000"&&This is a time-lapse view of it.
id="t-290000"&&You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"
id="t-290000"&&You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"
id="t-290000"&&You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"
id="t-308000"&&No Powerpoint is used in two days.
id="t-310000"&&But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on. 

id="t-317000"&&And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology.
id="t-322000"&&And this is our great unveiling for today.
id="t-325000"&&And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible.
id="t-335000"&&Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.
id="t-338000"&&So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen. 

id="t-349000"&&So making images meaningful has three components.
id="t-352000"&&The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.
id="t-355000"&&Secondly, making them interactive.
id="t-357000"&&And then thirdly, making them persistent.
id="t-359000"&&And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today.
id="t-359000"&&And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today.
