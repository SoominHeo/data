id="t-0"&&This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. 

id="t-9000"&&Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted.
id="t-19000"&&Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others.
id="t-25000"&&Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum, and there are no tests.
id="t-30000"&&We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. 

id="t-34000"&&When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools.
id="t-48000"&&It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
id="t-53000"&&And within that context, we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives.
id="t-63000"&&Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. 

id="t-78000"&&Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
id="t-83000"&&(Laughter) And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- (Laughter) and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success, or gleeful calamity.
id="t-104000"&&We start from doodles and sketches.
id="t-108000"&&And sometimes we make real plans.
id="t-111000"&&And sometimes we just start building.
id="t-115000"&&Building is at the heart of the experience: hands on, deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand.
id="t-125000"&&Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion.
id="t-133000"&&Success is in the doing, and failures are celebrated and analyzed.
id="t-139000"&&Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. 

id="t-146000"&&When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
id="t-83000"&&(Laughter) Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation.
id="t-164000"&&From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. 

id="t-175000"&&All materials are available for use.
id="t-180000"&&Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined.
id="t-192000"&&And the things that they build amaze even themselves. 

id="t-198000"&&Video: Three, two, one, go! 

id="t-209000"&&Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds. 

id="t-213000"&&Video: Yay!
id="t-216000"&&(Applause) 

GT: Thank you.
GT: Thank you.
