id="t-0"&&Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country.
id="t-15000"&&And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. 

id="t-19000"&&The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
id="t-25000"&&And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.
id="t-30000"&&And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
id="t-34000"&&And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics.

I mean, don't get me wrong.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
id="t-55000"&&It's one of the great products of the human mind.
id="t-57000"&&The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
id="t-61000"&&And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college.
id="t-69000"&&But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
id="t-79000"&&On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis.
id="t-79000"&&On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis.

id="t-79000"&&On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis.
id="t-90000"&&It's understanding data. 

id="t-92000"&&I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.

id="t-108000"&&I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

id="t-118000"&&Look, the world has changed from analog to digital.
id="t-123000"&&And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. 

id="t-142000"&&In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means.
