Life is temptation.
Life is temptation.
id="t-68000"&&Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. 

id="t-70000"&&Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
id="t-79000"&&And most of them did so without using birth control.
id="t-82000"&&So much for promises. 

id="t-84000"&&Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
id="t-84000"&&Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
id="t-84000"&&Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
id="t-92000"&&Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
id="t-95000"&&What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
id="t-95000"&&What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
id="t-95000"&&What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
id="t-95000"&&What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
id="t-95000"&&What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.

id="t-105000"&&Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford, went back 14 years later, to try to discover what was different about those kids.
id="t-112000"&&There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways.
id="t-116000"&&The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
id="t-116000"&&The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.

So what is time perspective?
So what is time perspective?
id="t-137000"&&Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.
id="t-145000"&&And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
id="t-147000"&&They vary between cultures, between nations, between individuals, between social classes, between education levels.
id="t-153000"&&And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. 

id="t-159000"&&What determines any decision you make?
id="t-161000"&&You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
id="t-164000"&&For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
id="t-170000"&&And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented," because their focus is what is now. 

id="t-177000"&&For others, the present is irrelevant.
id="t-179000"&&It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
id="t-182000"&&So that their decisions are based on past memories.
id="t-185000"&&And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was. 

id="t-189000"&&For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future.
id="t-193000"&&Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.
id="t-195000"&&Cost-benefit analysis.
id="t-195000"&&Cost-benefit analysis.
id="t-195000"&&Cost-benefit analysis.

id="t-201000"&&So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of.
id="t-210000"&&Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
id="t-210000"&&Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
id="t-210000"&&Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
id="t-217000"&&There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
id="t-219000"&&You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
id="t-223000"&&You can be present-hedonistic, namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist -- it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
id="t-230000"&&You can be future-oriented, setting goals.
id="t-232000"&&Or you can be transcendental future: namely, life begins after death.
id="t-237000"&&Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation, that's what you've got to learn to do. 

id="t-244000"&&So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
id="t-244000"&&So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
id="t-244000"&&So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
id="t-249000"&&And moderate on present-hedonism.
id="t-251000"&&And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism.
id="t-256000"&&So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots.
id="t-256000"&&So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots.
id="t-263000"&&What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations, new challenges.
id="t-267000"&&What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality. 

id="t-276000"&&Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-280000"&&What do futures sacrifice for success?
id="t-294000"&&And they live for work, achievement and control.
id="t-297000"&&I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
id="t-57000"&&(Laughter) 

And it resonated for me.
And it resonated for me.
id="t-308000"&&I'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
id="t-316000"&&Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.
id="t-323000"&&I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive, so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been. 

id="t-334000"&&I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems: changing the drop-out rates of school kids, combating addictions, enhancing teen health, curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation, reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate, altering appeals to suicidal terrorists, and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes. 

id="t-356000"&&So I want to end by saying: many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
id="t-364000"&&And the idea is so simple, so obvious, but I think the consequences are really profound.
id="t-368000"&&Thank you so much.
id="t-370000"&&(Applause)
