id="t-0"&&My journey to coming here today started in 1974.
id="t-6000"&&That's me with the funny gloves.
id="t-9000"&&I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
id="t-12000"&&What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there with me, were Moonies.
id="t-17000"&&(Laughter) And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred, that it was Sun Myung Moon, and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple. 

id="t-36000"&&Now as cool as that sounds, my family was not that thrilled with this.
id="t-17000"&&(Laughter) And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
id="t-44000"&&There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years.
id="t-44000"&&There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years.
id="t-49000"&&They were called deprogrammers.
id="t-52000"&&And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed.
id="t-60000"&&And I then became a deprogrammer.
id="t-65000"&&I started going out on cases.
id="t-67000"&&And after about five years of doing this, I was arrested for kidnapping.
id="t-75000"&&Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary.
id="t-79000"&&What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
id="t-84000"&&And so they took them to some safe place.
id="t-88000"&&And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.
id="t-91000"&&And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. 

id="t-99000"&&And about 20 years went by.
id="t-104000"&&There was a burning question though that would not leave me.
id="t-107000"&&And that was, "How did this happen to me?"
id="t-110000"&&And in fact, what did happen to my brain?
id="t-113000"&&Because something did.
id="t-116000"&&And so I decided to write a book, a memoir, about this decade of my life. 

id="t-121000"&&And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out.
id="t-125000"&&It was on Jonestown.
id="t-127000"&&And it had a chilling effect on me.
id="t-132000"&&These are the dead in Jonestown.
id="t-135000"&&About 900 people died that day, most of them taking their own lives.
id="t-140000"&&Women gave poison to their babies, and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. 

id="t-149000"&&The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah.
id="t-155000"&&Their mates were chosen for them.
id="t-158000"&&The bottom picture is Hitler youth.
id="t-162000"&&This is the leg of a suicide bomber.
id="t-166000"&&The thing I had to admit to myself, with great repulsion, was that I get it.
id="t-173000"&&I understand how this could happen.
id="t-176000"&&I understand how someone's brain, how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense -- in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that -- not to try to save the world through genocide. 

And so what is this?
And so what is this?
id="t-196000"&&And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral, memetic infection.
id="t-203000"&&For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics, a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus, much like a virus.

id="t-226000"&&In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world.
id="t-232000"&&I was really idealistic.
id="t-235000"&&These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable.
id="t-242000"&&What happens is that circular logic takes over.
id="t-247000"&&"Moon is one with God.
id="t-249000"&&God is going to fix all the problems in the world.
id="t-253000"&&All I have to do is humbly follow.
id="t-255000"&&Because God is going to stop war and hunger -- all these things I wanted to do -- all I have to do is humbly follow.
id="t-255000"&&Because God is going to stop war and hunger -- all these things I wanted to do -- all I have to do is humbly follow.
id="t-255000"&&Because God is going to stop war and hunger -- all these things I wanted to do -- all I have to do is humbly follow.
id="t-264000"&&It becomes impenetrable.
id="t-267000"&&And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates "us" and "them," "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil."
id="t-279000"&&And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable. 

id="t-290000"&&And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday.
id="t-290000"&&And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday.
id="t-301000"&&We're beginning to look inside the brain.
id="t-304000"&&And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different. 

id="t-318000"&&And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.
id="t-323000"&&And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.

id="t-338000"&&And so this is something that, through research and education, I believe that we can solve.
id="t-345000"&&And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together, and that there is no "us" and "them."
