id="t-0"&&Why do so many people reach success and then fail?
id="t-5000"&&One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.
id="t-9000"&&So we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there.
id="t-9000"&&So we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there.
id="t-18000"&&And it doesn't take long to go downhill.
id="t-20000"&&And I can tell you this happens, because it happened to me. 

id="t-25000"&&Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.
id="t-28000"&&But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.
id="t-31000"&&I can just sit back and relax."

id="t-33000"&&Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.
id="t-37000"&&But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.
id="t-40000"&&I don't need to improve any more."

id="t-42000"&&Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.
id="t-46000"&&Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.
id="t-49000"&&But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.
id="t-55000"&&And the only thing that came was creative block.
id="t-57000"&&I couldn't come up with any ideas. 

id="t-60000"&&Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money.
id="t-60000"&&Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money.
id="t-66000"&&And I got distracted by it.
id="t-68000"&&And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent, when I should have been talking to my clients. 

id="t-74000"&&And reaching success, I always did what I loved.
id="t-77000"&&But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management.
id="t-77000"&&But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management.

id="t-86000"&&Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed.
id="t-93000"&&But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.
id="t-97000"&&I bought a fast car.
id="t-99000"&&(Laughter) It didn't help.
id="t-104000"&&I was faster but just as depressed. 

So I went to my doctor.
So I went to my doctor.
So I went to my doctor.
So I went to my doctor.
id="t-113000"&&It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.
id="t-116000"&&But money can't buy happiness."
id="t-116000"&&But money can't buy happiness."
id="t-116000"&&But money can't buy happiness."
id="t-122000"&&And he put me on anti-depressants.
id="t-124000"&&And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work, because I was just floating along.
id="t-124000"&&And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work, because I was just floating along.
id="t-99000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-135000"&&And clients didn't call.
id="t-99000"&&(Laughter) Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself.
id="t-142000"&&So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. 

id="t-145000"&&Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.
id="t-149000"&&My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.
id="t-153000"&&It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.
id="t-155000"&&And that was great.
id="t-157000"&&Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage. 

id="t-161000"&&So I went back to doing the projects I loved.
id="t-164000"&&I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short, did all the things that took me back up to success.
id="t-171000"&&But it wasn't a quick trip.
id="t-173000"&&It took seven years. 

id="t-175000"&&But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.
id="t-178000"&&And when I went back to following these eight principles, the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.
id="t-184000"&&And I woke up one day and I said, "I don't need Prozac anymore."
id="t-188000"&&And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. 

id="t-190000"&&I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
id="t-193000"&&It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
id="t-196000"&&It's a continuous journey.
id="t-198000"&&And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome," we just keep following these eight principles, because that is not only how we achieve success, it's how we sustain it.
id="t-208000"&&So here is to your continued success.
id="t-210000"&&Thank you very much.
id="t-212000"&&(Applause)
