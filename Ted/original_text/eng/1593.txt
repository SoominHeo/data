id="t-0"&&What's happening to the climate?
id="t-2000"&&It is unbelievably bad.
id="t-4000"&&This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years.
id="t-4000"&&This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years.

id="t-12000"&&So we all look at what we can do.
id="t-14000"&&And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2, 52 percent are tied to buildings.
id="t-18000"&&Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.
id="t-21000"&&So we ran off to a sushi bar.
id="t-23000"&&And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.
id="t-25000"&&And it was something called EcoRock.
id="t-27000"&&And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.

id="t-39000"&&We started R&amp;D in 2006.
id="t-41000"&&Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing.
id="t-41000"&&Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing.
id="t-41000"&&Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing.
id="t-47000"&&But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
id="t-55000"&&And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.
id="t-57000"&&So then we went forward and built our production line in China.
id="t-60000"&&We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately. 

id="t-63000"&&We did the line install over the summer.
id="t-65000"&&We started right there, with absolutely nothing.
id="t-67000"&&You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line, not made using gypsum at all.
id="t-73000"&&That's the finished production line there.
id="t-75000"&&We got our first panel out on December third.
id="t-75000"&&We got our first panel out on December third.
id="t-75000"&&We got our first panel out on December third.
id="t-81000"&&The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
id="t-84000"&&These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
id="t-84000"&&These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
id="t-84000"&&These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
id="t-84000"&&These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
id="t-84000"&&These are people who worked this project for two to three years.

id="t-93000"&&But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.
id="t-96000"&&We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony, leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.
id="t-104000"&&And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.
id="t-106000"&&We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.

id="t-113000"&&So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.

id="t-120000"&&We must change everything.
id="t-122000"&&Look around the room: chairs, wood, everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.
id="t-128000"&&Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.
id="t-131000"&&And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.
id="t-131000"&&And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.

id="t-136000"&&We're going as fast as we can.
id="t-138000"&&Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum, you know, CO2 generated.

id="t-146000"&&Those are my kids, Natalie and David.
id="t-148000"&&When they have their kids, 2050, they'd better look back at Grandpa and say, "Hey, you gave it a good shot.

id="t-156000"&&So my hope is that when you leave TED, you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it.
id="t-163000"&&And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you. 

id="t-166000"&&Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.
id="t-169000"&&Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.
id="t-172000"&&Thank you so much.
id="t-174000"&&(Applause)
