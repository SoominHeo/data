id="t-0"&&I used to be a Malthusian.
id="t-3000"&&This was my mental model of the world: exploding population, small planet; it's going to lead to ugly things.
id="t-11000"&&But I'm moving past Malthus, because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment. 

id="t-18000"&&Here's why.
id="t-20000"&&This is the U.N.'s population data, you may have seen, for the world.
id="t-25000"&&And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.
id="t-31000"&&And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.
id="t-35000"&&So what then?
id="t-38000"&&Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.
id="t-41000"&&So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.
id="t-48000"&&But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects. 

id="t-55000"&&One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet.
id="t-64000"&&In the cities, a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.
id="t-72000"&&Take away land speculation, price of land drops.
id="t-76000"&&And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor. 

id="t-81000"&&Number two: a declining population means scarce labor.
id="t-87000"&&Scarce labor drives wages.
id="t-89000"&&As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.
id="t-96000"&&Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.
id="t-100000"&&But look what happened in Europe after the plague: rising wages, land reform, technological innovation, birth of the middle class; and after that, forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance, and later the Enlightenment. 

id="t-122000"&&Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward, romanticizing the past.
id="t-128000"&&All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden, and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future.
id="t-137000"&&So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days. 

id="t-143000"&&But I think we're in for another change, about two generations after the top of that curve, once the effects of a declining population start to settle in.
id="t-154000"&&At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again, instead of the nasty, brutish past. 

id="t-161000"&&So why does this matter?
id="t-163000"&&Why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away?
id="t-167000"&&Because transitions are dangerous times.
id="t-171000"&&When land owners start to lose money, and labor demands more pay, there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.
id="t-180000"&&Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.
id="t-184000"&&If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn, instead of careening off a cliff. 

id="t-193000"&&If we can make it through the next 150 years, I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus.
id="t-200000"&&And instead, they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.
id="t-207000"&&Thank you.
id="t-209000"&&(Applause)
