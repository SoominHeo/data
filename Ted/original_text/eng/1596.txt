id="t-1000"&&I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane.
id="t-7000"&&I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2; that is the weight of two elephants.
id="t-17000"&&I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year.
id="t-26000"&&So what do I have to do?
id="t-28000"&&I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time.
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-40000"&&In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet.
id="t-49000"&&I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. 

id="t-57000"&&Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.
id="t-62000"&&You know the problem; we don't want to believe what we know.
id="t-70000"&&In Alberta people work nonstop, 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can.
id="t-80000"&&We know about the end of oil.
id="t-83000"&&Oil sand is not a long-term solution.
id="t-87000"&&But we use three times more oil than we find every year.
id="t-93000"&&We don't want to believe what we know.
id="t-95000"&&Deny. 

id="t-97000"&&Coral reef in New Caledonia.
id="t-101000"&&100 percent of the coral may be wiped out before 2050 because of global warming.
id="t-109000"&&And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature, and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. 

North Pole.
North Pole.
id="t-123000"&&It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.
id="t-127000"&&Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.
id="t-133000"&&The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960. 

id="t-145000"&&There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.
id="t-149000"&&Sad picture.
id="t-151000"&&It lost 80 percent of its ice.
id="t-154000"&&According to scientists, in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone.
id="t-162000"&&Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.
id="t-166000"&&Like Al Gore told you, two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. 

id="t-173000"&&Return of fish men.
id="t-175000"&&One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live.
id="t-183000"&&Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited.
id="t-190000"&&According to FAO, if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
id="t-93000"&&We don't want to believe what we know. 

id="t-205000"&&The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.
id="t-210000"&&One human of six have not enough to eat in the world.
id="t-215000"&&One billion people have not enough to eat.
id="t-218000"&&In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.
id="t-224000"&&Here in America, 90 percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. 

id="t-235000"&&Palm tree plantation in Borneo.
id="t-239000"&&Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation. 

id="t-249000"&&Refugee camp in Darfur.
id="t-252000"&&Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.
id="t-256000"&&According to the U.N., we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050. 

id="t-267000"&&I always show my pictures in the street.
id="t-270000"&&We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
id="t-273000"&&But how to understand the world without the voice of people?
id="t-280000"&&Landscape was not enough.
id="t-283000"&&It was obvious to me to do another work.
id="t-286000"&&I launched a project named Six Billion Others.
id="t-291000"&&I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question, the same crucial question, about life.
id="t-301000"&&We have done five thousand interviews.
id="t-304000"&&I'm going to show you this. 

id="t-312000"&&Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
id="t-315000"&&It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."

Woman: Love?
Woman: Love?

id="t-326000"&&Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha, this is love!
id="t-326000"&&Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha, this is love!

id="t-332000"&&Woman: You're asking me a hard question. 

id="t-334000"&&Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do? 

id="t-337000"&&Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,) Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)
id="t-337000"&&Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,) Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)
id="t-337000"&&Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,) Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)

id="t-347000"&&Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic. 

id="t-353000"&&Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
id="t-355000"&&Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful. 

id="t-360000"&&10th Man: In the word life, you have the life. 

11th Man: Who am I?
11th Man: Who am I?

id="t-368000"&&12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people, I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
id="t-374000"&&Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons.
id="t-381000"&&I feel ashamed.
id="t-384000"&&And I feel humbled by their strength.
id="t-388000"&&And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. 

id="t-398000"&&Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.
id="t-398000"&&Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.
id="t-398000"&&Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.
id="t-407000"&&My family ... What can I say?
id="t-411000"&&At the moment, my family is very poor, my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
id="t-426000"&&I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
id="t-432000"&&If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
id="t-442000"&&Thank you.
id="t-445000"&&Thank you for having fed me and raised me, and for making my life of today.
id="t-442000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-454000"&&13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
id="t-454000"&&13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
id="t-454000"&&13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
id="t-454000"&&13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
id="t-466000"&&After many people said I couldn't do that.
id="t-471000"&&And I think that comes from connecting with nature, connecting with the energy of life, because we're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually, mentally or physically.
id="t-483000"&&I got the easy part. 

id="t-488000"&&14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.
id="t-492000"&&You come from elsewhere.
id="t-492000"&&You come from elsewhere.
id="t-492000"&&You come from elsewhere.
id="t-499000"&&We talk without lying.
id="t-501000"&&If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends.
id="t-509000"&&How can we make it all by ourselves? 

id="t-530000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-538000"&&YAB: You can also go to the website, answer -- respond to the questions also.
id="t-543000"&&Forty crucial questions. 

id="t-545000"&&Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
id="t-548000"&&For the last three years, I was shooting the earth for the movie.
id="t-554000"&&The name of the movie is "Home" -- "Maison."
id="t-560000"&&It is about the state of the planet.
id="t-563000"&&It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
id="t-567000"&&I'm very proud to show you the teaser. 

id="t-570000"&&Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
id="t-583000"&&These plants, several hundred million years old.
id="t-588000"&&And we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years.
id="t-596000"&&We've managed to adapt, and have conquered the whole planet.
id="t-603000"&&For generations, we've been raising our children, not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
id="t-612000"&&For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky.
id="t-619000"&&Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
id="t-624000"&&We depend on water, forests, deserts, oceans.
id="t-635000"&&Fishing, breeding, farming are still the world's foremost human occupations.
id="t-646000"&&And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us.
id="t-652000"&&We all share the same need for the earth's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves, and become better.
id="t-664000"&&And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. 

id="t-669000"&&Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
id="t-674000"&&In less than 50 years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind.
id="t-681000"&&Half of the world's forests have vanished.
id="t-684000"&&Water resources are running low.
id="t-686000"&&Intensive farming is depleting soils.
id="t-691000"&&Our energy sources are not sustainable.
id="t-694000"&&The climate is changing.
id="t-696000"&&We are endangering ourselves.
id="t-699000"&&We're only trying to improve our lives.
id="t-702000"&&But the wealth gaps are growing wider.
id="t-705000"&&We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain.
id="t-732000"&&We know that solutions are available today.
id="t-738000"&&We all have the power to change this trend for the better.
id="t-748000"&&So what are we waiting for?
id="t-530000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-781000"&&YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
id="t-785000"&&But it is not a normal movie.
id="t-789000"&&The film is going to be distributed free.
id="t-794000"&&This film has no copyright.
id="t-798000"&&On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.
id="t-808000"&&The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June.
id="t-819000"&&There is no business on this movie.
id="t-822000"&&It is also available for school, cities, NGOs and you. 

id="t-829000"&&We have to believe what we know.
id="t-833000"&&Let me tell you something.
id="t-837000"&&It's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late.
id="t-844000"&&We have all a part of the solutions.
id="t-851000"&&To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk.
id="t-851000"&&To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk.
id="t-851000"&&To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk.
id="t-530000"&&(Applause)
