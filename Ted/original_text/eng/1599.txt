id="t-15000"&&And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless.
id="t-28000"&&So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line.

id="t-47000"&&(Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason.
id="t-47000"&&(Laughter) Somewhat like the curving of the universe. 

I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
id="t-47000"&&(Laughter) "You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."

id="t-47000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-48000"&&(Applause) Thank you very much.
