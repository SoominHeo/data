id="t-0"&&I'm here because I have a very important message: I think we have found the most important factor for success.
id="t-8000"&&And it was found close to here, Stanford.
id="t-13000"&&Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves.
id="t-21000"&&And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid, "Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes.
id="t-29000"&&If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here, you will get another one.
id="t-29000"&&If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here, you will get another one.
id="t-37000"&&To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like, is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) Exact equivalent. 

id="t-49000"&&So what happened when the professor left the room?
id="t-54000"&&As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow.
id="t-60000"&&Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.
id="t-65000"&&Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) Couldn't do it.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) Couldn't do it.
id="t-73000"&&What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... Would look at it.
id="t-83000"&&Put it back.
id="t-83000"&&Put it back.
id="t-83000"&&Put it back.

id="t-90000"&&That child already, at four, understood the most important principle for success, which is the ability to delay gratification.
id="t-100000"&&Self-discipline: the most important factor for success.
id="t-105000"&&15 years later, 14 or 15 years later, follow-up study.
id="t-110000"&&What did they find?
id="t-112000"&&They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.
id="t-115000"&&And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
id="t-115000"&&And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
id="t-115000"&&And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
id="t-115000"&&And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
id="t-115000"&&And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
id="t-126000"&&They had good relationships with the teachers, students.
id="t-129000"&&They were doing fine. 

id="t-130000"&&A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow, they were in trouble.
id="t-134000"&&They did not make it to university.
id="t-134000"&&They did not make it to university.
id="t-134000"&&They did not make it to university.
id="t-138000"&&A few were still there with bad grades.
id="t-140000"&&A few had good grades. 

id="t-142000"&&I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
id="t-142000"&&I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
id="t-142000"&&I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
id="t-142000"&&I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
id="t-142000"&&I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
id="t-153000"&&And let me show you what happened. 

id="t-171000"&&(Spanish) (Laughter) 

id="t-272000"&&So what happened in Colombia?
id="t-274000"&&Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow; one out of three did not.
id="t-279000"&&This little girl was interesting; she ate the inside of the marshmallow.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.
id="t-288000"&&But she ate it.
id="t-288000"&&But she ate it.
id="t-288000"&&But she ate it.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) She should not go into banking, for example, or work at a cash register.
id="t-299000"&&But she will be successful. 

And this applies for everything.
And this applies for everything.
id="t-303000"&&The sales person that -- the customer says, "I want that."
id="t-303000"&&The sales person that -- the customer says, "I want that."
id="t-309000"&&That person ate the marshmallow.
id="t-311000"&&If the sales person says, "Wait a second.
id="t-313000"&&Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."
id="t-316000"&&Then you sell a lot more.
id="t-317000"&&So this has applications in all walks of life. 

id="t-322000"&&I end with -- the Koreans did this.
id="t-322000"&&I end with -- the Koreans did this.
id="t-322000"&&I end with -- the Koreans did this.
id="t-322000"&&I end with -- the Koreans did this.
id="t-322000"&&I end with -- the Koreans did this.
id="t-332000"&&They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.
id="t-334000"&&And we need to learn that principle here in the States, because we have a big debt.
id="t-338000"&&We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.
id="t-340000"&&Thank you so much.
