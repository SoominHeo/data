id="t-2000"&&Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation.
id="t-6000"&&And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.
id="t-12000"&&I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands. 

id="t-16000"&&Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me. 

id="t-19000"&&FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.
id="t-22000"&&This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada. 

id="t-26000"&&YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there. 

id="t-30000"&&FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.
id="t-33000"&&This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom, much to the dismay of my mother. 

id="t-41000"&&YB: To the dismay of my mother, this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-49000"&&FN: And I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia -- also the U.S. and Japan. 

id="t-57000"&&YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.
id="t-61000"&&We had a lot that got us excited.
id="t-64000"&&So we decided to do a special project together.
id="t-67000"&&To combine engineering and design and ... 

id="t-71000"&&FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful. 

id="t-74000"&&YB: And we made a baby.
id="t-46000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-77000"&&FN: Can you bring out our baby?
id="t-85000"&&(Applause) This baby is fully electric.
id="t-90000"&&It goes 150 miles an hour.
id="t-92000"&&It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
id="t-95000"&&Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
id="t-102000"&&It's got an amazing user experience.
id="t-104000"&&It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
id="t-104000"&&It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
id="t-104000"&&It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
id="t-109000"&&And we've only got three minutes, but we could talk about it for hours. 

id="t-113000"&&YB: Thank you. 

FN: Thank you TED.
FN: Thank you TED.
id="t-85000"&&(Applause)
