id="t-0"&&This is a sculpture I made, which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom.
id="t-13000"&&So, it can balance on a point.
id="t-18000"&&This is a bronze ball, an aluminum arm here, and then this wooden disk.
id="t-25000"&&And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to, and that would glide easily through your hands.
id="t-34000"&&The aluminum is because it's very light.
id="t-37000"&&The bronze is nice hard, durable material that could roll on the ground.
id="t-41000"&&Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free-swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between, across it, like this, that counterbalance this weight.
id="t-58000"&&So it allows it to roll.
id="t-61000"&&And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction.
id="t-69000"&&But if you put something on top of it, it disbalances it.
id="t-69000"&&But if you put something on top of it, it disbalances it.
id="t-75000"&&But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point.
id="t-84000"&&And then there was a second level to this object, which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. 

id="t-103000"&&I was exploring, really early on, wanting to make things float in the air.
id="t-109000"&&And I thought up a lot of ideas.
id="t-111000"&&This is sculpture that I made that -- it's magnetically levitated.
id="t-119000"&&The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
id="t-121000"&&Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.
id="t-124000"&&But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without, um -- oops.
id="t-131000"&&So this is just floating, floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions.
id="t-140000"&&Except there is a slight tether here, which keeps it from going over the top of its field.
id="t-147000"&&It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave.
id="t-151000"&&And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. 

id="t-157000"&&I think we could roll the tape, admin.
id="t-160000"&&I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.
id="t-166000"&&This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth, in proportion.
id="t-171000"&&Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
id="t-171000"&&Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
id="t-171000"&&Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.

id="t-184000"&&And here is a similar sculpture.
id="t-186000"&&That's the Sun at that end.
id="t-188000"&&And then in a series of 55 balls, it reduces, proportionately -- each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately, until they get down to this little Earth.
id="t-201000"&&This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. 

id="t-210000"&&This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.
id="t-218000"&&This is a little stone ball, floating.
id="t-220000"&&As you can see the little tether, that it's also magnetically levitated. 

id="t-227000"&&And then this is the first part of -- this is 109 spheres, since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.
id="t-236000"&&And so this is the size of the Sun.
id="t-238000"&&And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
id="t-238000"&&And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
id="t-238000"&&And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
id="t-248000"&&This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
id="t-248000"&&This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
id="t-415000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-262000"&&So this, again, is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the Earth.
id="t-267000"&&And then the Moon in the center, and it's floating.
id="t-267000"&&And then the Moon in the center, and it's floating.

id="t-291000"&&This is in Sapporo.
id="t-293000"&&It's balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty.
id="t-305000"&&So you can see it rotating here.
id="t-307000"&&It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
id="t-309000"&&It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
id="t-311000"&&But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
id="t-313000"&&It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. 

id="t-320000"&&This is another species of work that I do.
id="t-320000"&&This is another species of work that I do.
id="t-320000"&&This is another species of work that I do.
id="t-330000"&&So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.
id="t-335000"&&And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.
id="t-338000"&&So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. 

id="t-341000"&&This is based on the structure of a diamond.
id="t-344000"&&It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure.
id="t-348000"&&And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms.
id="t-354000"&&And so I placed one more element of each one of them.
id="t-358000"&&These were white spheres.
id="t-360000"&&Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.
id="t-365000"&&So they would catch parts of the images, and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes, as you walk through it, through the object. 

id="t-377000"&&This is something I did of a tactile communication system.
id="t-382000"&&It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture, and then putting it into a communication system.
id="t-389000"&&This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball, that would be directed around the room by a computer. 

id="t-396000"&&This is a clock I designed.
id="t-398000"&&It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.
id="t-402000"&&It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. 

id="t-407000"&&And then, this is like projects that are harder to build.
id="t-415000"&&(Laughter) This has a diamond-bottomed lake.
id="t-419000"&&So it's a floating island with water, fresh water, that can fly from place to place.
id="t-425000"&&This would be grown, I suppose, with nanotechnology in the future sometime. 

id="t-431000"&&In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests.
id="t-438000"&&And some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sculpture, something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing, by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.
id="t-454000"&&And I had a lot of -- always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.
id="t-461000"&&And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future -- or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear.
id="t-472000"&&I had thought about, a long time ago, in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out, I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations -- and other things that were happening, the space program at that time, and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.
id="t-498000"&&I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. 

id="t-506000"&&So if we could roll the next film here.
id="t-511000"&&This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations.
id="t-515000"&&But this the current version of it, is a flying airship that is about 35 meters in diameter, about 110 feet in diameter.
id="t-525000"&&The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes, red, blue, and green, that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight. 

id="t-534000"&&I came with a plan.
id="t-536000"&&I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.
id="t-547000"&&So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.
id="t-551000"&&This is the control room inside of the ship.
id="t-556000"&&The idea of this air genie is, it's something that can just transform and become anything.
id="t-561000"&&It's like a traveling show.
id="t-561000"&&It's like a traveling show.
id="t-561000"&&It's like a traveling show.
id="t-569000"&&So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
id="t-574000"&&Here the legs are retracting.
id="t-576000"&&The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
id="t-579000"&&It weighs about 20 tons.
id="t-582000"&&It has on-board generators.
id="t-584000"&&It can generate about a million kilowatts, in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight.
id="t-591000"&&The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.
id="t-594000"&&It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.
id="t-599000"&&There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians, that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment, and to interact as an entity that was aware, that could communicate.
id="t-615000"&&It's completely silent and nonpolluting.
id="t-618000"&&It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.
id="t-622000"&&It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. 

id="t-626000"&&Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with, say, going to a college campus, and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences, the world, the situation of the globe.
id="t-638000"&&The default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
id="t-644000"&&But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today. 

id="t-654000"&&And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation, where the people could cut loose, and the music and the lights, and everything.
id="t-666000"&&So it could land in a park, for example.
id="t-668000"&&Or this could represent a college green.
id="t-671000"&&And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this.
id="t-676000"&&And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
id="t-679000"&&It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it.
id="t-685000"&&It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.
id="t-691000"&&So that's pretty much it.
id="t-691000"&&So that's pretty much it.
id="t-691000"&&So that's pretty much it.
id="t-696000"&&(Applause)
