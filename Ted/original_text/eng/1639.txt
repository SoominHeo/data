id="t-0"&&Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.
id="t-3000"&&Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.
id="t-7000"&&Your iPhone, your laptop, is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.
id="t-12000"&&And we should save trees in the end.
id="t-15000"&&So it's enough to bury any industry.
id="t-18000"&&So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"

id="t-22000"&&There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.
id="t-24000"&&Some people say it should be free; it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4; it should be local, run by communities, or niche, for some smaller groups like business -- but then it's not free; it's very expensive.
id="t-38000"&&It should be opinion-driven; less news, more views.
id="t-43000"&&And we'd rather read it during breakfast, because later we listen to radio in a car, check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.
id="t-51000"&&Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.
id="t-54000"&&Because in the long run, I think there is no reason, no practical reason for newspapers to survive. 

id="t-61000"&&So what can we do?
id="t-63000"&&(Laughter) Let me tell you my story.
id="t-66000"&&20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher, started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.
id="t-73000"&&After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.
id="t-76000"&&They were run by an inexperienced staff, with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals -- in many places there were not even art directors.
id="t-86000"&&I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.
id="t-90000"&&Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once, "What are you doing for a living?"
id="t-95000"&&I said, "I'm designing newspapers."
id="t-95000"&&I said, "I'm designing newspapers."
id="t-95000"&&I said, "I'm designing newspapers."
id="t-95000"&&I said, "I'm designing newspapers."
id="t-95000"&&I said, "I'm designing newspapers."

id="t-105000"&&I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
id="t-105000"&&I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
id="t-105000"&&I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
id="t-119000"&&I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."
id="t-119000"&&I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."
id="t-119000"&&I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."
id="t-126000"&&The front page became our signature.
id="t-129000"&&It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers. 

id="t-133000"&&I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.
id="t-137000"&&My approach was very egotistic.
id="t-139000"&&I wanted my artistic statement, my interpretation of reality.
id="t-144000"&&I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.
id="t-146000"&&Not even magazines: posters.
id="t-148000"&&We were experimenting with type, with illustration, with photos.
id="t-148000"&&We were experimenting with type, with illustration, with photos.
id="t-154000"&&Soon it started to bring results.
id="t-157000"&&In Poland, our pages were named "Covers of the Year" three times in a row.
id="t-165000"&&Other examples you can see here are from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia -- the central European countries. 

id="t-173000"&&But it's not only about the front page.
id="t-176000"&&The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece, as one composition -- like music.
id="t-184000"&&And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.
id="t-188000"&&And design is responsible for this experience.
id="t-192000"&&Flipping through pages is readers experience, and I'm responsible for this experience.
id="t-197000"&&We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page, because that's how readers perceive it. 

id="t-203000"&&You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain.
id="t-209000"&&But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.
id="t-214000"&&Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland, they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.
id="t-219000"&&And two years later, the same award came to Estonia.
id="t-224000"&&Isn't amazing? 

id="t-227000"&&What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too.
id="t-231000"&&Just some examples: in Russia, plus 11 after one year, plus 29 after three years of the redesign.
id="t-238000"&&Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years.
id="t-244000"&&You can see on a graph, after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow, just after redesign.
id="t-252000"&&But the real hit was in Bulgaria.
id="t-254000"&&And that is really amazing. 

id="t-258000"&&Did design do this?
id="t-260000"&&Design was just a part of the process.
id="t-262000"&&And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely.
id="t-268000"&&I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design.
id="t-274000"&&And I put strategy at the top of it.
id="t-274000"&&And I put strategy at the top of it.
id="t-274000"&&And I put strategy at the top of it.
id="t-279000"&&Then we adjust the content accordingly.
id="t-281000"&&And then, usually after two months, we start designing.
id="t-284000"&&My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.
id="t-286000"&&Why am I asking all of these business questions, instead of just showing them pages?
id="t-290000"&&But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer: to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. 

id="t-295000"&&So what is the lesson behind it?
id="t-297000"&&The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.
id="t-301000"&&It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down.
id="t-307000"&&It can even change you.
id="t-307000"&&It can even change you.
id="t-307000"&&It can even change you.
id="t-312000"&&Give power to designers.
id="t-314000"&&(Applause) But the second is even more important.
id="t-321000"&&You can live in a small poor country, like me.
id="t-324000"&&You can work for a small company, in a boring branch.
id="t-329000"&&You can have no budgets, no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level.
id="t-335000"&&And everybody can do it.
id="t-337000"&&You just need inspiration, vision and determination.
id="t-341000"&&And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. 

id="t-345000"&&Thank you.
