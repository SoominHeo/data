id="t-0"&&I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age.
id="t-6000"&&I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually. 

id="t-9000"&&The first one is dedicated to Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.
id="t-17000"&&My poem is called "Dirt."

id="t-20000"&&My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap; 

id="t-24000"&&half a long century gone 

id="t-26000"&&and still she comes at me 

id="t-28000"&&with that thick cruel yellow bar. 

id="t-31000"&&All because of a word I said, 

id="t-34000"&&not even said really, only repeated. 

id="t-37000"&&But "Open," she says, "open up!"

id="t-39000"&&her hand clawing at my head. 

id="t-43000"&&I know now her life was hard; 

id="t-45000"&&she lost three children as babies, 

id="t-48000"&&then her husband died too, 

id="t-50000"&&leaving young sons, and no money. 

id="t-53000"&&She'd stand me in the sink to pee 

id="t-55000"&&because there was never room in the toilet. 

id="t-58000"&&But oh, her soap! 

id="t-60000"&&Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet? 

id="t-65000"&&The street she lived on was unpaved, 

id="t-68000"&&her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen 

id="t-71000"&&where she stalked and caught me. 

id="t-74000"&&Dare I admit that after she did it 

id="t-77000"&&I never really loved her again? 

id="t-80000"&&She lived to a hundred, 

even then.
even then.

id="t-87000"&&but I never, until now 

id="t-89000"&&loved her again. 

id="t-93000"&&When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle.
id="t-99000"&&"You have maligned a great woman."
id="t-105000"&&It took some diplomacy. 

id="t-111000"&&This is called "The Dress."
id="t-113000"&&It's a longer poem. 

id="t-115000"&&In those days, 

id="t-117000"&&those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now, 

id="t-122000"&&when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong, 

id="t-127000"&&then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block, 

id="t-133000"&&and the last sound at night as likely as not 

id="t-136000"&&would be your father pulling up in his car, 

id="t-139000"&&having worked late again, always late, 

id="t-142000"&&and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace, 

id="t-145000"&&to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- 

id="t-152000"&&in those long-ago days, 

id="t-154000"&&women, my mother, my friends' mothers, our neighbors, all the women I knew -- 

id="t-160000"&&wore, often much of the day, what were called housedresses, 

id="t-164000"&&cheap, printed, pulpy, seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown 

id="t-172000"&&and, when you had to go look for a child, hang wash on the line, or run down to the grocery store on the corner, 

id="t-180000"&&under a coat, the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed, dangling beneath. 

id="t-189000"&&More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- 

id="t-196000"&&a ball, one would think -- that never came to pass; 

id="t-200000"&&more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day, 

id="t-205000"&&but seemed scraped, bleached, and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike; 

id="t-211000"&&more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding, 

id="t-218000"&&adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access, and boys no conception. 

id="t-226000"&&Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation: 

id="t-231000"&&that in your dim kitchen, your laundry, your bleak concrete yard, 

id="t-237000"&&what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation; 

id="t-241000"&&your real sensual nature, veiled in those sexless vestments, was utterly your dominion. 

id="t-115000"&&In those days, one hid much else as well: 

id="t-253000"&&grown men didn't embrace one another, unless someone had died, and not always then; you shook hands 

id="t-260000"&&or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; 

id="t-267000"&&once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, 

id="t-273000"&&not until mores at last had evolved, and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, 

id="t-280000"&&then even kiss (your fathers bristles white and stiff now). 

id="t-286000"&&What release finally, the embrace: though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious -- 

id="t-293000"&&how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion, 

id="t-298000"&&no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then. 

id="t-306000"&&We knew so little in those days, as little as now, I suppose about healing those hurts: 

id="t-313000"&&even the women, in their best dresses, with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices, 

id="t-319000"&&even in lipstick and mascara, their hair aflow, could only stand wringing their hands, begging for peace, 

id="t-327000"&&while father and son, like thugs, like thieves, like Romans, simmered and hissed and hated, 

id="t-334000"&&inflicting sorrows that endured, the worst anyway, through the kiss and embrace, 

id="t-341000"&&bleeding from brother to brother, into the generations. 

id="t-346000"&&In those days there was still countryside close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows; 

id="t-353000"&&even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway 

id="t-358000"&&you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests. 

id="t-365000"&&Or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot, 

id="t-370000"&&into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk, 

id="t-374000"&&crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone; 

id="t-379000"&&already there was wanting to be simpler, wanting, when they called you, 

id="t-386000"&&never to go back. 

id="t-390000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-401000"&&This is another longish one, about the old and the young.
id="t-406000"&&It actually happened right at the time we met.
id="t-408000"&&Part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared. 

id="t-415000"&&It's called "The Neighbor."

id="t-417000"&&Her five horrid, deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window. 

id="t-425000"&&Her cats, God knows how many, who must piss on her rugs -- her landing's a sickening reek. 

id="t-432000"&&Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door, then the door slamming fearfully shut, 

id="t-439000"&&only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does, day and night into the hall. 

id="t-447000"&&The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" -- 

id="t-450000"&&how it brought back my college sweetheart, 

id="t-453000"&&my first real love, who -- till I left her -- played the same record. 

id="t-459000"&&And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh, 

id="t-463000"&&sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions she was too young for, 

id="t-469000"&&as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain. 

id="t-473000"&&It startled, then bored, then repelled me. 

id="t-478000"&&My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap in the Village, that my neighbor was her. 

id="t-484000"&&My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another, become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance. 

id="t-491000"&&My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox. 

id="t-496000"&&Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown, 

id="t-500000"&&her turning away, hiding her ravaged face in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."

id="t-508000"&&Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell. 

A man shouting, "Shut up!"
A man shouting, "Shut up!"

id="t-516000"&&claws scrabbling, then her -- her voice hoarse, harsh, hollow, almost only a tone, 

id="t-523000"&&incoherent, a note, a squawk, bone on metal, metal gone molten, 

id="t-528000"&&calling them back, "Come back darlings, come back dear ones.
id="t-533000"&&My sweet angels, come back."

id="t-537000"&&Medea she was, next time I saw her. 

id="t-540000"&&Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic, stock-still on the sidewalk 

id="t-545000"&&ragged coat hanging agape, passersby flowing around her, 

id="t-550000"&&her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream, 

id="t-554000"&&silently though, as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted. 

id="t-559000"&&A cry so pure, practiced, detached, it had no need of a voice, or could no longer bear one. 

id="t-568000"&&These invisible links that allure, these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us. 

id="t-576000"&&The girl, my old love, the last lost time I saw her 

id="t-580000"&&when she came to find me at a party, 

id="t-583000"&&her drunkenly stumbling, falling, sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red, swollen with tears, her shame, her dishonor. 

id="t-594000"&&My ignorant, arrogant coarseness, my secret pride, my turning away. 

id="t-601000"&&Still life on a rooftop, dead trees in barrels, a bench broken, dogs, excrement, sky. 

id="t-609000"&&What pathways through pain, what junctures of vulnerability, what crossings and counterings? 

id="t-616000"&&Too many lives in our lives already, too many chances for sorrow, too many unaccounted-for pasts. 

id="t-624000"&&"Behold me," the god of frenzied, inexhaustible love says, rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."

id="t-634000"&&Her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs, one agonized step at a time. 

id="t-641000"&&My holding the door. 

id="t-643000"&&Her crossing the fragmented tiles, faltering at the step to the street, 

id="t-648000"&&droning, not looking at me, "Can you help me?"

id="t-652000"&&Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.
id="t-656000"&&Her wavering step into the world. 

Her whispering, "Thanks love."
Her whispering, "Thanks love."

id="t-390000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-677000"&&I think I'll lighten up a little.
id="t-679000"&&(Laughter) Another, different kind of poem of youth and age. 

id="t-685000"&&It's called "Gas."

id="t-679000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-689000"&&Wouldn't it be nice, I think, 

id="t-691000"&&when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table 

id="t-697000"&&and farts, just a little, and violently blushes. 

id="t-702000"&&Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds, 

id="t-707000"&&so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face 

id="t-712000"&&before it drifted away. 

id="t-679000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-716000"&&Besides, for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence.
id="t-716000"&&Besides, for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence.

id="t-723000"&&my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. 

id="t-728000"&&And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was 12, 

id="t-732000"&&and a splendid piebald stallion, 

id="t-735000"&&who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that, though more hugely of course, enormous, gleaming, resplendent. 

id="t-743000"&&And the woman, her face abashedly buried in her "Elle" now, reminded me -- 

id="t-748000"&&I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took 

id="t-755000"&&the horse would powerfully fart. 

Phwap!
Phwap!
Phwap!

id="t-759000"&&Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days. 

id="t-766000"&&All that savage grandeur, the steely glinting hooves, the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards, 

id="t-775000"&&breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared, 

id="t-780000"&&I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him. 

id="t-679000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-390000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-797000"&&This is called "Thirst."
id="t-802000"&&Many -- most of my poems actually are urban poems.
id="t-802000"&&Many -- most of my poems actually are urban poems.

id="t-808000"&&"Thirst."

id="t-810000"&&Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter, 

id="t-814000"&&day and night, on a bench in the 103rd Street subway station, until finally one day she vanished. 

id="t-822000"&&We regarded each other, scrutinized one another. 

id="t-826000"&&Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive. 

id="t-830000"&&She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously, wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty. 

I was frightened of her.
I was frightened of her.

id="t-842000"&&I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped 

id="t-848000"&&in the shocking seethe of her stench. 

id="t-852000"&&Not excrement merely, not merely surface and orifice going unwashed, rediffusion of rum, 

id="t-859000"&&there was will in it, and intention, power and purpose -- a social, ethical rage and rebellion -- 

id="t-867000"&&despair too, though, grief, loss. 

id="t-872000"&&Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me, bathe her, comfort her, dress her. 

id="t-877000"&&She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.
id="t-880000"&&Instead, I'd step into my train. 

id="t-883000"&&How rich I would think, is the lexicon of our self-absolving. 

id="t-888000"&&How enduring, our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. 

id="t-896000"&&The dance of our glances, the clash, pulling each other through our perceptual punctures, 

id="t-903000"&&then holocaust, holocaust, host on host of ill, injured presences, squandered, consumed. 

id="t-913000"&&Her vigil somewhere I know continues. 

id="t-916000"&&Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance. 

id="t-896000"&&The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication, effacement, the perfume of our consternation. 

id="t-390000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-940000"&&This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.
id="t-944000"&&The title is "This Happened."

id="t-947000"&&A student, a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee, 

id="t-953000"&&perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes; 

id="t-959000"&&a teacher passes and chides her, "Be careful, you might fall," almost banteringly chides her, 

id="t-966000"&&"You might fall," 

id="t-968000"&&and the young woman, 18, a girl really, 

id="t-971000"&&though she wouldn't think that, as brilliant as she is, first in her class, and "Beautiful, too," she's often told, 

id="t-979000"&&smiles back, and leans into the open window, which wouldn't even be open if it were winter -- 

if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!")
if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!")

id="t-990000"&&leans into the window, farther, still smiling, 

id="t-994000"&&farther and farther, though it takes less time than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall. 

id="t-1002000"&&Herself fall. 

id="t-1005000"&&A casual impulse, a fancy, never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ... 

id="t-1012000"&&No, more than impulse or fancy, the girl knows what she's doing, 

id="t-1017000"&&the girl means something, the girl means to mean, 

id="t-1021000"&&because it occurs to her in that instant, that beautiful or not, bright yes or no, she's not who she is, 

id="t-1029000"&&she's not the person she is, 

id="t-1031000"&&and the reason, she suddenly knows, is that there's been so much premeditation 

id="t-1036000"&&where she is, so much plotting and planning, 

id="t-1039000"&&there's hardly a person where she is, or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her, 

id="t-1046000"&&it's a self inhabited, lived in by her, 

id="t-1050000"&&and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing: 

id="t-1054000"&&grace, 

id="t-1056000"&&not premeditation but grace, a kind of being in the world spontaneously, with grace. 

id="t-1064000"&&Weightfully upon me was the world. 

id="t-1067000"&&Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself. 

id="t-1073000"&&Weightfully this self which weighed upon me, the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve. 

id="t-1081000"&&And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant already now so many times divided, 

id="t-1088000"&&the sadness she felt once, hardly knowing she felt it, 

id="t-1092000"&&to merely inhabit herself. 

id="t-1094000"&&Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall, 

id="t-1097000"&&even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd, 

id="t-1105000"&&yet the girl falling isn't myself, or she is myself, but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.
id="t-1105000"&&yet the girl falling isn't myself, or she is myself, but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.
id="t-1105000"&&yet the girl falling isn't myself, or she is myself, but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.

id="t-1118000"&&This happened. 

id="t-390000"&&(Applause) 

I'll read just one more.
I'll read just one more.
id="t-1131000"&&I like to just end.
id="t-1133000"&&But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me. 

id="t-1140000"&&This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough. 

id="t-1144000"&&"Special: big tits," 

id="t-1146000"&&Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand. 

id="t-1151000"&&But forget her breasts. 

id="t-1153000"&&A lush, fresh-lipped blond, skin glowing gold, sprawls there, resplendent. 

id="t-1161000"&&60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible, hardly better than harlots, can still stir me. 

id="t-1169000"&&Maybe a coming of age in the American sensual darkness, 

id="t-1173000"&&never seeing an unsmudged nipple, an uncensored vagina, 

id="t-1177000"&&has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye. 

id="t-1183000"&&Always that erotic murmur, 

id="t-1185000"&&I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. 

id="t-1191000"&&God knows though, there are worse twists your obsessions can take. 

id="t-1196000"&&Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah 

id="t-1204000"&&forbade them to look in one room.
id="t-1207000"&&Because there were images in it he said were licentious. 

The display was a photo.
The display was a photo.

id="t-1215000"&&some trying to cover their genitals, others too frightened to bother, 

id="t-1219000"&&lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch. 

id="t-1224000"&&The girls, to my horror, averted their gaze. 

id="t-1229000"&&What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. 

Even that though.
Even that though.

id="t-1237000"&&Once in a book on pre-war Poland, 

id="t-1240000"&&a studio portrait, an absolute angel, an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes. 

id="t-1246000"&&I kept finding myself at her page. 

id="t-1249000"&&That she died in the camps made her -- I didn't dare wonder why -- 

id="t-1255000"&&more present, more precious. 

id="t-1258000"&&Died in the camps, that too people -- or Jews anyway -- kept from their children back then. 

id="t-1265000"&&But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told. 

id="t-1269000"&&Sex and death, how close they can seem. 

id="t-1273000"&&So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me, sometimes I think I confound them. 

id="t-1280000"&&My wife's loveliness almost consumes me. 

id="t-1283000"&&My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. 

id="t-1286000"&&When we make love, her holding me everywhere all around me, I'm there and not there. 

id="t-1293000"&&My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions, 

id="t-1297000"&&I live my life over, as though I were drowning. 

id="t-1302000"&&Then I am drowning, in despair at having to leave her, this, everything, all, unbearable, awful. 

id="t-1312000"&&Still, to be able to die with no special contrition, not having been slaughtered, or enslaved. 

id="t-1320000"&&And not having to know history's next mad rage or regression, it might be a relief. 

No.
No.
id="t-1330000"&&I don't mean that for a moment. 

id="t-1332000"&&What I mean is the world holds me so tightly -- the good and the bad -- 

id="t-1337000"&&my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus 

id="t-1342000"&&with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped with gel, so moves me 

id="t-1348000"&&my breath catches.
id="t-1348000"&&my breath catches.
id="t-1348000"&&my breath catches.
id="t-1348000"&&my breath catches.

id="t-1353000"&&How much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows. 

id="t-1358000"&&How she incarnates our desperate human need for regard, 

id="t-1363000"&&our passion to live in beauty, to be beauty, to be cherished by glances, 

id="t-1370000"&&if by no more, of something like love, 

id="t-1374000"&&or love. 

id="t-1376000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-390000"&&(Applause)
