id="t-0"&&I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.
id="t-2000"&&I review gadgets and stuff.
id="t-4000"&&And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.
id="t-11000"&&What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question: "What are the tech trends for next year?"
id="t-19000"&&And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"

id="t-22000"&&But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.
id="t-28000"&&You know, I found that volcano on Google Images, not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-38000"&&Anyway, this all started a few years ago, when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line, and we've come a long way since that.

id="t-50000"&&Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
id="t-55000"&&Now, it works just like a regular phone.
id="t-57000"&&So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone, but its just a fake-out.
id="t-57000"&&So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone, but its just a fake-out.

id="t-57000"&&So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone, but its just a fake-out.
id="t-72000"&&The little box has your phone number.
id="t-74000"&&So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia, and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring, because it's got everything in the box.
id="t-83000"&&They've got every feature known to man in there, because adding a new feature is just software. 

id="t-88000"&&And as a result of Voice Over IP -- I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet -- land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.
id="t-98000"&&I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
id="t-98000"&&I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
id="t-98000"&&I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
id="t-107000"&&It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC, and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.
id="t-115000"&&It's not your phone -- it's your computer.
id="t-119000"&&But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money, believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone. 

id="t-124000"&&It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me, try out Skype for the first time, which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.
id="t-132000"&&They don't want to pay the international fees, so they're like, "Timmy!
id="t-132000"&&They don't want to pay the international fees, so they're like, "Timmy!

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-139000"&&It's really cute.
id="t-142000"&&But I -- at least it was when I did it -- 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-145000"&&I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones.
id="t-149000"&&Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone, and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world, never pay the cellular company a nickel.
id="t-159000"&&It'd be really, really cool -- and yet, even though the technology for this has been available for five years, incredibly, the number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero!
id="t-174000"&&I can't figure out why! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

Actually, I need to update that.
Actually, I need to update that.
id="t-181000"&&And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.
id="t-184000"&&It comes from T-Mobile.
id="t-186000"&&And I am not paid by T-Mobile.
id="t-188000"&&I'm not plugging T-Mobile.
id="t-190000"&&The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
id="t-193000"&&Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-198000"&&Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June 29.
id="t-204000"&&Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
id="t-204000"&&Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
id="t-204000"&&Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
id="t-210000"&&I'm like, can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady?
id="t-210000"&&I'm like, can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady?

id="t-215000"&&"Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!"

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

But it's actually really, really cool.
But it's actually really, really cool.
id="t-233000"&&The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot, all your calls are free.
id="t-238000"&&And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.
id="t-241000"&&You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"
id="t-243000"&&The answer is, "All the time!"
id="t-245000"&&Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone, for your house.
id="t-251000"&&Which is really ingenious, because we all know that T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.
id="t-255000"&&They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.
id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers.
id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers.
id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers.
id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers.
id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers.
id="t-271000"&&We're putting it in our homes for them! 

id="t-275000"&&Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.
id="t-278000"&&But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range, the call is handed off in mid-syllable, seamlessly.
id="t-278000"&&But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range, the call is handed off in mid-syllable, seamlessly.
id="t-294000"&&This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-299000"&&As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife -- look at the upper left.
id="t-299000"&&As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife -- look at the upper left.

id="t-307000"&&(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello? 

id="t-308000"&&David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me. 

id="t-310000"&&JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you? 

DP: You're on Wi-Fi.
DP: You're on Wi-Fi.

id="t-315000"&&JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good. 

Now, I'm leaving the house.
Now, I'm leaving the house.

JP: No not at all.
JP: No not at all.

id="t-323000"&&DP: What are you guys doing? 

id="t-325000"&&Right there!
id="t-327000"&&It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.
id="t-327000"&&It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.
id="t-327000"&&It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-337000"&&The bottom line is that the boundaries, because of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.
id="t-341000"&&The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced, the billing technology has not caught up.
id="t-350000"&&So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot, you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead -- which would be like 10 minutes -- 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-362000"&&And the call will continue to be free.
id="t-364000"&&Because they don't, they haven't -- well, no, wait!
id="t-364000"&&Because they don't, they haven't -- well, no, wait!
id="t-368000"&&It also works the other way.
id="t-370000"&&So if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home, you keep being billed.
id="t-374000"&&Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying, "Hey, I just got home.
id="t-374000"&&Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying, "Hey, I just got home.
id="t-380000"&&Now you get it.
id="t-382000"&&It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas, it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.
id="t-388000"&&On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog, right?
id="t-388000"&&On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog, right?
id="t-393000"&&You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones.
id="t-393000"&&You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones.

id="t-398000"&&This is another favorite of mine.
id="t-400000"&&Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
id="t-400000"&&Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
id="t-400000"&&Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
id="t-414000"&&And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-418000"&&I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.
id="t-421000"&&I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

All right!
All right!

All right!

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-464000"&&So this is Grand Central at work -- it's a -- oh, for gods sake! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-471000"&&I have your numbers now! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-475000"&&You will pay. 

id="t-477000"&&Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number, and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.
id="t-486000"&&Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone (this is the EG crowd). 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-493000"&&The beauty of that is you never miss a call.
id="t-495000"&&I know a lot of you are like, "Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."
id="t-499000"&&But the beauty is it's all going through the internet, so you get all of these really cool features -- like you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.
id="t-507000"&&And I want these people to hear this greeting, "Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money.
id="t-507000"&&And I want these people to hear this greeting, "Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money.
id="t-513000"&&And then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."
id="t-516000"&&Very, very customizable.
id="t-519000"&&Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.
id="t-523000"&&They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method. 

id="t-526000"&&By the way, this is something that really bothers me.
id="t-526000"&&By the way, this is something that really bothers me.

id="t-537000"&&I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.
id="t-540000"&&I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.
id="t-542000"&&What you're going to use is Google Cellular.
id="t-544000"&&It's totally free -- there's not even ads.
id="t-547000"&&If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
id="t-547000"&&If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
id="t-547000"&&If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
id="t-552000"&&You send a text message to the word "Google," which turns out to be 46645.
id="t-557000"&&Leave off the last "e" for savings. 

id="t-560000"&&Anyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.
id="t-562000"&&You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.
id="t-564000"&&You hit send, and in five seconds, they will send you back the two closest drugstores, complete with name address and phone number.
id="t-574000"&&Here it comes.
id="t-576000"&&And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving, you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."

id="t-581000"&&It works with weather, too.
id="t-583000"&&You can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.
id="t-585000"&&And then in five seconds, they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town.
id="t-591000"&&Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
id="t-591000"&&Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
id="t-591000"&&Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
id="t-596000"&&These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will -- yeah!

id="t-613000"&&So I'm going to teach you something even better.
id="t-615000"&&This is called Google Info.
id="t-617000"&&They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.
id="t-619000"&&It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.
id="t-622000"&&So lets say I'm in Monterey, and I want what?

id="t-629000"&&Google: Say the business and the city and state. 

id="t-633000"&&DP: Bagels, Monterey, California.
id="t-639000"&&I got the Chinese line. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-643000"&&Google: Bagels, Monterey, California.
id="t-645000"&&Top eight results: Number one, Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.

id="t-688000"&&Google: Hold on. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-692000"&&DP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?
id="t-694000"&&No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.
id="t-697000"&&So anyway, you never even find out the number.
id="t-701000"&&It's just so amazing.
id="t-703000"&&And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
id="t-703000"&&And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
id="t-703000"&&And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
id="t-707000"&&This you can ask by voice any question.

id="t-715000"&&It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer.
id="t-718000"&&I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.
id="t-720000"&&"Which actors have played James Bond?"
id="t-722000"&&They text me back this: "Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."

id="t-722000"&&They text me back this: "Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."
id="t-729000"&&I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like, when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"
id="t-734000"&&Just to see how the recognition was.
id="t-736000"&&They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."
id="t-739000"&&Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976. 

id="t-743000"&&You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to make money doing this?"
id="t-743000"&&You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to make money doing this?"
id="t-748000"&&They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.
id="t-751000"&&And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
id="t-751000"&&And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
id="t-751000"&&And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
id="t-758000"&&Because there is one!
id="t-760000"&&They have 10,000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer.
id="t-765000"&&As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.
id="t-769000"&&That's who can afford to do that.
id="t-769000"&&That's who can afford to do that.
id="t-769000"&&That's who can afford to do that.
id="t-769000"&&That's who can afford to do that.
id="t-769000"&&That's who can afford to do that.

id="t-780000"&&Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today -- this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.
id="t-787000"&&When I call to leave you a message, I get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on Ambien! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-800000"&&"To page this person ... " Page?
id="t-800000"&&"To page this person ... " Page?
id="t-806000"&&Nobody has pagers anymore.
id="t-808000"&&"You may begin speaking at the tone.
id="t-811000"&&When you have finished recording, you may hang up."
id="t-811000"&&When you have finished recording, you may hang up."

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-821000"&&And then it gets worse: when I call to retrieve my messages, first of all: "You have 87 messages.
id="t-831000"&&To listen to your messages ... " Why else am I calling? 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-837000"&&Of course I want to listen to the messages! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

Oh!
Oh!
id="t-846000"&&So last year I went to Milan, Italy, and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.
id="t-855000"&&And I said as a joke -- as a joke, I said, "I did the math.

id="t-861000"&&If you check your voicemail twice a day, that's 100 million dollars a year.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

Where is the outrage, people?

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

Sorry.
Sorry.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-893000"&&So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.
id="t-895000"&&There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text.
id="t-900000"&&And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone.
id="t-905000"&&It is a life-changer.
id="t-907000"&&And by the way, they don't always get the words right, because it's over the phone and all that.
id="t-910000"&&So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double-check.
id="t-915000"&&The services are called things like Spinvox, Phonetag -- this is the one I use -- Callwave.
id="t-915000"&&The services are called things like Spinvox, Phonetag -- this is the one I use -- Callwave.
id="t-921000"&&I don't really want people listening in to my calls."
id="t-924000"&&The executives at these companies told me, "Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.
id="t-931000"&&I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in. 

id="t-936000"&&The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services, I got two voicemail messages.
id="t-936000"&&The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services, I got two voicemail messages.
id="t-946000"&&The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh, with the silent 'h'.
id="t-946000"&&The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh, with the silent 'h'.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-960000"&&So you be the judge. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-964000"&&Anyway, this service, Callwave, promises that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages.
id="t-969000"&&And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-978000"&&So I thought I'd see how that goes.
id="t-980000"&&This is me testing it out. 

id="t-983000"&&(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
id="t-983000"&&(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
id="t-983000"&&(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
id="t-983000"&&(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
id="t-989000"&&Hey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.
id="t-994000"&&And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.
id="t-1000000"&&I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.
id="t-1003000"&&She's in room -- emergency room 53W.
id="t-1008000"&&OK, talk to you later -- bye. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1016000"&&I love my job. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1019000"&&So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
id="t-1019000"&&So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
id="t-1019000"&&So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
id="t-1019000"&&So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
id="t-1028000"&&So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
id="t-1028000"&&So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
id="t-1028000"&&So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?

id="t-1035000"&&"Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"! 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1044000"&&What the f -- ? 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1049000"&&Well I guess that was the gist. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1054000"&&And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
id="t-1054000"&&And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
id="t-1054000"&&And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
id="t-1059000"&&Basically, you're going to go on some iffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.
id="t-1064000"&&So you go and you type in your phone number, and at the exact minute where you want to be called -- 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1072000"&&And at that moment your phone will ring.
id="t-1072000"&&And at that moment your phone will ring.
id="t-1072000"&&And at that moment your phone will ring.
id="t-1076000"&&The really beautiful thing is, you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller.
id="t-1083000"&&So they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end.
id="t-1088000"&&Here's the girlfriend. 

id="t-1090000"&&Phone: Hey you, what's going on? 

id="t-1092000"&&DP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now. 

id="t-1094000"&&Phone: Well, that's good. 

id="t-1096000"&&DP: What are you doing? 

id="t-1097000"&&Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to. 

id="t-1099000"&&DP: Right, I can't really talk right now.
id="t-1102000"&&This is the -- I love this -- the boss call. 

id="t-1104000"&&Phone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office. 

id="t-1107000"&&DP: Oh, hi, sir. 

Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago?
Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago?

id="t-1111000"&&DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot. 

id="t-1114000"&&Phone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier? 

id="t-1118000"&&DP: It was like three weeks ago. 

id="t-1120000"&&Phone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but -- 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1128000"&&I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone.
id="t-1132000"&&Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism.
id="t-1134000"&&It was when in the fall of 2006, I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

I looked like a moron.
I looked like a moron.
id="t-1154000"&&I know the people who worked on the Treo.
id="t-1156000"&&They went around to these carriers and said, 

"Look at these cool features."
"Look at these cool features."
id="t-1161000"&&I don't think so."
id="t-1163000"&&It was not very conducive to innovation.
id="t-1167000"&&What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace -- and you won't even see it till it's done."
id="t-1177000"&&Actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.
id="t-1180000"&&Finally Cingular said OK. 

id="t-1183000"&&I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.
id="t-1185000"&&Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you?
id="t-1185000"&&Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you?
id="t-1185000"&&Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you?

id="t-1185000"&&Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you?

But it did change a few things.
But it did change a few things.
id="t-1205000"&&And they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.
id="t-1207000"&&Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones."

id="t-1211000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1215000"&&Another thing was that it let 10 million people, for the first time, experience being online all the time.
id="t-1221000"&&Not using these 60-dollar-a-month cellular cards for their laptops.
id="t-1226000"&&I don't understand why we're not there yet.
id="t-1228000"&&When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren, "When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email, I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop.
id="t-1228000"&&When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren, "When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email, I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop.

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1244000"&&"We had wireless base stations that could broadcast -- yay, about 150 feet across."

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

It's absurd.
It's absurd.
It's absurd.
id="t-1254000"&&What's the problem?
id="t-1256000"&&Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.
id="t-1259000"&&You have to go to YouTube and type in "iPhone Shuffle."
id="t-1263000"&&This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.
id="t-1268000"&&It's like, "It only has one button.
id="t-1271000"&&Touch it and it dials a number at random."

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1275000"&&"Who the hell is this?"

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1278000"&&But the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store.
id="t-1282000"&&It downloads right to the phone.
id="t-1285000"&&And you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car using this game.
id="t-1290000"&&These programs can use all the components of the iPhone -- the touch screen.
id="t-1295000"&&This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008.
id="t-1297000"&&You know how you erase it?
id="t-1297000"&&You know how you erase it?
id="t-1297000"&&You know how you erase it?
id="t-1297000"&&You know how you erase it?
id="t-1297000"&&You know how you erase it?

id="t-1304000"&&They have 10,000 of these programs.
id="t-1304000"&&They have 10,000 of these programs.
id="t-1304000"&&They have 10,000 of these programs.
id="t-1309000"&&You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
id="t-1309000"&&You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
id="t-1309000"&&You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
id="t-1317000"&&A song is running through your head -- you sing it into the thing: do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ... OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.

This is Pandora.

This is Pandora.
id="t-1345000"&&It will immediately play you that song or that band.
id="t-1348000"&&It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
id="t-1350000"&&You say if you like this song or not.
id="t-1353000"&&If you like it, it tries another song on you from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals, theme and tempo.
id="t-1360000"&&If you like that one, or don't like it, you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down.
id="t-1360000"&&If you like that one, or don't like it, you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down.
id="t-1369000"&&It eventually only plays songs you like. 

This is Urbanspoon.
This is Urbanspoon.
This is Urbanspoon.
This is Urbanspoon.
This is Urbanspoon.
id="t-1377000"&&It proposes a restaurant.
id="t-1380000"&&It gives you the price, and the location and ratings.
id="t-1384000"&&Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.
id="t-1389000"&&Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.
id="t-1391000"&&Of course, its not just about the iPhone. 

id="t-1393000"&&The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
id="t-1393000"&&The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
id="t-1393000"&&The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
id="t-1402000"&&Touch screen -- very, very nice.
id="t-1404000"&&Also with its own app store, where you can download programs. 

This is amazing.

id="t-1418000"&&I love the Wired headline: Pigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No.

So everything is changing.

So everything is changing.
So everything is changing.

id="t-1211000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1444000"&&Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.
id="t-1448000"&&It's only three pounds, or 12 if you install Microsoft Office. 

id="t-35000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1455000"&&Sorry, that was mean.
id="t-1458000"&&This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.
id="t-1461000"&&Ladies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on YouTube.
id="t-1467537"&&(To the tune of "My Way") 

id="t-1468883"&&And now the end is near.
id="t-1473000"&&I'm sick to death of this old cell phone.
id="t-1478000"&&Bad sound, the signal's weak, the software stinks.
id="t-1483000"&&A made-in-Hell phone.
id="t-1486000"&&I've heard there's something new -- a million times more rad than my phone.
id="t-1494000"&&I too will join the cult.
id="t-1498000"&&I want an iPhone.
id="t-1498000"&&I want an iPhone.
id="t-1498000"&&I want an iPhone.
id="t-1511000"&&No keys, no memory card, the battery's sealed -- you can't replace it.
id="t-1519000"&&But God, this thing is sweet.
id="t-1522000"&&A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.
id="t-1527000"&&You had me from, "Hello."
id="t-1498000"&&I want an iPhone.

id="t-1539000"&&I want to wipe the smudges clean.
id="t-1543000"&&I want my friends to look and drool.
id="t-1547000"&&I want to say, "Look -- now I'm cool" I stood in line and I'll get mine.

id="t-1567000"&&It's all the things a phone should be.
id="t-1570000"&&Who cares if it's AT&amp;T?
id="t-1574000"&&I took a stand, paid half a grand!
id="t-1580000"&&And I got an iPhone!
