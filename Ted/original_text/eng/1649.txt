id="t-0"&&I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin, and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.
id="t-8000"&&Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic, and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you. 

id="t-17000"&&"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it.
id="t-33000"&&This proposition will be found on careful examination to express, in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory, and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning; who, by a strange inversion of reasoning, seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."

Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.

id="t-82000"&&If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."

A-ha!
A-ha!
id="t-93000"&&You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer.
id="t-101000"&&But Darwin shows that it’s just false. 

id="t-103000"&&Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion, which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
id="t-114000"&&It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
id="t-121000"&&Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.
id="t-127000"&&We adore babies because they’re so cute.
id="t-131000"&&And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. 

This is all backwards.
This is all backwards.
This is all backwards.
This is all backwards.
This is all backwards.
id="t-164000"&&Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."
id="t-171000"&&There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
id="t-176000"&&If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind, you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.
id="t-183000"&&You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.
id="t-189000"&&So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong.
id="t-189000"&&So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong.
id="t-197000"&&Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. 

id="t-201000"&&And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.
id="t-205000"&&And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were, then Mother Nature would have a problem: How on earth do you get chimps to mate?
id="t-221000"&&Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.
id="t-229000"&&That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.
id="t-233000"&&Just wire the chimps up to love that look, and apparently they do.
id="t-239000"&&That’s all there is to it.
id="t-244000"&&Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.
id="t-248000"&&We became bald-bodied, oddly enough; for one reason or another, they didn’t.
id="t-255000"&&If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness. 

id="t-267000"&&Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.
id="t-272000"&&It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.
id="t-275000"&&Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
id="t-278000"&&The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen, who did his famous experiments with gulls, where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak -- if he made a bigger, oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.
id="t-290000"&&It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.
id="t-293000"&&What we see with, say, chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.
id="t-302000"&&And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.
id="t-305000"&&There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. 

And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness.
And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness.
id="t-314000"&&It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.
id="t-319000"&&So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.
id="t-325000"&&And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.
id="t-332000"&&So nature works on many levels here.
id="t-335000"&&But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this, that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find -- we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.
id="t-350000"&&This is the strange inversion. 

Well now, finally what about funny.

id="t-363000"&&And I won’t be able to say too much about it.
id="t-365000"&&But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done -- it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.
id="t-382000"&&Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.
id="t-386000"&&It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job.
id="t-396000"&&Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging.
id="t-403000"&&Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out, but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.
id="t-410000"&&And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke -- now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ... now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny -- in this way, we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain, the functional architecture of the brain.
