id="t-0"&&Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.
id="t-190000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-6000"&&(Music) 

id="t-190000"&&(Applause) 

Thank you!
id="t-190000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-203000"&&I took my shoes off to dance, but maybe I'll get at that later.
id="t-208000"&&Anyways, I... where to start?
id="t-212000"&&Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton.
id="t-265000"&&The traditional language is Gaelic, but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language, and the dancing and the singing and everything, and my bloodline is Scottish through and through, but my mother and father are two very, very musical people. 

id="t-285000"&&My mom taught me to dance when I was five, and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.
id="t-294000"&&My uncle is a very well-known Cape Breton fiddler.
id="t-298000"&&His name's Buddy MacMaster, and just a wonderful guy, and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing, and we had parties, great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses, and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
id="t-315000"&&Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music. 

id="t-365000"&&I've recorded lots of CDs.
id="t-367000"&&I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy.
id="t-190000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-190000"&&(Applause) 

Donnell Leahy: Thank you.
Donnell Leahy: Thank you.
id="t-421000"&&So I asked Natalie, what do I do?
id="t-423000"&&And she said, just talk about yourself. 

id="t-425000"&&It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family.
id="t-425000"&&It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family.
id="t-437000"&&Mom and Dad raised beef cattle, and I'm the oldest boy.
id="t-444000"&&There are four girls a little bit older than me.
id="t-446000"&&We grew up without a television.
id="t-448000"&&People find that strange, but I think it was a great blessing for us.
id="t-453000"&&We had a television for a few years, but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done, so out went the television. 

id="t-463000"&&We grew up playing— Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.
id="t-468000"&&Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other.
id="t-468000"&&Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other.
id="t-474000"&&(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of, we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music. 

id="t-485000"&&We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio.
id="t-485000"&&We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio.
id="t-519000"&&Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.

id="t-663000"&&(Laughter) 

NM: You want to or no?
id="t-663000"&&(Laughter) Well I guess I have to now.
id="t-572000"&&Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying — Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids.

id="t-620000"&&Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married, but anyway, so, then I got a phone call about, I dunno, seven years later.

id="t-643000"&&And I said, "I know you.
id="t-645000"&&I have a tape of yours at home."
id="t-647000"&&And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper.
id="t-647000"&&And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper.

id="t-663000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) 

id="t-673000"&&DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it.
id="t-679000"&&I'm going to play a piece of music for you.
id="t-682000"&&It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
id="t-685000"&&I starts out with a slow air.
id="t-687000"&&Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player.
id="t-698000"&&I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway.

id="t-1004000"&&NM: Well, we're gonna play one together now.
id="t-190000"&&(Applause) We're laughing, like, because our styles are totally different, as you can hear.
id="t-1016000"&&And so, you know, Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play, but we don't have any of those ready.

id="t-1227000"&&NM: Uh, sure.

id="t-1301000"&&The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome.

id="t-1308000"&&My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton.
id="t-1308000"&&My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton.
id="t-1337000"&&It became the only piano in the region, and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived, she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms.

id="t-1352000"&&It had gone through, like, five or six families, and it was just a big thing for us, and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago.
id="t-1364000"&&Anyway, I'm blabbering on here. 

id="t-1366000"&&NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy. 

DL: What about Leahy?
id="t-663000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1371000"&&NM: Just tell them what— 

id="t-1374000"&&DL: She wants me to talk about— We have a band named Leahy.

id="t-1385000"&&NM: No surgeries. 

id="t-1387000"&&DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
id="t-1389000"&&We had a great opportunity.
id="t-1391000"&&We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.
id="t-1393000"&&It was a big thing for us, and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married, so we're staying close to home for, I guess, another couple of weeks.

id="t-1429000"&&DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument.

id="t-1467000"&&Sorry, I hate to carry on...
id="t-1469000"&&So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.
