id="t-0"&&So I understand that this meeting was planned, and the slogan was From Was to Still.
id="t-8000"&&And I am illustrating Still.
id="t-13000"&&Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because, although I am 94, I am not still working.
id="t-21000"&&And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"
id="t-27000"&&I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
id="t-27000"&&I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
id="t-27000"&&I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

I have my file which is called To Do.
I have my file which is called To Do.
I have my file which is called To Do.
I have my file which is called To Do.
id="t-61000"&&So this takes care of my age.
id="t-66000"&&I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.
id="t-73000"&&This was about 1925.
id="t-78000"&&All of these things were made during the last 75 years. 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-89000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-95000"&&But, of course, I'm working since 25, doing more or less what you see here.
id="t-95000"&&But, of course, I'm working since 25, doing more or less what you see here.
id="t-103000"&&This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
id="t-109000"&&This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
id="t-113000"&&This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
id="t-119000"&&This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. 

id="t-89000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-134000"&&These were just some of the things I've made.
id="t-138000"&&I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
id="t-143000"&&I call myself a maker of things.
id="t-147000"&&I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.
id="t-155000"&&Industrial designers want to make novel things.
id="t-160000"&&Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.
id="t-169000"&&The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."
id="t-177000"&&Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
id="t-187000"&&Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
id="t-187000"&&Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
id="t-187000"&&Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
id="t-205000"&&Well, to describe our profession otherwise, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.
id="t-216000"&&That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.
id="t-225000"&&Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote, "The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity -- that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty."
id="t-225000"&&Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote, "The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity -- that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty."
id="t-225000"&&Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote, "The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity -- that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty."

id="t-279000"&&So how can you, without drying up, make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?
id="t-291000"&&The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.
id="t-304000"&&Let me tell you some about my life.
id="t-309000"&&As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.
id="t-317000"&&My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 -- that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
id="t-345000"&&My work actually took me through many countries, and showed me a great part of the world.
id="t-356000"&&This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me -- I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.
id="t-368000"&&I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things, which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
id="t-383000"&&I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman, and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages. 

id="t-402000"&&The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice, I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.
id="t-416000"&&In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice, and I worked as the apprentice.
id="t-441000"&&The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
id="t-448000"&&That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
id="t-457000"&&We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
id="t-457000"&&We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
id="t-457000"&&We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
id="t-475000"&&And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
id="t-483000"&&And there I really worked as an apprentice.
id="t-487000"&&My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.
id="t-500000"&&And finally, I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully, that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters, Chimney Sweeps and Potters. 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-532000"&&I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.
id="t-544000"&&First I set up a shop in my own garden, and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
id="t-555000"&&And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend -- I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today -- but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
id="t-571000"&&My mother thought that this was not very proper, so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-586000"&&However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest, a pottery factory, a large one.
id="t-595000"&&And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
id="t-602000"&&Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?
id="t-606000"&&I said, I also have a pottery.
id="t-610000"&&So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did, and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism, that the industrial revolution had broken out, and that I rather should join the factory.
id="t-627000"&&There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
id="t-633000"&&However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
id="t-641000"&&The director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America. 

id="t-658000"&&I remember that it was quite successful.
id="t-662000"&&However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means, with my work -- than making toilets, so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory, saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.
id="t-691000"&&So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman, and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.
id="t-701000"&&So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
id="t-714000"&&And I got several answers, and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America. 

id="t-725000"&&And that was in Hamburg.
id="t-728000"&&Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel, and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.
id="t-746000"&&And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable -- there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting, was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
id="t-772000"&&So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice, and therefore he brought bread and butter every day, which I had to eat out of courtesy.
id="t-787000"&&The first day I came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me.
id="t-798000"&&My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.
id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very -- I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.
id="t-834000"&&This was my first job.
id="t-839000"&&If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight. 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-89000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-849000"&&So I will try speed it up a little 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-854000"&&Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes. 

id="t-40000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-861000"&&Eva Zeisel: Are you sure? 

id="t-864000"&&Moderator: Yes, I am sure. 

id="t-867000"&&EZ: Well, if you are sure, I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.
id="t-874000"&&And actually, my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity.
id="t-887000"&&And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union, where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.
id="t-902000"&&I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.
id="t-908000"&&I became art director of the china and glass industry, and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges, I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.
id="t-928000"&&So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges, and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.
id="t-941000"&&The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
id="t-949000"&&This was a very dangerous accusation.
id="t-955000"&&And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that I actually did survive, which was a surprise.
id="t-969000"&&But since I survived and I'm here, and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will -- 

id="t-976000"&&Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.
id="t-978000"&&Weren't you there recently? 

id="t-980000"&&EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact, the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.
id="t-995000"&&They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory, and they came to my studio in Rockland County, and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.
id="t-1012000"&&And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer, in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.
id="t-1023000"&&And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view.
id="t-1023000"&&And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view.
id="t-1023000"&&And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view.

id="t-89000"&&(Applause)
