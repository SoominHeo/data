id="t-896"&&So I'm a neurosurgeon.
id="t-3746"&&And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.
id="t-10549"&&I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident.
id="t-20045"&&And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair.
id="t-33211"&&And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap.
id="t-43203"&&And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon. 

id="t-49144"&&What is a functional neurosurgeon?
id="t-51978"&&It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies.
id="t-60066"&&You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function.
id="t-75330"&&It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain.
id="t-86870"&&However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.
id="t-93301"&&And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain.
id="t-99222"&&I think that we are approaching this dream. 

id="t-102502"&&And I would like to show you that we are very close to this.
id="t-108022"&&And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself. 

id="t-116516"&&So the story started 15 years ago.
id="t-119156"&&At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room.
id="t-124619"&&I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.
id="t-129193"&&You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.
id="t-139716"&&And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.
id="t-144801"&&And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.
id="t-150587"&&So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them. 

id="t-161379"&&What do I mean by that?
id="t-163174"&&We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.
id="t-168484"&&It's not an easy task.
id="t-170577"&&Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family.
id="t-179689"&&So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive.
id="t-187083"&&So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
id="t-190425"&&And after many attempts, Jean-François did it.
id="t-195372"&&And that's what he saw under his microscope. 

id="t-199691"&&And that was, for us, a major surprise.
id="t-202412"&&Why?
id="t-203587"&&Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.
id="t-215168"&&And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body.
id="t-227423"&&The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain.
id="t-238519"&&So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater. 

id="t-246269"&&And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.
id="t-258409"&&And they never die, they're immortal cells.
id="t-261407"&&But these cells behave differently.
id="t-264663"&&They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died.
id="t-271321"&&So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently. 

id="t-279052"&&And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.
id="t-283520"&&They come from these cells.
id="t-286550"&&These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
id="t-292195"&&All of you have them in your brain.
id="t-295353"&&They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.
id="t-299857"&&They have a very important role during the development stage.
id="t-303953"&&When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself.
id="t-310120"&&But why do they stay in your head?
id="t-313371"&&This, we don't know.
id="t-315414"&&We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions.
id="t-323324"&&But it's not so sure.
id="t-325867"&&But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture.
id="t-333363"&&And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain.
id="t-338004"&&And we had to prove this. 

id="t-339585"&&So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm.
id="t-344632"&&The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.
id="t-355148"&&And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain.
id="t-361295"&&And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual.
id="t-365255"&&We call these autologous grafts -- autografts. 

id="t-369602"&&So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?"
id="t-381463"&&Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys. 

id="t-387414"&&So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear. 

id="t-407780"&&In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons.
id="t-421824"&&And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.
id="t-425635"&&Those are the cells that were re-implanted.
id="t-428839"&&And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture. 

id="t-437755"&&But we could not stop here, of course.
id="t-440521"&&Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?
id="t-445182"&&So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.
id="t-450688"&&They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.
id="t-453730"&&They were very good at it.
id="t-455896"&&And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.
id="t-465711"&&So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore.
id="t-470165"&&And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke.
id="t-478737"&&Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey. 

id="t-489209"&&So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
id="t-498287"&&So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.
id="t-505426"&&He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion.
id="t-512079"&&He's not so accurate, not so quick.
id="t-515376"&&And look now, when we re-impant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual. 

id="t-525255"&&(Applause) 

id="t-532770"&&It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.
id="t-537321"&&Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.
id="t-541575"&&We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on.
id="t-546214"&&We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example.
id="t-552121"&&But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
id="t-556469"&&And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself. 

id="t-566623"&&Thank you. 

id="t-525255"&&(Applause) 

id="t-573977"&&Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."
id="t-585080"&&I do, in any case.
id="t-587364"&&And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials? 

Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations.

id="t-610314"&&BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc. 

id="t-612970"&&JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know? 

id="t-619407"&&BG: If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available? 

id="t-637555"&&JB: So, it's very difficult to say.
id="t-639714"&&It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.
id="t-643672"&&Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?
id="t-646799"&&And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients.
id="t-652461"&&So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.
id="t-661093"&&And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.
id="t-665776"&&You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody. 

BG: And safe, of course.
BG: And safe, of course.

id="t-674780"&&BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.
id="t-677598"&&BG: Thank you. 

id="t-525255"&&(Applause)
