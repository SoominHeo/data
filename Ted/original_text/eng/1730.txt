id="t-690000"&&I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.
id="t-694000"&&One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely, is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions.
