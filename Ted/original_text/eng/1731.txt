id="t-0"&&When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe, it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population is HIV positive.
id="t-11000"&&It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
id="t-20000"&&For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.
id="t-24000"&&When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.
id="t-28000"&&He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.
id="t-35000"&&He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
id="t-42000"&&When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.
id="t-53000"&&Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.
id="t-57000"&&I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy, and he asked me for slippers, because he said that his feet were cold. 

id="t-65000"&&This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.
id="t-68000"&&Single mother, HIV positive.
id="t-71000"&&I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.
id="t-76000"&&And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know, but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of 23.
id="t-87000"&&Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter, like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic.
id="t-94000"&&So a few of the stories.
id="t-96000"&&With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told.
id="t-105000"&&All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. 

id="t-210000"&&Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute, just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa? 

id="t-217000"&&Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh. 

id="t-218000"&&CA: Just -- 

id="t-219000"&&KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer.
id="t-225000"&&And I was constantly reading the New York Times, and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.
id="t-232000"&&It was just frightening.
id="t-234000"&&So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.
id="t-240000"&&And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month -- this is in December 2000 -- then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half, and then went back again this March 2002 for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. 

id="t-255000"&&CA: That's an amazing story, thank you. 

id="t-257000"&&KB: Thanks for letting me show these.
