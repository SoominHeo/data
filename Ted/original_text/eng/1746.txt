id="t-0"&&I was here about four years ago, talking about the relationship of design and happiness.
id="t-8000"&&At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.
id="t-14000"&&I learned very few things in addition since (Laughter) -- but made a whole number of them into projects since.
id="t-27000"&&These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland: "Everybody always thinks they are right."
id="t-40000"&&They were combined in the media.
id="t-45000"&&"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."
id="t-55000"&&We're doing changing media.
id="t-59000"&&This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by.
id="t-64000"&&You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.
id="t-70000"&&All of these things are pieces of graphic design.
id="t-74000"&&We do them for our clients.
id="t-76000"&&They are commissioned.
id="t-78000"&&I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these, so there's always a client attached to them.
id="t-92000"&&These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.
id="t-103000"&&"Worrying solves nothing."
id="t-105000"&&"Money does not make me happy" appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.
id="t-114000"&&The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.
id="t-117000"&&When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages.
id="t-121000"&&It said, "Money does does make me happy."
id="t-124000"&&And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building.
id="t-138000"&&So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.
id="t-140000"&&It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street, it says, "does not make me happy."
id="t-147000"&&We had a show that just came down last week in New York.
id="t-153000"&&We steamed up the windows permanently, and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.
id="t-163000"&&Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli.
id="t-170000"&&Singapore was quite in discussion.
id="t-174000"&&This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.
id="t-185000"&&And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart, because all of these sentiments -- some banal, some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary.
id="t-211000"&&And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.
id="t-219000"&&If it's -- see it for a long enough time, I actually do something about it.
id="t-225000"&&And the very last one is a billboard.
id="t-232000"&&This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.
id="t-236000"&&This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.
id="t-241000"&&We let that lie around in the sun.
id="t-242000"&&As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.
id="t-247000"&&After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off, shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot, so on day one the billboard said, "Complaining is silly.
id="t-247000"&&After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off, shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot, so on day one the billboard said, "Complaining is silly.
id="t-259000"&&Three days later it faded, and a week later, no more complaining anywhere.
id="t-265000"&&(Laughter) Thank you so much.
id="t-267000"&&(Applause)
