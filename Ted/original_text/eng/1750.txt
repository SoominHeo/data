Hi.
Hi.

id="t-9000"&&And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it.
id="t-22000"&&And I asked myself, why?
id="t-25000"&&I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
id="t-27000"&&And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?
id="t-31000"&&So, I decided to investigate. 

id="t-32000"&&I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
id="t-38000"&&And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
id="t-47000"&&But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son.
id="t-53000"&&It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. 

id="t-56000"&&So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
id="t-60000"&&I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask.
id="t-68000"&&I know a woman who's good at this.
id="t-70000"&&She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
id="t-76000"&&And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
id="t-79000"&&And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.
id="t-83000"&&And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores.
id="t-89000"&&And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"

id="t-91000"&&So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
id="t-93000"&&Why were other people blocking it?
id="t-94000"&&Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"
id="t-102000"&&And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
id="t-106000"&&I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
id="t-108000"&&I'm telling you where I need your help.
id="t-110000"&&And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.
id="t-115000"&&Because what can you do with that data?
id="t-117000"&&You could neglect me.
id="t-119000"&&You could abuse it.
id="t-120000"&&Or you could actually meet my need. 

id="t-122000"&&And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
id="t-127000"&&The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."
id="t-130000"&&I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
id="t-138000"&&So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
id="t-140000"&&I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
id="t-140000"&&I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
id="t-140000"&&I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
id="t-149000"&&Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
id="t-151000"&&Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. 

id="t-154000"&&And it's simple.
id="t-155000"&&And why should we care about this?
id="t-157000"&&We talk about world peace.
id="t-158000"&&How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
id="t-161000"&&I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
id="t-165000"&&So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
id="t-167000"&&And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.
id="t-173000"&&And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job.
id="t-176000"&&And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. 

id="t-182000"&&Thank you.
id="t-184000"&&(Applause)
