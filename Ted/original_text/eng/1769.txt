id="t-0"&&Dogs have interests.
id="t-2000"&&They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.
id="t-8000"&&And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
id="t-13000"&&It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here," and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.
id="t-28000"&&I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."
id="t-32000"&&It's a difficult choice, right?
id="t-32000"&&It's a difficult choice, right?
id="t-32000"&&It's a difficult choice, right?
id="t-36000"&&I mean, you lose.
id="t-38000"&&You cannot compete with the environment, if you have an adolescent dog's brain.
id="t-43000"&&So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view. 

id="t-49000"&&Now, I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog, number one, by making up rules, human rules.
id="t-62000"&&We don't take the dog's point of view into account.
id="t-64000"&&So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.
id="t-67000"&&We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."
id="t-71000"&&Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.
id="t-74000"&&And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
id="t-74000"&&And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
id="t-74000"&&And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
id="t-84000"&&When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg -- you know, isn't that nice?
id="t-89000"&&And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
id="t-91000"&&You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.
id="t-95000"&&His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.
id="t-102000"&&Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.
id="t-105000"&&I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get. 

id="t-110000"&&So, this whole dominance issue -- number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system.
id="t-120000"&&And they take this stuff seriously.
id="t-122000"&&Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy, because it prevents physical fights.
id="t-127000"&&Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.
id="t-133000"&&The number one is, "I have it, you don't."
id="t-135000"&&And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.
id="t-143000"&&So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog.
id="t-143000"&&So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog.

id="t-149000"&&Dogs get so abused.
id="t-151000"&&Dogs, horses and humans -- these are the three species which are so abused in life.
id="t-156000"&&And the reason is built into their behavior -- is to always come back and apologize.
id="t-156000"&&And the reason is built into their behavior -- is to always come back and apologize.
id="t-156000"&&And the reason is built into their behavior -- is to always come back and apologize.
id="t-164000"&&They are just so beatable, and that's why they get beaten.
id="t-168000"&&The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?
id="t-173000"&&"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws, stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."
id="t-183000"&&Because he grew?
id="t-185000"&&And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?
id="t-188000"&&This is insanity.
id="t-191000"&&I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"
id="t-194000"&&And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."
id="t-197000"&&I said, "Let's teach him to sit."
id="t-199000"&&And then we give him a reason for sitting.
id="t-203000"&&Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL.
id="t-209000"&&I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
id="t-214000"&&Go on, something should happen now.
id="t-214000"&&Go on, something should happen now.
id="t-214000"&&Go on, something should happen now.
id="t-219000"&&Well, I've got news for you.
id="t-221000"&&The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French. 

id="t-226000"&&So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL, English as a second language.
id="t-231000"&&And that's how we use the food lure in the hand, and we use food because we're dealing with owners.
id="t-236000"&&My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer, much better than I am.
id="t-239000"&&I don't need food, but the average owner says, "Puppy, sit."
id="t-244000"&&Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."
id="t-246000"&&They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason, like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.
id="t-252000"&&You know, "Sit, sit."
id="t-254000"&&No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials. 

id="t-258000"&&Then we phase out the food as a lure, and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit, and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence.
id="t-266000"&&"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."
id="t-270000"&&And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to" and the name of my son, "Jamie."
id="t-275000"&&And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
id="t-279000"&&He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready.
id="t-279000"&&He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready.

id="t-288000"&&So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
id="t-291000"&&Will it do it?
id="t-293000"&&Not necessarily, no.
id="t-295000"&&As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff, why come to the owner?
id="t-300000"&&The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.
id="t-303000"&&The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.
id="t-306000"&&At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels. 

id="t-311000"&&So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy.
id="t-318000"&&We use the Premack principle.
id="t-320000"&&Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn't want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem, or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.
id="t-332000"&&That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.
id="t-335000"&&So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit," look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.
id="t-343000"&&Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.
id="t-345000"&&"Sit," sniff butt. 

id="t-347000"&&So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training.
id="t-354000"&&And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.
id="t-362000"&&And I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita, saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.
id="t-370000"&&They're like Golden Retrievers.
id="t-372000"&&All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.
id="t-374000"&&They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food.
id="t-382000"&&It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.
id="t-385000"&&Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
id="t-391000"&&And now the dog's really happy.
id="t-393000"&&And this, to me, is always what training is.
id="t-395000"&&So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. 

id="t-403000"&&Now we move to phase three, when now -- there's times, you know, when daddy knows best.
id="t-408000"&&And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, "Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
id="t-408000"&&And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, "Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
id="t-408000"&&And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, "Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
id="t-408000"&&And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, "Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
id="t-417000"&&And there's times, for example, if my son's friends leave the door open, the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.
id="t-426000"&&This is a life-or-death thing.
id="t-428000"&&You leave this, the sanctity of your house, and you could be hit on the street.
id="t-433000"&&So some things we have to let the dog know, "You mustn't do this."

id="t-437000"&&And so we have to enforce, but without force.
id="t-442000"&&People here get very confused about what a punishment is.
id="t-446000"&&They think a punishment is something nasty.
id="t-448000"&&I bet a lot of you do, right?
id="t-450000"&&You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
id="t-453000"&&It doesn't have to be.
id="t-455000"&&There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future.
id="t-469000"&&It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
id="t-474000"&&And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be. 

id="t-479000"&&I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
id="t-482000"&&And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
id="t-487000"&&And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside.
id="t-492000"&&The dog is actually euthanized now, but this was a dog I worked with for a while.
id="t-496000"&&A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit -- we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.
id="t-505000"&&And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.
id="t-510000"&&When the dog would try to leave the mat, she would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."
id="t-516000"&&The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner, because we had a lot of aggression related towards food.
id="t-525000"&&The breaks got fewer and fewer.
id="t-527000"&&You see, the punishment was working.
id="t-530000"&&The behavior problem was going away.
id="t-532000"&&She never raised her voice.
id="t-534000"&&If she did, she would have got bitten.
id="t-537000"&&It's not a good dog you shout at.
id="t-539000"&&And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it -- killer whales.
id="t-539000"&&And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it -- killer whales.
id="t-550000"&&How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?
id="t-550000"&&How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?
id="t-550000"&&How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?
id="t-554000"&&Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?
id="t-559000"&&This is crazy. 

id="t-561000"&&So, where do we go from here?
id="t-563000"&&We want a better way.
id="t-565000"&&Dogs deserve better.
id="t-567000"&&But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
id="t-571000"&&It has to do with watching people train puppies, and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills.
id="t-581000"&&Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.
id="t-585000"&&I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.
id="t-588000"&&You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.
id="t-588000"&&You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.
id="t-588000"&&You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.
id="t-600000"&&The dog says, "I don't think so."
id="t-602000"&&(Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that?
id="t-602000"&&(Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that?
id="t-602000"&&(Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that?
id="t-614000"&&Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."
id="t-617000"&&I was walking onto a plane -- this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career, and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing, the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.
id="t-633000"&&You know, I puppy-train my child.
id="t-636000"&&And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair.
id="t-645000"&&"Johnny, don't do that."
id="t-647000"&&Kick, kick, kick.
id="t-645000"&&"Johnny, don't do that."
id="t-647000"&&Kick, kick, kick.
id="t-650000"&&I'm standing right here with my bag.
id="t-652000"&&The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.
id="t-656000"&&And ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, "What are you doing!
id="t-656000"&&And ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, "What are you doing!
id="t-664000"&&And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"
id="t-667000"&&That child has lost everything -- that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.
id="t-676000"&&And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"
id="t-678000"&&I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."
id="t-681000"&&I walked to the back of the plane, I sat down, and a thought came to me.
id="t-686000"&&If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.
id="t-602000"&&(Laughter) If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.
id="t-693000"&&He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go. 

id="t-698000"&&And this is what it's all about.
id="t-701000"&&These relationship skills are so easy.
id="t-703000"&&I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.
id="t-712000"&&You know, kind of like a little robot.
id="t-714000"&&This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.
id="t-717000"&&And then, a little behavior problem comes up.
id="t-719000"&&No different from the dog barking.
id="t-721000"&&The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
id="t-727000"&&And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.
id="t-733000"&&When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
id="t-740000"&&And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
id="t-743000"&&You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents.
id="t-751000"&&You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee.
id="t-755000"&&It's as if there's some schadenfreude there, that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong, so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them. 

id="t-766000"&&And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.
id="t-770000"&&It really is.
id="t-772000"&&We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.
id="t-775000"&&And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.
id="t-778000"&&You know, calculus is wonderful.
id="t-780000"&&When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.
id="t-782000"&&I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
id="t-782000"&&I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
id="t-782000"&&I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
id="t-791000"&&But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. 

id="t-795000"&&And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.
id="t-803000"&&Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.
id="t-808000"&&Your kids are easy to train.
id="t-810000"&&All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
id="t-817000"&&If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
id="t-820000"&&That is such a powerful training technique.
id="t-822000"&&This should be taught in schools.
id="t-824000"&&Relationships -- how do you negotiate?
id="t-826000"&&How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?
id="t-829000"&&You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?
id="t-832000"&&How on earth about raising children?
id="t-834000"&&We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant, and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.
id="t-839000"&&No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits, which are just as hard to break as bad habits.
id="t-848000"&&So, that would be my wish to the future.
id="t-850000"&&Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two -- so thank you very much.
id="t-850000"&&Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two -- so thank you very much.
id="t-860000"&&(Applause)
