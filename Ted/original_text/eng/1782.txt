id="t-0"&&The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
id="t-5000"&&But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
id="t-12000"&&Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses. 

id="t-21000"&&So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
id="t-25000"&&These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
id="t-30000"&&In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban. 

id="t-38000"&&And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
id="t-51000"&&And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
id="t-55000"&&Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications. 

id="t-68000"&&At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
id="t-78000"&&So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market. 

id="t-89000"&&We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.
id="t-89000"&&We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.
id="t-89000"&&We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.
id="t-89000"&&We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.

id="t-108000"&&This is our group, our main group of weavers.
id="t-111000"&&They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
id="t-113000"&&They all have bank accounts.
id="t-115000"&&They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
id="t-117000"&&It's a weekly turnaround of production.
id="t-119000"&&This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
id="t-123000"&&And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
id="t-129000"&&And the rest says it all. 

id="t-132000"&&Thank you very much.
id="t-133000"&&(Applause)
