id="t-0"&&Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier.
id="t-5000"&&So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
id="t-12000"&&And I want to tell you that story.
id="t-14000"&&I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
id="t-19000"&&It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
id="t-25000"&&We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
id="t-30000"&&Craig Venter chairs that event. 

id="t-32000"&&And I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space.
id="t-36000"&&And I said, "I can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g. And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
id="t-43000"&&Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
id="t-49000"&&You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
id="t-53000"&&Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
id="t-55000"&&You do it again and again.
id="t-57000"&&You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
id="t-61000"&&We set out to do this.
id="t-63000"&&It took us 11 years to become operational.
id="t-65000"&&And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
id="t-67000"&&We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-74000"&&And he wanted to go.
id="t-76000"&&We worked hard to get all the permissions.
id="t-79000"&&And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
id="t-82000"&&We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g. And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
id="t-94000"&&Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
id="t-99000"&&And what he said, for me, was very moving.
id="t-101000"&&He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
id="t-105000"&&I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
id="t-108000"&&I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
id="t-112000"&&We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane. 

id="t-124000"&&We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us.
id="t-132000"&&A few TEDsters here.
id="t-134000"&&We set up a whole ER.
id="t-136000"&&We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
id="t-139000"&&We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
id="t-143000"&&We had everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
id="t-149000"&&We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands. 

id="t-154000"&&And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g. Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
id="t-166000"&&And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great.
id="t-166000"&&And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great.
id="t-174000"&&So we did a second parabola. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-179000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-185000"&&And a third. 

id="t-179000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-188000"&&We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
id="t-197000"&&And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-202000"&&And a seventh and an eighth.
id="t-204000"&&And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man. 

id="t-73000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-208000"&&He was so happy.
id="t-210000"&&We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
id="t-216000"&&Please join us in this epic adventure.
id="t-218000"&&Thank you so much. 

id="t-179000"&&(Applause)
