id="t-13000"&&My family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing, and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.
id="t-21000"&&And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
id="t-21000"&&And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
id="t-21000"&&And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
id="t-21000"&&And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
id="t-21000"&&And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
id="t-37000"&&And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission, "I will pay for every year you're at MIT, in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."
id="t-49000"&&And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.
id="t-53000"&&And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics, I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two. 

id="t-59000"&&I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
id="t-62000"&&And I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together.
id="t-71000"&&He said to me something that just went completely over my head.
id="t-75000"&&He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits, but I don't like grey pin-striped suits."
id="t-84000"&&And I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.
id="t-88000"&&I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture, and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.
id="t-97000"&&That really, the mixing of art and science was computers, and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that. 

id="t-106000"&&And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale, I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.
id="t-121000"&&And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on, I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.
id="t-128000"&&Something that would be important, but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."
id="t-136000"&&And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people, knowing people who were either executives or wealthy, and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.
id="t-149000"&&My career, I mean, I'd done my career.
id="t-151000"&&Didn't have to worry about earning money.
id="t-153000"&&Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.
id="t-156000"&&And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features," and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children, and bringing to the world the access of the computers, that that was really the thing we should do.

id="t-197000"&&What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software, and then test them for a few hours.
id="t-205000"&&But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.

id="t-222000"&&Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.
id="t-228000"&&But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. 

id="t-237000"&&And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"
id="t-240000"&&I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"
id="t-243000"&&Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it.

id="t-271000"&&What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently, and when they debug the programs, they come the closest to learning about learning.
id="t-282000"&&That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.
id="t-286000"&&Kids don't program enough and boy, if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.

id="t-353000"&&And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.

id="t-430000"&&And while this machine in some sense is silly, in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.
id="t-436000"&&That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.
id="t-436000"&&That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.

id="t-447000"&&Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.
id="t-453000"&&In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it, we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.
id="t-463000"&&You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.
id="t-466000"&&I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.
id="t-470000"&&And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things. 

id="t-475000"&&Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates, who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."
id="t-482000"&&That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to.
id="t-482000"&&That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to.
id="t-493000"&&That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.
id="t-499000"&&Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.
id="t-501000"&&We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
id="t-501000"&&We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
id="t-501000"&&We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
id="t-508000"&&And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
id="t-511000"&&And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. 

id="t-514000"&&And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.
id="t-514000"&&And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.
id="t-514000"&&And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.
id="t-524000"&&The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.
id="t-528000"&&Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design, cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.
id="t-536000"&&And, in English, the word "cheap" has a double meaning, which is really appropriate, because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.
id="t-546000"&&But if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration, very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing -- so you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do. 

id="t-559000"&&And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.
id="t-564000"&&These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.
id="t-568000"&&But it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.
id="t-574000"&&It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody -- you know, good design is very important.
id="t-580000"&&Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.

id="t-658000"&&There is no keyboard standard because there's no market.
id="t-661000"&&And this is the big difference. 

id="t-664000"&&Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.
id="t-667000"&&So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.
id="t-671000"&&And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.
id="t-674000"&&So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.

id="t-695000"&&In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.
id="t-699000"&&We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out, and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. 

id="t-705000"&&And so I went to each of those countries at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.
id="t-711000"&&In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.
id="t-714000"&&This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.
