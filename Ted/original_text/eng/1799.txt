id="t-1000"&&This is a work in process, based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.
id="t-12000"&&(Music) (Video) Narrator: On this planet, 1.6 billion people don't have access to electricity, refrigeration or stored fuels.
id="t-26000"&&This is a problem.
id="t-28000"&&It impacts: the spread of disease, the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life.
id="t-40000"&&So here's the plan: inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity, propane, gas, kerosene or consumables.
id="t-48000"&&Time for some thermodynamics.
id="t-50000"&&And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator. 

id="t-53000"&&Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration.
id="t-58000"&&It's one of those things that stuck in my head.
id="t-60000"&&It was a lot like the Stirling engine: it was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it.
id="t-64000"&&And it was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carre, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. 

id="t-71000"&&This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928, and it was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works.
id="t-82000"&&There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.
id="t-84000"&&One has a working fluid, water and ammonia, and the other is a condenser.
id="t-88000"&&You heat up one side, the hot side.
id="t-90000"&&The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side.
id="t-94000"&&You let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect.
id="t-103000"&&So, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up.
id="t-106000"&&Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
id="t-106000"&&Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
id="t-106000"&&Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
id="t-106000"&&Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
id="t-116000"&&But it was kind of an interesting thought. 

id="t-118000"&&So, the great thing about 2006 is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.
id="t-124000"&&So, we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics.
id="t-130000"&&We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.
id="t-133000"&&We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures.
id="t-137000"&&Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people, it turned out, in the U.K. -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator. 

id="t-149000"&&So, this is the way it works.
id="t-150000"&&You put it on a cooking fire.
id="t-151000"&&Most people have cooking fires in the world, whether it's camel dung or wood.
id="t-155000"&&It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.
id="t-158000"&&Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
id="t-158000"&&Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
id="t-158000"&&Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
id="t-158000"&&Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
id="t-167000"&&Weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.
id="t-170000"&&You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
id="t-170000"&&You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
id="t-181000"&&We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars, in low volumes for about 40 dollars.
id="t-186000"&&And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. 

id="t-190000"&&Thank you.
id="t-191000"&&(Applause)
