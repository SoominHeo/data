id="t-43000"&&I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.
id="t-45000"&&I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.
id="t-51000"&&The challenge of looking at nature's designs -- and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.
id="t-57000"&&The challenge, of course, is to answer this question: what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere?
id="t-65000"&&And if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs? 

id="t-72000"&&Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others, organisms have millions of years to get it right; they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.
id="t-81000"&&So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.
id="t-85000"&&We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.
id="t-97000"&&And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it, are really severe.

id="t-97000"&&And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it, are really severe.
id="t-118000"&&Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. 

id="t-126000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-128000"&&And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.
id="t-136000"&&So, organisms have this important history.
id="t-139000"&&Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.
id="t-144000"&&And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.
id="t-147000"&&Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.
id="t-154000"&&You need to discover the general principles of nature, and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.
id="t-164000"&&This is a real challenge to do this, because animals, when you start to really look inside them -- how they work -- appear hopelessly complex.
id="t-164000"&&This is a real challenge to do this, because animals, when you start to really look inside them -- how they work -- appear hopelessly complex.
id="t-177000"&&They have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.
id="t-181000"&&Even the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect, and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. 

How can you make sense of this?
How can you make sense of this?
id="t-206000"&&What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move.
id="t-216000"&&They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.
id="t-220000"&&And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists.

id="t-220000"&&And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists.
id="t-231000"&&Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog, or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect, or four legs as one of a trotting crab.
id="t-243000"&&And then they alternate in their propulsion, but the patterns are all the same.
id="t-243000"&&And then they alternate in their propulsion, but the patterns are all the same.

id="t-261000"&&Now, what's interesting is the animals, then -- we said -- bounce along the vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar, in "A Bug's Life," we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants.
id="t-271000"&&And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.
id="t-271000"&&And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.

id="t-283000"&&Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.
id="t-286000"&&We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well.
id="t-286000"&&We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well.
id="t-294000"&&We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem.
id="t-299000"&&And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down, but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.
id="t-307000"&&And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
id="t-309000"&&Now, why is this important to have this model?

id="t-332000"&&That's enough!

id="t-337000"&&The animals, when you look at them running, appear to be self-stabilizing like this, using basically springy legs.
id="t-337000"&&The animals, when you look at them running, appear to be self-stabilizing like this, using basically springy legs.
id="t-351000"&&Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?
id="t-358000"&&Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies, at least they have been so far.
id="t-365000"&&Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.
id="t-370000"&&Human technologies have tended to be large, flat, with right angles, stiff, made of metal.

id="t-407000"&&And here's one example that's really exciting.
id="t-409000"&&This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.
id="t-411000"&&And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.
id="t-415000"&&It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like, and put in the material properties.
id="t-423000"&&They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.
id="t-426000"&&For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff, the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.
id="t-434000"&&It just bends by itself beautifully.
id="t-434000"&&It just bends by itself beautifully.
id="t-434000"&&It just bends by itself beautifully.
id="t-446000"&&Our work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot, from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.
id="t-460000"&&Let's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries.
id="t-468000"&&Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside, not on a treadmill.
id="t-474000"&&Here's what we do. 

id="t-126000"&&(Laughter) 

This is a death's head cockroach.
This is a death's head cockroach.
id="t-485000"&&This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.
id="t-492000"&&Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks -- they're bouncing along as they move.
id="t-492000"&&Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks -- they're bouncing along as they move.

id="t-505000"&&It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.
id="t-512000"&&What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo, the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.

id="t-528000"&&Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability.
id="t-533000"&&So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at.
