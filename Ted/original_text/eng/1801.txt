id="t-0"&&One way to change our genes is to make new ones, as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.
id="t-4000"&&Another is to change our lifestyles.
id="t-7000"&&And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be, that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
id="t-14000"&&When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
id="t-21000"&&But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.
id="t-24000"&&Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now.
id="t-28000"&&This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us. 

id="t-33000"&&Now, there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells.
id="t-38000"&&Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries, alcohol in moderation, stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana.
id="t-46000"&&I'm just the messenger.
id="t-49000"&&(Laughter) What were we just talking about?
id="t-49000"&&(Laughter) And other things that can make it worse, that can cause you to lose brain cells.
id="t-61000"&&The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress. 

id="t-68000"&&Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle, so you age less quickly.
id="t-68000"&&Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle, so you age less quickly.
id="t-74000"&&Your heart gets more blood flow.
id="t-76000"&&We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
id="t-78000"&&That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left, after only a year become measurably less clogged.
id="t-83000"&&And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left, the blue means no blood flow.
id="t-87000"&&A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.
id="t-90000"&&We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer, simply by making these changes.
id="t-97000"&&We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes, whereas only nine percent in the comparison group. 

id="t-105000"&&These differences were highly significant.
id="t-107000"&&Even your sexual organs get more blood flow, so you increase sexual potency.
id="t-111000"&&One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services, showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries, can cause a heart attack or a stroke, but it also causes impotence.
id="t-121000"&&Half of guys who smoke are impotent.
id="t-123000"&&How sexy is that? 

id="t-124000"&&Now we're also about to publish a study -- the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
id="t-129000"&&This is what's called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.
id="t-134000"&&And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed -- in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes, turning off the disease-promoting genes. 

id="t-144000"&&And so these findings I think are really very powerful, giving many people new hope and new choices.
id="t-149000"&&And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe, that are giving you your genetic profiles, are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"
id="t-160000"&&Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes -- they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise, we can actually change how our genes are expressed.
id="t-170000"&&Thank you.
id="t-171000"&&(Applause)
