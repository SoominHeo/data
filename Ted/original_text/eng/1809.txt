id="t-0"&&Just to put everything in context, and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from, so that a lot of the things I'm going to say, and the things I'm going to do -- or things I'm going to tell you I've done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
id="t-20000"&&I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
id="t-24000"&&And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
id="t-30000"&&Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
id="t-35000"&&And by the time I was an intern house officer, I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car -- and I was a paid doctor.
id="t-48000"&&This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora.
id="t-56000"&&Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing, where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
id="t-66000"&&Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision. 

id="t-73000"&&All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
id="t-84000"&&People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
id="t-93000"&&But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago.
id="t-93000"&&But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago.
id="t-106000"&&Very interesting. 

id="t-109000"&&How many people do you think are on that taxi?
id="t-113000"&&And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
id="t-116000"&&And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
id="t-116000"&&And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
id="t-116000"&&And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
id="t-116000"&&And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
id="t-130000"&&So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos.
id="t-130000"&&So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos.
id="t-130000"&&So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos.
id="t-143000"&&And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital. 

id="t-157000"&&Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
id="t-161000"&&Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
id="t-165000"&&And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
id="t-165000"&&And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
id="t-165000"&&And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
id="t-191000"&&Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
id="t-196000"&&I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as, AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
id="t-205000"&&I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
id="t-209000"&&When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things, I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things, or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
id="t-222000"&&What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled? 

I think it's quite significant.
I think it's quite significant.
id="t-232000"&&These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital.
id="t-232000"&&These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital.
id="t-242000"&&Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
id="t-247000"&&That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
id="t-250000"&&You remember all that oil?
id="t-252000"&&Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this.
id="t-252000"&&Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this.
id="t-260000"&&You can say some of this is education.
id="t-260000"&&You can say some of this is education.
id="t-260000"&&You can say some of this is education.
id="t-266000"&&I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination, malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
id="t-278000"&&In fact, when I start running around saying, "Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S., can you come home with me and do a mission?"
id="t-286000"&&I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."

Now, have a look at that.
Now, have a look at that.
id="t-291000"&&And that's my specialty, right?
id="t-293000"&&Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
id="t-297000"&&It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. And believe me, these are current pictures.
id="t-304000"&&Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go.
id="t-304000"&&Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go.

id="t-314000"&&All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria, and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
id="t-328000"&&Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
id="t-336000"&&So, these are the problems.
id="t-339000"&&There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
id="t-339000"&&There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
id="t-339000"&&There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
id="t-339000"&&There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
id="t-339000"&&There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?

id="t-354000"&&There we go -- we're going on a mission.
id="t-354000"&&There we go -- we're going on a mission.
id="t-354000"&&There we go -- we're going on a mission.
id="t-368000"&&We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
id="t-373000"&&Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity.
id="t-373000"&&Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity.
id="t-385000"&&Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
id="t-390000"&&Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
id="t-393000"&&You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first. 

So, here we are, mission.
So, here we are, mission.
id="t-403000"&&Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.
id="t-406000"&&That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
id="t-409000"&&Does he look like he's happy?
id="t-411000"&&It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it.
id="t-411000"&&It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it.
id="t-420000"&&Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it."
id="t-420000"&&Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it."
id="t-420000"&&Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it."

id="t-431000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-432000"&&I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
id="t-436000"&&Yes, let's just go work this thing out.
id="t-440000"&&See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
id="t-444000"&&We get a lot of donated equipment.
id="t-446000"&&Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it.
id="t-446000"&&Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it.

But we had problems with it.
But we had problems with it.
But we had problems with it.
But we had problems with it.
id="t-461000"&&So what we going to do now?
id="t-463000"&&It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that.
id="t-473000"&&We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these.
id="t-473000"&&We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these.

id="t-479000"&&The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.

id="t-496000"&&Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
id="t-499000"&&You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them.
id="t-499000"&&You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them.
id="t-507000"&&And we were doing open-heart surgery. 

id="t-509000"&&OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff.
id="t-509000"&&OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff.

id="t-526000"&&You still get people who believe in it and they came.
id="t-529000"&&At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
id="t-534000"&&Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child.

id="t-567000"&&The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. 

But how many did we do the first one?
But how many did we do the first one?
id="t-573000"&&We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
id="t-577000"&&Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right?
id="t-584000"&&This is what I mean about appropriate technology.
id="t-588000"&&That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
id="t-594000"&&Have you seen one of those before?
id="t-594000"&&Have you seen one of those before?
id="t-594000"&&Have you seen one of those before?
id="t-594000"&&Have you seen one of those before?
id="t-600000"&&I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before: "We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long -- 

id="t-606000"&&(Applause) -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."

id="t-606000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-840000"&&Thank you.
id="t-840000"&&Thank you.
id="t-619000"&&This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
id="t-624000"&&So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
id="t-628000"&&Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going."

id="t-635000"&&And that's a perfect example of one.
id="t-637000"&&Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport.
id="t-637000"&&Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport.
id="t-647000"&&If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on.

id="t-665000"&&This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
id="t-673000"&&That's exactly how the outlets are designed.

id="t-759000"&&These are the basic features of my device, or our device.
id="t-763000"&&This is what makes it so special.
