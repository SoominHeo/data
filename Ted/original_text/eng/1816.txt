id="t-1000"&&I started juggling a long time ago, but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.
id="t-9000"&&And as a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores, that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.
id="t-19000"&&And it's the process of learning things.
id="t-21000"&&One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.
id="t-25000"&&And he had a real passion for golf, and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things.
id="t-32000"&&Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.
id="t-38000"&&And that was the mythology of skill. 

id="t-41000"&&So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.
id="t-44000"&&And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.
id="t-53000"&&But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.
id="t-59000"&&But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling, and basically visual music, I guess.
id="t-70000"&&OK, you can start the music, thanks. 

id="t-72000"&&(Music) 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
id="t-269000"&&I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it.
id="t-274000"&&Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet. 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

Thanks.
Thanks.
id="t-377000"&&You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.
id="t-381000"&&Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.
id="t-387000"&&Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces.
id="t-393000"&&And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique.
id="t-397000"&&So juggling gravity -- up, down.
id="t-402000"&&If you figure out what up and down really are, it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything, but then you add in sideways. 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-445000"&&Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands, you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.
id="t-459000"&&So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm, with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were. 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

Thanks.
Thanks.
id="t-562000"&&I'm going to build towards complexity now.
id="t-564000"&&Juggling three balls is simple and normal. 

id="t-568000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-570000"&&Excuse me. 

id="t-568000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-574000"&&We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing, you're getting into a subculture here. 

id="t-568000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-580000"&&And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.
id="t-583000"&&OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.
id="t-590000"&&And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.
id="t-594000"&&You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
id="t-594000"&&You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
id="t-594000"&&You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
id="t-594000"&&You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
id="t-594000"&&You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
id="t-606000"&&But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.
id="t-610000"&&So, you've got to go after the space down there.
id="t-619000"&&OK, then you've got to combine them, because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.
id="t-631000"&&And then you get crazy. 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-645000"&&Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention.
id="t-645000"&&Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention.
id="t-659000"&&It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.
id="t-663000"&&Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.
id="t-663000"&&Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.
id="t-663000"&&Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.
id="t-670000"&&But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. 

So, complexity.
So, complexity.
id="t-679000"&&OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.
id="t-679000"&&OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.
id="t-679000"&&OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.

id="t-568000"&&(Laughter) 

No, it looks like a mess.
No, it looks like a mess.
id="t-704000"&&It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
id="t-944000"&&All right.
id="t-944000"&&All right.
id="t-944000"&&All right.
id="t-944000"&&All right.
id="t-716000"&&And you could play with the rhythm.
id="t-720000"&&Same pattern.
id="t-723000"&&Make it faster and smaller.
id="t-726000"&&Make it wider.
id="t-729000"&&Make it narrower.
id="t-734000"&&Bring it back up.
id="t-734000"&&Bring it back up.
id="t-734000"&&Bring it back up.
id="t-734000"&&Bring it back up.

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-743000"&&Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.
id="t-750000"&&I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are, but let's try something.
id="t-757000"&&OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is, I'm going to give you a little clue.

id="t-1014000"&&Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed.
id="t-1018000"&&So, a moment, how would you define a moment?
id="t-1021000"&&Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. 

id="t-1032000"&&Ahhh.
id="t-1035000"&&All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.
id="t-1038000"&&So, a moment.

OK?

id="t-1106000"&&And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?
id="t-1110000"&&Well, obviously, there's something in here, and you can all have a guess as to what it is.

id="t-1129000"&&Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece, because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this.
id="t-1136000"&&But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.

id="t-1150000"&&This is the piece that I told you about.
id="t-1152000"&&It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.

id="t-1248000"&&Cheating. 

id="t-568000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-1252000"&&Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat, so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.

id="t-1293000"&&The rhythm can get much smaller.
id="t-1303000"&&As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces, those tinier movements.

id="t-1446000"&&I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.

id="t-1583000"&&This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.

id="t-1626000"&&This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape. 

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1682000"&&Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference.
id="t-1688000"&&Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.
id="t-1694000"&&Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with. 

id="t-1701000"&&The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece, if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago, which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs.

id="t-1722000"&&It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents. 

id="t-1735000"&&The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.

id="t-250000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1922000"&&Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run "S-Curve music?"

id="t-2065000"&&And the latest thing that I'm working on --

id="t-2084000"&&Well, because then it tells me the truth, instead of me imposing the truth.
id="t-2089000"&&And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves.
id="t-2094000"&&And what it involves, and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not, but I'll do a little bit of it. 

id="t-2101000"&&It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space.
id="t-2101000"&&It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space.

id="t-2130000"&&Because my attempt is to make visual instruments, not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.
id="t-2140000"&&For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.
id="t-2146000"&&Now, I don't know exactly where it's going, but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.
id="t-2150000"&&And it's going to change as I go through it.
id="t-2154000"&&But I really like it, it feels right.
