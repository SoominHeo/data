id="t-390000"&&So we are past our 1,000th show.
id="t-395000"&&Probably somewhere around 1,500.
id="t-396000"&&It's hard to know.
id="t-398000"&&We've only done two shows in 2007 so far, but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.
id="t-406000"&&It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed.
id="t-417000"&&So thank you.
id="t-422000"&&We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.
id="t-425000"&&How early can a rock performance begin?
id="t-432000"&&Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning.
id="t-439000"&&I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic.
id="t-451000"&&All right. 

id="t-452000"&&So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence.
id="t-462000"&&This song is called "Asbury Park."
