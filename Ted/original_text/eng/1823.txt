id="t-0"&&The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
id="t-4000"&&That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
id="t-4000"&&That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
id="t-14000"&&And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.
id="t-30000"&&(Laughter) OK. 

id="t-34000"&&So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
id="t-44000"&&And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
id="t-47000"&&When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
id="t-58000"&&And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.
id="t-73000"&&And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares. 

id="t-81000"&&Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.
id="t-95000"&&And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
id="t-101000"&&And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.
id="t-109000"&&Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
id="t-122000"&&I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
id="t-137000"&&And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different. 

id="t-150000"&&I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?
id="t-164000"&&And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
id="t-164000"&&And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
id="t-164000"&&And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
id="t-173000"&&And I had a miniature poodle.
id="t-175000"&&And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
id="t-177000"&&Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
id="t-182000"&&And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
id="t-186000"&&And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. 

id="t-204000"&&Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
id="t-210000"&&And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
id="t-218000"&&That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
id="t-231000"&&I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure. 

id="t-242000"&&But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.
id="t-247000"&&And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.
id="t-254000"&&And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
id="t-262000"&&My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.
id="t-269000"&&But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
id="t-272000"&&And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
id="t-272000"&&And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
id="t-272000"&&And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
id="t-286000"&&There was a reason for everything.
id="t-288000"&&And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
id="t-295000"&&And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
id="t-303000"&&And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.
id="t-311000"&&You become very creative, in a survival sense. 

id="t-315000"&&And this, then, led to my big questions.
id="t-319000"&&And they're the same ones that I have today.
id="t-322000"&&And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
id="t-327000"&&And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
id="t-334000"&&It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
id="t-339000"&&Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen.
id="t-339000"&&Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen.
id="t-352000"&&How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
id="t-356000"&&And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
id="t-360000"&&It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe. 

id="t-368000"&&And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.
id="t-379000"&&So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
id="t-390000"&&And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on. 

id="t-399000"&&And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.
id="t-413000"&&So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
id="t-420000"&&And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
id="t-424000"&&There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
id="t-430000"&&But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.
id="t-430000"&&But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.
id="t-440000"&&And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning. 

id="t-444000"&&There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.
id="t-444000"&&There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.
id="t-455000"&&And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.
id="t-455000"&&And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.
id="t-476000"&&You won't discover anything.
id="t-479000"&&And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.
id="t-487000"&&Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.
id="t-495000"&&And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
id="t-505000"&&(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time. 

id="t-509000"&&There is also a big question of ambiguity.
id="t-512000"&&And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
id="t-518000"&&And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
id="t-520000"&&And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
id="t-520000"&&And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
id="t-520000"&&And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
id="t-520000"&&And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
id="t-534000"&&It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq.
id="t-534000"&&It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq.
id="t-543000"&&A very famous Chinese saying, she said.
id="t-546000"&&And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.
id="t-546000"&&And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.
id="t-554000"&&So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."
id="t-562000"&&And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
id="t-567000"&&And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
id="t-570000"&&So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die. 

id="t-577000"&&Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
id="t-591000"&&And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
id="t-591000"&&And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
id="t-591000"&&And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
id="t-601000"&&But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions. 

id="t-609000"&&And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
id="t-614000"&&And then we have intentions.
id="t-616000"&&There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.
id="t-623000"&&And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
id="t-623000"&&And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
id="t-623000"&&And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
id="t-631000"&&What are we supposed to do?
id="t-633000"&&Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
id="t-646000"&&That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."

I saw examples of that.
I saw examples of that.
id="t-661000"&&I got these hints everywhere.
id="t-663000"&&And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
id="t-663000"&&And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
id="t-663000"&&And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
id="t-676000"&&And what I need, in effect, is a focus.
id="t-680000"&&And when I have the question, it is a focus.
id="t-682000"&&And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
id="t-692000"&&And it seems like it's happening all the time.
id="t-694000"&&You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.
id="t-700000"&&And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
id="t-703000"&&And you are noticing it more often. 

id="t-707000"&&But you apply this.
id="t-710000"&&You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
id="t-713000"&&Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
id="t-716000"&&Why or why not?
id="t-718000"&&It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.
id="t-725000"&&I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.
id="t-732000"&&And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"
id="t-740000"&&And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.
id="t-750000"&&So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. 

id="t-765000"&&We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
id="t-770000"&&We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
id="t-775000"&&Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
id="t-786000"&&Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.
id="t-792000"&&This leads to this question.
id="t-795000"&&When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe? 

id="t-812000"&&It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
id="t-815000"&&We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.
id="t-824000"&&In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
id="t-828000"&&Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
id="t-832000"&&My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
id="t-838000"&&Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.
id="t-851000"&&And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother. 

id="t-856000"&&There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
id="t-863000"&&In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
id="t-869000"&&And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
id="t-872000"&&And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God. 

id="t-890000"&&You wonder, are these things random chance?
id="t-890000"&&You wonder, are these things random chance?
id="t-890000"&&You wonder, are these things random chance?
id="t-890000"&&You wonder, are these things random chance?
id="t-897000"&&What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
id="t-901000"&&And that goes into the story, too.
id="t-903000"&&These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
id="t-906000"&&Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.
id="t-912000"&&But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
id="t-922000"&&Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen. 

id="t-926000"&&Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.
id="t-940000"&&And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt.
id="t-940000"&&And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt.
id="t-951000"&&And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
id="t-954000"&&For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.
id="t-961000"&&And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
id="t-964000"&&I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure.
id="t-964000"&&I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure.
id="t-976000"&&And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
id="t-981000"&&And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
id="t-984000"&&And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
id="t-988000"&&And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
id="t-993000"&&I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.
id="t-1000000"&&Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?
id="t-1007000"&&Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant? 

id="t-1014000"&&A big thing that I also think about is accidents.
id="t-1017000"&&And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
id="t-1020000"&&What is the nature of accidents?
id="t-1022000"&&And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?
id="t-1029000"&&I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
id="t-1029000"&&I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
id="t-1029000"&&I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
id="t-1040000"&&And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.
id="t-1045000"&&And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
id="t-1050000"&&And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident.
id="t-1050000"&&And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident.
id="t-1062000"&&60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
id="t-1068000"&&Responsibility was assigned to the family.
id="t-1070000"&&The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
id="t-1070000"&&The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
id="t-1070000"&&The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
id="t-1078000"&&It's the son, not the father."

id="t-1080000"&&When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
id="t-1086000"&&It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
id="t-1090000"&&And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
id="t-1093000"&&And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families.
id="t-1093000"&&And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families.
id="t-1114000"&&I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.
id="t-1114000"&&I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.
id="t-1131000"&&Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition.
id="t-1131000"&&Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition.

id="t-1148000"&&So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
id="t-1165000"&&Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
id="t-1165000"&&Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
id="t-1165000"&&Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
id="t-1177000"&&It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
id="t-1181000"&&But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
id="t-1187000"&&And how do I create my own life? 

id="t-1190000"&&And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
id="t-1197000"&&I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.
id="t-1208000"&&I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
id="t-1208000"&&I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
id="t-1208000"&&I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
id="t-1234000"&&And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
id="t-1245000"&&And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
id="t-1253000"&&And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before. 

id="t-1258000"&&So, there are never complete answers.
id="t-1261000"&&Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
id="t-1275000"&&And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.
id="t-1282000"&&And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating. 

id="t-1292000"&&And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
id="t-1308000"&&Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
id="t-1314000"&&I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
id="t-1320000"&&We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.
id="t-1339000"&&There she is.
id="t-1340000"&&Thank you very much!
id="t-1342000"&&(Applause)
