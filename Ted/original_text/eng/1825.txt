id="t-10000"&&And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.
id="t-14000"&&In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in New York City.
id="t-23000"&&And it cost about 500 dollars to start it, which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.
id="t-30000"&&By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing -- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper -- would come to cost two and a half million dollars.
id="t-41000"&&10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.
id="t-44000"&&That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
id="t-51000"&&And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. 

id="t-57000"&&Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce.
id="t-87000"&&Now, the term "information society," "information economy," for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution.

id="t-121000"&&And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned, depending on what kind of system they were in.

Now, let me tell you a different story.
id="t-145000"&&The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer -- the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S., and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer's capable of running -- sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.
id="t-166000"&&All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period, there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.
id="t-174000"&&Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working, by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes.
