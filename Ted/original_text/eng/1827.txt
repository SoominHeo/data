id="t-31000"&&And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior.
id="t-45000"&&Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
id="t-49000"&&How dare we be optimistic?
id="t-53000"&&Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
id="t-61000"&&As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
id="t-67000"&&And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior.

id="t-89000"&&I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
id="t-104000"&&But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs, it is more important to change the laws.
id="t-110000"&&And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part.

id="t-139000"&&I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.

id="t-181000"&&Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
id="t-190000"&&And the military historians taught me, during that quest, that military conflicts are typically put into three categories: local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
id="t-213000"&&And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational model.

id="t-334000"&&Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers.
id="t-340000"&&The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States, minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
