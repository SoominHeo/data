id="t-4000"&&Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ... 

id="t-14000"&&DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try.

id="t-71000"&&DH: Thank you.
id="t-72000"&&BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
id="t-72000"&&BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... 

id="t-82000"&&DH: All right, let's show them something special.

id="t-94000"&&BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on.
id="t-98000"&&Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented. 

id="t-101000"&&DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it. 

BF: Shut up.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-106000"&&DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

Folks, this is shaker cup juggling.
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling.

BF: Oh yeah, it does.

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

DH: One more?
DH: One more?
DH: One more?
DH: One more?
DH: One more?

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-167000"&&I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
id="t-173000"&&In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.
id="t-173000"&&In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.

id="t-181000"&&BF: Also three with his left. 

id="t-184000"&&DH: Perfect. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

And now, all six cups.
And now, all six cups.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

BF: First try?
BF: First try?

id="t-202000"&&(Audience: Once on purpose!)

id="t-204000"&&DH: How about if I try first and then decide? 

BF: Good idea.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Let's leave that.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Let's leave that.

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) (Applause) 

id="t-228000"&&DH: He's looking at me. 

BF: That's all right, he does that.
BF: That's all right, he does that.

DH: Oh!
DH: Oh!
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Oh, good.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Oh, good.

id="t-239000"&&BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard.
id="t-239000"&&BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard.
id="t-239000"&&BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard.
id="t-253000"&&And then we thought, "How stupid."

id="t-255000"&&DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone? 

id="t-258000"&&BF: I think that's the next session. 

id="t-260000"&&DH: Next session? 

id="t-552000"&&BF: Yeah.
id="t-552000"&&BF: Yeah.
id="t-265000"&&He actually assumes more of the danger in this. 

DH: Please stand up, Richard.

Oh, sorry.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-276000"&&DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks) 

id="t-278000"&&BF: OK, sorry. 

DH: Jesus Christ.
DH: Jesus Christ.

id="t-283000"&&Richard Wurman: Can I say something?
id="t-284000"&&BF: Sure. 

id="t-287000"&&RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. 

id="t-295000"&&DH: All right, please stand here in front ... God, I hate that.
id="t-295000"&&DH: All right, please stand here in front ... God, I hate that.

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter)

id="t-309000"&&Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
id="t-309000"&&Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
id="t-338000"&&OK. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-318000"&&DH: Wow, you've been working out. 

id="t-320000"&&BF: No, shut up!

Having a little bit of Richard time.
Having a little bit of Richard time.
id="t-330000"&&OK, here we go.

DH: Please hold my wrist, will you.
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you.

id="t-335000"&&There you go. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) OK. 

id="t-344000"&&OK, hold on. 

id="t-348000"&&RW: Hmmm. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-351000"&&DH: First one. 

id="t-353000"&&BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

DH: So Richard, what were we on the list?
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list?

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-364000"&&What happened there? 

id="t-366000"&&BF: I think we were just outside. 

DH: I don't get it.
id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

DH: Sorry.
DH: Sorry.

RW: Do you want me to hold you or not?
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not?

BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.

id="t-381000"&&DH: One more, one more. 

id="t-382000"&&BF: We've got one more we're going to do. 

id="t-384000"&&RW: Do I get to hold them? 

id="t-385000"&&BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me. 

id="t-388000"&&DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit? 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

BF: Gloria, you want to do it?
BF: Gloria, you want to do it?

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

One more try.
One more try.

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-422000"&&Could you just push that? 

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

DH: Wow!
DH: Wow!

BF: That's cool.
BF: That's cool.

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-452000"&&DH: Let's jump this way, though.
id="t-454000"&&Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
id="t-458000"&&So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
id="t-465000"&&And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ... 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

DH: Wow!
DH: Wow!

DH: True.
DH: True.

id="t-474000"&&BF: I'm going to run up behind him. 

id="t-476000"&&DH: Leap over my shoulder. 

id="t-477000"&&BF: Up and over his shoulders. 

id="t-479000"&&DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ... 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

Still juggling.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) Impossible, you say? 

id="t-490000"&&BF: Incredible, you say? 

id="t-492000"&&DH: Why bother, you say? 

id="t-495000"&&BF: Here we go. 

id="t-496000"&&DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? 

id="t-499000"&&BF: This guy, this guy invented air.
id="t-502000"&&DH: I think so, that's right.
id="t-503000"&&Even the pencil. 

id="t-505000"&&BF: He invented the pencil. 

id="t-507000"&&DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect. 

id="t-511000"&&BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see. 

id="t-513000"&&DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much. 

BF: No, it's a hassle.
BF: No, it's a hassle.
id="t-518000"&&Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp. 

id="t-523000"&&DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage? 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-532000"&&Or a virgin for a sacrifice? 

id="t-534000"&&BF: Anything? 

DH: Where's Gloria?
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-537000"&&BF: No, she's got ... farm animal. 

id="t-540000"&&DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
id="t-540000"&&DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
id="t-540000"&&DH: Do you have a small farm animal?

id="t-544000"&&BF: Over the top, over the top. 

DH: How you feeling, Barry?
DH: How you feeling, Barry?

id="t-548000"&&BF: Yeah, it's all right. 

DH: Do you feel everything's OK?
DH: Do you feel everything's OK?

id="t-550000"&&BF: Yeah, a little sketchy. 

id="t-551000"&&DH: Everything up here's OK? 

id="t-552000"&&BF: Yeah. 

id="t-553000"&&DH: Then here we go. 

BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights?
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights?
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights?
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) I can still see a little. 

id="t-566000"&&DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
id="t-566000"&&DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

BF: Yeah, it's too far.
BF: Yeah, it's too far.
id="t-578000"&&The design of the body is a whole different thing. 

DH: Ready, Barry?
DH: Ready, Barry?

DH: May we have our jumping music please?
DH: May we have our jumping music please?

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

BF: They're a good crew!
BF: They're a good crew!

DH: Whoa, sorry.
DH: Whoa, sorry.

id="t-604000"&&BF: We're going on. 

id="t-608000"&&DH: All right, we'll try again. 

BF: All right?
BF: All right?
BF: All right?

DH: All right, here we go.
DH: All right, here we go.

BF: I thought I had the hard part.
id="t-338000"&&OK. 

id="t-620000"&&DH: Whenever you're ready. 

id="t-626000"&&BF: There we go! 

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

All right, get up!
All right, get up!
All right, get up!
All right, get up!
All right, get up!
All right, get up!

id="t-116000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-646000"&&Wow, wow, OK, stop.
id="t-646000"&&Wow, wow, OK, stop.
id="t-646000"&&Wow, wow, OK, stop.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. 

id="t-654000"&&DH: The French judge ... 

id="t-655000"&&BF: One more quick thing. 

id="t-656000"&&DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-664000"&&BF: Well, you know ... 

DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah.
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah.

id="t-668000"&&DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff. 

id="t-552000"&&BF: Yeah.
id="t-552000"&&BF: Yeah.
id="t-673000"&&And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
id="t-678000"&&We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition. 

id="t-685000"&&DH: That's right. 

id="t-691000"&&BF: Good. 

id="t-694000"&&DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-703000"&&BF: Juggling's got a bad rap. 

id="t-708000"&&DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
id="t-714000"&&And look, it has a twin! 

BF: Shut up.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-721000"&&DH: There's still one more by my foot.
id="t-724000"&&What do you want me to do with it? 

BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.
id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-733000"&&DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard. 

BF: Yeah, it's a good setup.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup.

DH: You can't get any better than that.
DH: You can't get any better than that.
DH: You can't get any better than that.

id="t-744000"&&BF: Nice. 

id="t-746000"&&DH: I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. 

id="t-744000"&&BF: Nice. 

DH: I touched it, Barry.
DH: I touched it, Barry.

id="t-761000"&&BF: It's progress, that's the thing. 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

DH: How about that?
DH: How about that?
id="t-771000"&&Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
id="t-775000"&&And it's awfully windy over there. 

BF: It is, it's weird.
BF: It is, it's weird.
BF: It is, it's weird.
id="t-782000"&&Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. 

DH: Wow!
DH: Wow!
id="t-788000"&&Oh, look how it lies there.
id="t-793000"&&Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do? 

id="t-110000"&&(Laughter) 

You are my hero.
You are my hero.

BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club.

DH: Where, Barry?
DH: Where, Barry?
DH: Where, Barry?
DH: Where, Barry?
id="t-818000"&&What gem of knowledge?
id="t-820000"&&What pearl of wisdom?
id="t-823000"&&Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
id="t-829000"&&Is that your final answer? 

BF: All right!
BF: All right!

id="t-836000"&&DH: I do, I do.
id="t-837000"&&BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
id="t-839000"&&DH: We will juggle seven. 

BF: From six to seven.
BF: From six to seven.
BF: From six to seven.
BF: From six to seven.

id="t-843000"&&BF: Yes. 

id="t-848000"&&DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
id="t-850000"&&Put your tongue away, Barry.

DH: Please, please stay seated.
DH: Please, please stay seated.
DH: Please, please stay seated.
id="t-872000"&&Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... 

id="t-876000"&&BF: Seven-club juggling. 

id="t-878000"&&DH: ... to back. 

id="t-885000"&&BF: Thank you, that's it.
