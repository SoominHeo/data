id="t-6000"&&It's really quite an honor to be here tonight, and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired.
id="t-19000"&&And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are, literally, world premieres.
id="t-26000"&&I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. 

id="t-32000"&&This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology, which goes perfectly with this gathering.
id="t-44000"&&I started thinking about -- when I was in college, especially as a blind person, doing a research paper was a major undertaking.
id="t-54000"&&You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that.

id="t-54000"&&You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that.
id="t-64000"&&I wish I had that when I was in college.
id="t-67000"&&Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?
id="t-74000"&&It's called "All the Answers."

id="t-374000"&&This next song is a song 

id="t-377000"&&that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.
id="t-380000"&&It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems.
id="t-389000"&&One thing is, it's unpronounceable.
id="t-392000"&&And it's a made-up word.
id="t-394000"&&It's called "Tembererana."
id="t-396000"&&And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces.
id="t-407000"&&So "tembererana" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.
id="t-417000"&&So this is called "Tembererana."
id="t-421000"&&It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called "carnivalito."

id="t-430000"&&♫ A dream within a dream, ♫ 

id="t-433000"&&♫ a world within a world, ♫ 

id="t-436000"&&♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫ 

♫ travels out across the land.
♫ travels out across the land.

id="t-444000"&&♫ Images flickering, ♫ 

id="t-447000"&&♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫ 

id="t-449000"&&♫ a procession of limousines ♫ 

♫ travels slowly across the land.
♫ travels slowly across the land.

♫ Another child could use a hand.
♫ Another child could use a hand.

id="t-463000"&&♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ 

♫ Annihilation moves.
♫ Annihilation moves.

♫ The earth is an open tomb.
♫ The earth is an open tomb.

id="t-490000"&&♫ The sound of the final boom ♫ 

♫ rumbles fiercely across the land.
♫ rumbles fiercely across the land.

id="t-557000"&&♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫ 

id="t-561000"&&♫ I would run, run away ♫ 

id="t-565000"&&♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫ 

id="t-570000"&&♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ 

♫ had a name.

♫ It's the same name.
