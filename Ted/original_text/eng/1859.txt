Why so many mysteries?
Why so many mysteries?
id="t-27000"&&And I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.
id="t-30000"&&When I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
id="t-30000"&&When I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
id="t-30000"&&When I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) And I took enormous comfort in that.
id="t-42000"&&So thank you, if you're here. 

I was trying to think, what do I talk about?

id="t-50000"&&And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do, and I started thinking about my grandfather.

id="t-50000"&&And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do, and I started thinking about my grandfather.
id="t-63000"&&And one of the reasons he was amazing: After World War II he began an electronics company.
id="t-67000"&&He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
id="t-67000"&&He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
id="t-67000"&&He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
id="t-78000"&&And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them, and reveal the inner workings -- which many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.
id="t-84000"&&But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
id="t-86000"&&To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is.
id="t-91000"&&He was the ultimate deconstructer, in many ways.
id="t-95000"&&And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart, but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts, like, you know, printing, like the letter press.

id="t-108000"&&I'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making.
id="t-111000"&&When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff. 

id="t-115000"&&And last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.

id="t-126000"&&Rives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair; he does pop-up books.
id="t-131000"&&And I'm obsessed with, like, engineering of paper.
id="t-133000"&&But like, the scoring of it, the printing of it, where the thing gets glued, you know, the registration marks for the ink.
id="t-133000"&&But like, the scoring of it, the printing of it, where the thing gets glued, you know, the registration marks for the ink.
id="t-139000"&&My grandfather was sort of the guy who, you know, kind of got me into all sorts of these things.
id="t-143000"&&He would also supply me with tools.
id="t-145000"&&He was this amazing encourager -- this patron, sort of, to make stuff.
id="t-150000"&&And he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.
id="t-154000"&&And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly, to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.
id="t-160000"&&And you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.
id="t-163000"&&He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.
id="t-166000"&&I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like, "Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.
id="t-166000"&&I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like, "Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.
id="t-166000"&&I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like, "Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.

id="t-166000"&&I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like, "Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.

id="t-178000"&&And you know, and my grandmother was the greatest.
id="t-180000"&&Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone.
id="t-180000"&&Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone.
id="t-180000"&&Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone.
id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) So I found myself getting this stuff, thanks to her assist, and suddenly, you know, I had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old -- this kind of stuff.
id="t-197000"&&And it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.
id="t-201000"&&He sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.
id="t-205000"&&The thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic.
id="t-205000"&&The thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic.

id="t-217000"&&And it was just, it was a magical place.
id="t-217000"&&And it was just, it was a magical place.
id="t-217000"&&And it was just, it was a magical place.

id="t-225000"&&Which is good, but now I can't move.
id="t-227000"&&Now, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.
id="t-227000"&&Now, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.
id="t-227000"&&Now, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.
id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-232000"&&Anyway, so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this: Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.
id="t-240000"&&The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following: 15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.
id="t-240000"&&The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following: 15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.
id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) Now, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.
id="t-252000"&&If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.
id="t-255000"&&But I've had this forever.
id="t-258000"&&Now, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf, and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?
id="t-258000"&&Now, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf, and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?

id="t-258000"&&Now, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf, and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?
id="t-271000"&&And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow, in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before, and bored people elsewhere.
id="t-271000"&&And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow, in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before, and bored people elsewhere.

id="t-287000"&&And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important -- to me.
id="t-287000"&&And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important -- to me.

id="t-287000"&&And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important -- to me.
id="t-311000"&&And what I love about this box, and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do, is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility, that sense of potential.
id="t-324000"&&And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.
id="t-327000"&&Now, it's not the most ground-breaking idea, but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge, I started getting interested in this. 

id="t-336000"&&And so I started thinking about "Lost," and the stuff that we do, and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!
id="t-342000"&&In how -- in the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I, who created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do.
id="t-342000"&&In how -- in the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I, who created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do.

id="t-362000"&&There was no time to develop it.
id="t-363000"&&I'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change.
id="t-367000"&&And there was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.
id="t-370000"&&And so we did this show, and for those of you who, you know, who haven't seen it, or don't know it, I can show you this one little clip from the pilot, just to show you some stuff that we did.

id="t-435000"&&We'd actually -- (Laughter) it would be harder.
id="t-444000"&&So the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.
id="t-448000"&&And part of that was the amazing availability of technology, knowing we could do anything.
id="t-448000"&&And part of that was the amazing availability of technology, knowing we could do anything.

id="t-463000"&&I realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?
id="t-467000"&&It needs to be filled with something fantastic. 

id="t-469000"&&I used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.
id="t-471000"&&The romance of the script was amazing to me; it would inspire me.
id="t-474000"&&I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did.
id="t-474000"&&I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did.
id="t-474000"&&I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did.

id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) It's huge!
id="t-22000"&&(Laughter) It's huge!

id="t-536000"&&So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.
id="t-542000"&&Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information.
id="t-542000"&&Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information.
id="t-552000"&&Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" -- if Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked, it would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.
id="t-559000"&&In "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!
id="t-562000"&&Even in a movie, like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate," they're having that date, remember?
id="t-567000"&&And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.
id="t-567000"&&And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.

id="t-567000"&&And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.
id="t-577000"&&So to me, there's that. 

id="t-579000"&&And then, finally, there's this idea -- stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit -- but the idea of the mystery box.
id="t-585000"&&Meaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.
id="t-588000"&&And it's true in so many movies and stories.
id="t-588000"&&And it's true in so many movies and stories.

id="t-607000"&&It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.
id="t-609000"&&He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.
id="t-611000"&&There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time, but pretty great scenes.
id="t-617000"&&There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you're, you know, expecting. 

id="t-622000"&&When you look at a movie like "Jaws," the scene that you expect -- we have the screen?
id="t-626000"&&These are the kind of, you know, scenes that you remember and expect from "Jaws."
id="t-630000"&&And she's being eaten; there's a shark.
id="t-635000"&&The thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity, with his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.
id="t-644000"&&This is one of my favorite scenes ever, and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of "Jaws."
id="t-649000"&&But it's an amazing scene.

id="t-737000"&&You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.
id="t-739000"&&You gotta rip off -- you know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character.

id="t-756000"&&The moment the lights go down is often the best part, you know?
id="t-759000"&&And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation.
id="t-765000"&&And often, the movie's, like, there and it's going, and then something happens and you go, "Oh--" and then something else, and you're, "Mmm ..." Now, when it's a great movie, you're along for the ride 'cause you're willing to give yourself to it.

id="t-859000"&&And so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.
id="t-862000"&&And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced, you know -- who have been silenced in the past -- it's a very exciting thing. 

id="t-871000"&&I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff, to someone who wants to write, "Go!

id="t-883000"&&You can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf that is either as good, or just as good, as the stuff that's being used by the, you know, quote unquote "legit people."
id="t-894000"&&No community is best served when only the elite have control.
id="t-898000"&&And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there. 

id="t-901000"&&When I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects stuff.
id="t-904000"&&ILM did the effects; it was incredible.
id="t-906000"&&And sort of like my dream to be involved.
id="t-908000"&&And there are a couple of sequences in the movie, like these couple of moments I'll show you.
id="t-919000"&&There's that. 

id="t-940000"&&Okay, obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.
id="t-943000"&&So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.

id="t-987000"&&So Eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet English guy.
id="t-987000"&&So Eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet English guy.
id="t-992000"&&I'm like -- you gotta -- we have to make this look good.
id="t-994000"&&And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was.
id="t-997000"&&And I literally, like, thought back to what I would have done using the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room, and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.

id="t-1011000"&&So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.
id="t-1014000"&&We put it in Eddie's sleeve, and so the hand that you see -- I'll show you again, that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.
