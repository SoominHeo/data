id="t-0"&&So I thought, "I will talk about death."
id="t-2000"&&Seemed to be the passion today.
id="t-4000"&&Actually, it's not about death.
id="t-6000"&&It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
id="t-12000"&&That's what I want to talk about. 

id="t-14000"&&So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi!
id="t-14000"&&So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi!
id="t-24000"&&And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.
id="t-36000"&&And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
id="t-42000"&&In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
id="t-50000"&&He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. 

id="t-63000"&&After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
id="t-68000"&&Handwriting is a disappearing art.
id="t-71000"&&I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?
id="t-77000"&&Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
id="t-81000"&&There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.
id="t-97000"&&But too late.
id="t-99000"&&But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him. 

id="t-111000"&&So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
id="t-118000"&&A value for things with a personal touch -- an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.
id="t-125000"&&If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. 

id="t-141000"&&So what do I plan to leave for my son?
id="t-145000"&&I collect autographed books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.
id="t-152000"&&I plan to publish my own notebook.
id="t-156000"&&As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
id="t-164000"&&I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son. 

id="t-172000"&&I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.
id="t-176000"&&And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
id="t-181000"&&I took it out for the first time to come here.
id="t-184000"&&"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up.
id="t-197000"&&I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me.
id="t-219000"&&Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."
id="t-230000"&&Thank you.
