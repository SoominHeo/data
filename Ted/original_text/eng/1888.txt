id="t-17000"&&During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides, and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old, we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq.
id="t-37000"&&This has led to a common understanding of our situation, namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril. 

id="t-47000"&&Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems, community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown, crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter."

id="t-303000"&&Well, let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.
id="t-309000"&&Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times, we know just from conventional history -- the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence. 

id="t-325000"&&For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment.

id="t-342000"&&There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment: burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel, being pulled apart by horses and so on.
id="t-353000"&&The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes: criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread.

id="t-392000"&&The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county that he could find, and he supplemented them with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.
id="t-410000"&&He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages.

id="t-445000"&&But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present, and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century. 

id="t-457000"&&Let's click down now to the decade scale.
id="t-459000"&&According to non-governmental organizations that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas, there has been a steep decline in interstate wars, in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups, even in South America.

id="t-505000"&&Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars, fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs -- and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.

id="t-732000"&&Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought, and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first. 

id="t-742000"&&Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.
id="t-745000"&&You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.

id="t-826000"&&Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires, frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on. 

id="t-840000"&&The second explanation is that in many times and places, there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
id="t-847000"&&In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others.

id="t-863000"&&This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.

id="t-542000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-929000"&&The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own.

id="t-1016000"&&It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories, and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel, and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human, and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."
