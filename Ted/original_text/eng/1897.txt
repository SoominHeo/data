id="t-1000"&&Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa.
id="t-9000"&&The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership.
id="t-13000"&&Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
id="t-18000"&&And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent.
id="t-28000"&&I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
id="t-33000"&&We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
id="t-37000"&&An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana, and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach.
id="t-51000"&&Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital.
id="t-59000"&&The emergency generators did not start.
id="t-62000"&&There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle -- pitch black.
id="t-68000"&&The patient's cut open, twice.
id="t-73000"&&The first time it was a C-section.
id="t-77000"&&Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived. 

id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-82000"&&The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
id="t-101000"&&And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
id="t-105000"&&They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
id="t-109000"&&And it happened twice.
id="t-111000"&&Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
id="t-123000"&&And so three months later, just before she returned to the United States, nurses in Accra go on strike.
id="t-130000"&&And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
id="t-137000"&&Start all over again. 

id="t-139000"&&Now what does this have to do with leadership?
id="t-144000"&&You see, the folks at the ministry of health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school.
id="t-144000"&&You see, the folks at the ministry of health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school.
id="t-144000"&&You see, the folks at the ministry of health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school.
id="t-167000"&&Their decisions, their actions matter.
id="t-170000"&&And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
id="t-175000"&&So when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leaders.
id="t-181000"&&We've heard a lot about that.
id="t-183000"&&I'm talking about the elite.
id="t-187000"&&Those who've been trained, whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
id="t-194000"&&The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants -- those are the leaders.
id="t-204000"&&And we need to train them right. 

id="t-207000"&&Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old.
id="t-215000"&&We had just had a military coup, and soldiers were pervasive in our society.
id="t-220000"&&They were a pervasive presence.
id="t-222000"&&And one day I go to the airport to meet my father, and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building, I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
id="t-236000"&&And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment.
id="t-236000"&&And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment.
id="t-236000"&&And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment.
id="t-250000"&&No sign to this effect. 

Now, I was 16.
Now, I was 16.
id="t-261000"&&I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
id="t-266000"&&And so I started to argue with these men.
id="t-268000"&&It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
id="t-270000"&&I got lucky.
id="t-272000"&&A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
id="t-276000"&&Because of his uniform they speak to him differently, and they explain to him that they're just following orders.
id="t-281000"&&So he takes their radio, talks to their boss, and gets us all released.
id="t-286000"&&What lessons would you take from an experience like this?
id="t-289000"&&Several, for me.
id="t-289000"&&Several, for me.
id="t-289000"&&Several, for me.
id="t-298000"&&I learned something about courage.
id="t-300000"&&It was important not to look at those guns.
id="t-304000"&&And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls. 

id="t-308000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-310000"&&So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education.
id="t-319000"&&It was a breath of fresh air.
id="t-322000"&&You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
id="t-331000"&&They wanted us to think critically.
id="t-333000"&&They wanted us to be analytical.
id="t-335000"&&They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
id="t-339000"&&In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics.
id="t-345000"&&But I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy -- were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
id="t-362000"&&And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
id="t-365000"&&It matters a great deal. 

id="t-368000"&&But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
id="t-372000"&&I had an inkling, but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
id="t-383000"&&And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world.
id="t-396000"&&And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
id="t-399000"&&It was brilliant.
id="t-401000"&&And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation -- the ability to confront problems, complex problems, and to design solutions to those problems.
id="t-415000"&&The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual.
id="t-421000"&&And I was part of that. 

id="t-424000"&&Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
id="t-434000"&&And by the way, it's continued to.
id="t-437000"&&The gap has widened since I left.
id="t-441000"&&Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
id="t-445000"&&I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking, persistent, creative, empowered.
id="t-454000"&&But there were also some external factors: free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
id="t-462000"&&These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders.
id="t-470000"&&And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
id="t-473000"&&Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.
id="t-478000"&&Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
id="t-480000"&&I became a parent.
id="t-482000"&&And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
id="t-487000"&&Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children.
id="t-495000"&&That the state of the world -- the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa, as far as my kids would be concerned. 

id="t-508000"&&And at this time, when I was going through what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis," Africa was a mess.
id="t-518000"&&Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
id="t-520000"&&Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
id="t-524000"&&And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction, and I needed to be back helping.
id="t-529000"&&I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
id="t-537000"&&This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
id="t-543000"&&So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were.
id="t-555000"&&And three things kept coming up for every problem: corruption, weak institutions and the people who run them -- the leaders. 

id="t-567000"&&Now, I was a little scared because when you see those three problems, they seem really hard to deal with.
id="t-574000"&&And they might say, "Look, don't even try."
id="t-576000"&&But, for me, I asked the question, "Well, where are these leaders coming from?
id="t-583000"&&What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
id="t-591000"&&So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
id="t-594000"&&And it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school.
id="t-600000"&&Very little emphasis on ethics, and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
id="t-617000"&&This is wrong. 

id="t-619000"&&So I decided to engage this particular problem.
id="t-624000"&&Because it seems to me that every society, every society, must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
id="t-634000"&&And Ghana was not paying enough attention.
id="t-637000"&&And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
id="t-644000"&&So this is what I'm doing now.
id="t-646000"&&I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
id="t-653000"&&I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
id="t-657000"&&I think it would make a huge difference.
id="t-660000"&&And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
id="t-672000"&&We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity, who have the ability to confront the complex problems, ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions. 

id="t-684000"&&I'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible," but we must believe that these kids are smart.
id="t-695000"&&That if we involve them in their education, if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront -- that our whole society confronts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world, that magic will happen.
id="t-716000"&&Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
id="t-724000"&&And a month into it, I come to the office, and I have this email from one of our students.
id="t-730000"&&And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
id="t-735000"&&And he signs off, "Thank you."
id="t-740000"&&It's such a simple statement.
id="t-743000"&&But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man.
id="t-750000"&&And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way.
id="t-759000"&&I am thinking now. 

id="t-763000"&&This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves.
id="t-770000"&&There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like.
id="t-779000"&&One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
id="t-783000"&&Can we create a perfect society?
id="t-789000"&&Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
id="t-801000"&&Now, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
id="t-809000"&&I don't know ultimately what they will do.
id="t-811000"&&I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
id="t-815000"&&But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like, what their excellent society should look like, is a really good thing. 

Am I out of time?
Am I out of time?
id="t-845000"&&I'm very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
id="t-854000"&&That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
id="t-859000"&&These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership, the real privilege of leadership, which is after all to serve humanity.
id="t-876000"&&I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government.
id="t-887000"&&It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university.
id="t-897000"&&It says a lot about her.
id="t-899000"&&It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
id="t-904000"&&It says a lot about her peers who elected her.
id="t-907000"&&She won with 75 percent of the vote. 

id="t-913000"&&And it gives me a lot of hope.
id="t-916000"&&It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students.
id="t-923000"&&We've graduated two classes of students to date.
id="t-927000"&&And every single one of them has been placed.
id="t-930000"&&And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa, and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
id="t-941000"&&You know, that passion for what they're doing.
id="t-945000"&&The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity, their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
id="t-955000"&&This is good because over the past five years, there have been times when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."

id="t-965000"&&And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
id="t-975000"&&I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent.
id="t-985000"&&It's an incredible opportunity.
id="t-987000"&&There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
id="t-991000"&&I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
id="t-1003000"&&We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation.
id="t-1010000"&&It will depend on inspired leadership.
id="t-18000"&&And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference.
id="t-1022000"&&Thank you, and God bless. 

id="t-1024000"&&(Applause)
