id="t-3000"&&Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it? 

id="t-5000"&&Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.
id="t-7000"&&Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair. 

id="t-9000"&&AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.
id="t-11000"&&I mean I'm nervous enough as it is. 

id="t-14000"&&But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
id="t-18000"&&Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
id="t-21000"&&Do you know that surgery?
id="t-23000"&&Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
id="t-30000"&&Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty. 

id="t-34000"&&Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it.
id="t-38000"&&But first you need to know two things about me.
id="t-40000"&&Just two things.
id="t-42000"&&I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
id="t-45000"&&Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
id="t-47000"&&That means we get our new hips for free.
id="t-49000"&&And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything.
id="t-49000"&&And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything.

id="t-57000"&&So my hip had been hurting me for years.
id="t-59000"&&I finally went to the doctor, which was free.
id="t-62000"&&And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
id="t-66000"&&Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.
id="t-70000"&&That is what free gets you.
id="t-74000"&&I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them.
id="t-74000"&&I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them.
id="t-83000"&&So he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.
id="t-87000"&&I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait."
id="t-90000"&&18 more months.
id="t-92000"&&I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months. 

id="t-96000"&&You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
id="t-100000"&&I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
id="t-102000"&&I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
id="t-105000"&&I would not have my new hip for TED2008.
id="t-105000"&&I would not have my new hip for TED2008.
id="t-105000"&&I would not have my new hip for TED2008.

id="t-110000"&&So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany.
id="t-117000"&&This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
id="t-121000"&&Oh yeah. 

id="t-123000"&&Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?
id="t-125000"&&We do not think that way.
id="t-125000"&&We do not think that way.
id="t-125000"&&We do not think that way.
id="t-130000"&&In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
id="t-130000"&&In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.

id="t-130000"&&In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.

id="t-141000"&&So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
id="t-145000"&&Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening.
id="t-145000"&&Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening.
id="t-145000"&&Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening.

id="t-151000"&&So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
id="t-157000"&&And I saw a sign.
id="t-160000"&&In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, "Volunteers Needed."
id="t-160000"&&In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, "Volunteers Needed."
id="t-168000"&&Well, they signed me up immediately.
id="t-168000"&&Well, they signed me up immediately.
id="t-168000"&&Well, they signed me up immediately.
id="t-174000"&&They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
id="t-174000"&&They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
id="t-174000"&&They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.

id="t-183000"&&So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
id="t-190000"&&I worked alone.
id="t-192000"&&Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
id="t-195000"&&While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"
id="t-200000"&&Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
id="t-200000"&&Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
id="t-200000"&&Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
id="t-211000"&&All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer. 

id="t-218000"&&My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop.
id="t-223000"&&So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
id="t-227000"&&I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
id="t-229000"&&And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them.
id="t-233000"&&Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet. 

id="t-242000"&&Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
id="t-246000"&&And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
id="t-249000"&&Two reasons.
id="t-250000"&&First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
id="t-252000"&&But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
id="t-259000"&&Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.
