id="t-0"&&What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
id="t-12000"&&What does this all mean for us?
id="t-14000"&&What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
id="t-19000"&&It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world.
id="t-26000"&&With graphics, computing power, low latencies, these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives.
id="t-37000"&&So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor. 

id="t-48000"&&When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites.
id="t-54000"&&As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings, the Web matching, the index crawling.
id="t-60000"&&But we want to use our brain!
id="t-62000"&&We want to navigate, explore, discover information.
id="t-65000"&&In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.
id="t-70000"&&We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer. 

id="t-74000"&&So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?
id="t-81000"&&Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
id="t-85000"&&So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
id="t-93000"&&What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
id="t-93000"&&What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
id="t-93000"&&What we want to do is mix in all types of data.

id="t-93000"&&What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
id="t-104000"&&So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking.
id="t-104000"&&So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking.
id="t-110000"&&Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people.
id="t-117000"&&This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem. 

id="t-126000"&&Here is an example of our aerial camera.
id="t-126000"&&Here is an example of our aerial camera.
id="t-126000"&&Here is an example of our aerial camera.
id="t-131000"&&In addition, it's multi-spectral.
id="t-133000"&&We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
id="t-139000"&&That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.
id="t-145000"&&We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
id="t-145000"&&We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
id="t-145000"&&We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
id="t-145000"&&We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.

id="t-158000"&&We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person?
id="t-158000"&&We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person?
id="t-168000"&&I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials, kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.
id="t-178000"&&So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
id="t-178000"&&So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
id="t-178000"&&So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
id="t-178000"&&So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
id="t-188000"&&Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
id="t-188000"&&Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
id="t-188000"&&Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
id="t-197000"&&But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job. 

id="t-199000"&&We think a lot of good can come from this technology.
id="t-199000"&&We think a lot of good can come from this technology.

id="t-199000"&&We think a lot of good can come from this technology.
id="t-218000"&&Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.
id="t-223000"&&We made it all freely available on the Web, just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. 

id="t-229000"&&When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math.
id="t-236000"&&You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning.
id="t-236000"&&You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning.

id="t-236000"&&You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning.
id="t-246000"&&Extract geometry from the images.
id="t-249000"&&This process is a very calculated process.
id="t-253000"&&In fact, it was always done manual.
id="t-254000"&&Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
id="t-261000"&&They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
id="t-261000"&&They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
id="t-261000"&&They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
id="t-267000"&&We do this all through software, algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
id="t-272000"&&We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. 

id="t-279000"&&We think about the user interface.
id="t-281000"&&What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
id="t-281000"&&What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
id="t-281000"&&What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
id="t-293000"&&I'll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.
id="t-299000"&&What we're doing is -- people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with.
id="t-299000"&&What we're doing is -- people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with.
id="t-305000"&&But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.
id="t-309000"&&A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller. 

id="t-313000"&&So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.
id="t-313000"&&So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.

id="t-335000"&&I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. 

id="t-338000"&&What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
id="t-341000"&&We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with, and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.
id="t-350000"&&I thank you very much for your time.
id="t-352000"&&(Applause)
