id="t-809"&&A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails.
id="t-5468"&&And it managed to get through my spam filter.
id="t-7596"&&I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-14159"&&I know. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-16588"&&It went like this: it said, "Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."
id="t-24246"&&Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?
id="t-24246"&&Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?
id="t-24246"&&Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?
id="t-30442"&&Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-38541"&&And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-48500"&&And the game was afoot. 

id="t-53214"&&He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-58302"&&"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-63307"&&So I knew I was dealing with a professional. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-70408"&&I said, "How much is it worth?"

id="t-73058"&&He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, "of 25 kgs. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-82969"&&The worth should be about $2.5 million."

id="t-87536"&&I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big. 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

I can handle it.
I can handle it.

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-105761"&&He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling.
id="t-110460"&&We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."

id="t-112707"&&I said, "50 kgs?
id="t-114602"&&There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-123401"&&He said, "What do you do for a living?"

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-128283"&&I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-135243"&&This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no. 

id="t-140989"&&Then I started to panic.
id="t-142164"&&I was like, "Where are you based?"
id="t-143816"&&I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for.
id="t-148746"&&That's a lot of gold."

id="t-150666"&&He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment."

id="t-154861"&&I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.
id="t-157413"&&I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.
id="t-160883"&&Hold tight."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-169009"&&This is what I sent Solomon. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-179829"&&I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-187170"&&I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.
id="t-191281"&&I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-195408"&&We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."

id="t-198254"&&There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon.
id="t-202695"&&He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."
id="t-208045"&&And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"
id="t-211363"&&And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"

id="t-214133"&&I thought about it for a long time.
id="t-218925"&&And I said, "One word; Hummus."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-228261"&&"It's going places. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-231395"&&I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties.
id="t-235142"&&Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.
id="t-238063"&&Have you ever done that, Solomon?"

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-242458"&&He said, "I have to go bed now."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-249800"&&"Till morrow.
id="t-252407"&&Have sweet dream."

id="t-253583"&&I didn't know what to say!
id="t-255643"&&I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-261323"&&Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head.
id="t-268325"&&It was getting a bit out of hand.
id="t-269929"&&Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"
id="t-272905"&&I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."

id="t-275945"&&So I figured I had to knock it on the head.
id="t-278013"&&I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.
id="t-280093"&&So I concocted a plan.
id="t-281269"&&I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.
id="t-283645"&&When we email each other, we need to use a code."
id="t-288582"&&And he agreed. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-291169"&&I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: 

id="t-296211"&&Lawyer: Gummy Bear. 

id="t-301564"&&Bank: Cream Egg. 

Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.

id="t-306193"&&Documents: Jelly Beans. 

id="t-308137"&&Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-312602"&&I knew these were all words they use, right?
id="t-314962"&&I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

I didn't hear back.
I didn't hear back.
I didn't hear back.
I didn't hear back.
id="t-328820"&&I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?
id="t-332311"&&KitKat."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-334756"&&Because you have to be consistent.
id="t-339208"&&Then I did get an email back from him.
id="t-341098"&&He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..." 

id="t-344302"&&I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"
id="t-349478"&&What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-355675"&&I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.
id="t-358939"&&This was a good day.
id="t-361224"&&"The business is on.
id="t-364065"&&I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear -- 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-371485"&&so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-381940"&&Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard."

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-397392"&&And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could?
id="t-408145"&&And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

id="t-420079"&&Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.
id="t-422974"&&It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it.
id="t-425751"&&I don't think what I'm doing is mean.
id="t-427616"&&There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.
id="t-430392"&&All I'm doing is wasting their time.
id="t-434894"&&And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right? 

id="t-441584"&&And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address.
id="t-447206"&&Don't use your own email address.
id="t-448834"&&That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.
id="t-451712"&&I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response -- 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-459864"&&to a medical question I had. 

id="t-461230"&&But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-472396"&&"I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."
id="t-472396"&&"I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."
id="t-472396"&&"I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-481444"&&I know so many. 

id="t-483546"&&"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."

id="t-489420"&&Let that sink in.
id="t-491864"&&She sent me this, which is hysterical. 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-497499"&&And this.
id="t-498682"&&And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.
id="t-501905"&&But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape! 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-507651"&&I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.
id="t-510017"&&Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-517482"&&That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive. 

id="t-523373"&&She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
id="t-526168"&&ONE LOVE."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

I said, "Of course.
I said, "Of course.

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause) 

She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS.
id="t-526168"&&ONE LOVE."

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-548010"&&I said, "no problemo. 

id="t-552422"&&I SHOT THE SHERIFF."

id="t-557813"&&[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] 

id="t-12349"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-560766"&&Thank you. 

id="t-43500"&&(Applause)
