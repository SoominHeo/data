id="t-105000"&&♫ We secretly play Beethoven ♫ 

♫ inside our bassmobiles.

id="t-134000"&&♫ Black men now are students ♫ 

♫ of gay sensibility.

id="t-145000"&&♫ We get baptized in Walden Pond ♫ 

id="t-148000"&&♫ amongst a searing mob ♫

♫ could not do a thorough job.

id="t-167000"&&♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫ 

♫ and Germans cook soul food.
