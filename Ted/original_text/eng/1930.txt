id="t-0"&&This song is one of Thomas' favorites, called "What You Do with What You've Got."

id="t-21000"&&♫ You must know someone like him ♫ 

id="t-24000"&&♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫ 

id="t-27000"&&♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫ 

id="t-30000"&&♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫ 

id="t-34000"&&♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫ 

id="t-37000"&&♫ grew twisted around itself ♫ 

id="t-40000"&&♫ Till almost everything he did ♫ 

id="t-43000"&&♫ brought pain to someone else ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ It's not just what you're born with ♫ 

id="t-53000"&&♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫ 

id="t-56000"&&♫ It's not how big your share is ♫ 

id="t-60000"&&♫ It's how much you can share ♫ 

id="t-63000"&&♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫ 

id="t-66000"&&♫ It's those you really fought ♫ 

id="t-69000"&&♫ It's not what you've been given ♫ 

id="t-72000"&&♫ It's what you do with what you've got ♫ 

id="t-80000"&&♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫ 

♫ if you only run away?
♫ if you only run away?

id="t-87000"&&♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫ 

♫ if you've nothing good to say?
♫ if you've nothing good to say?

id="t-93000"&&♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫ 

♫ if you only push and shove?
♫ if you only push and shove?

id="t-100000"&&♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫ 

♫ if you can't hear those you love?
♫ if you can't hear those you love?

id="t-80000"&&♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫ 

♫ if you only run away?
♫ if you only run away?

id="t-87000"&&♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫ 

♫ if you've nothing good to say?
♫ if you've nothing good to say?

id="t-93000"&&♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫ 

♫ if you only push and shove?
♫ if you only push and shove?

id="t-100000"&&♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫ 

♫ if you can't hear those you love?
♫ if you can't hear those you love?

id="t-192000"&&♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫ 

id="t-195000"&&♫ and those who use the cane ♫ 

id="t-198000"&&♫ Between those in constant power ♫ 

id="t-201000"&&♫ and those in constant pain ♫ 

id="t-204000"&&♫ Between those who run to glory ♫ 

id="t-207000"&&♫ and those who cannot run ♫ 

id="t-210000"&&♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫ 

id="t-213000"&&♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫ 

id="t-250000"&&♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫ 

id="t-250000"&&♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫ 

id="t-280000"&&(Applause) Thank you very much.
