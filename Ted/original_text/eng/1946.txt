id="t-0"&&I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder: "I find no peace, and all my war is done; I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice; I fly above the wind, and yet I cannot arise; And naught I have, and all the world I seize upon."

id="t-46000"&&♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-65000"&&♫ Have but I don't have ♫ 

id="t-66000"&&♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫ 

id="t-68000"&&♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫ 

id="t-70000"&&♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫ 

id="t-72000"&&♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫ 

id="t-46000"&&♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-65000"&&♫ Have but I don't have ♫ 

id="t-86000"&&♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫ 

id="t-89000"&&♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫ 

id="t-94000"&&♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫ 

id="t-97000"&&♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫ 

id="t-101000"&&♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫ 

id="t-104000"&&♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫ 

id="t-108000"&&♫ Stand the cold air ♫ 

id="t-111000"&&♫ Glad-handed ♫ 

id="t-113000"&&♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫ 

id="t-117000"&&♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫ 

id="t-121000"&&♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫ 

id="t-123000"&&♫ I gotta just name it ♫ 

id="t-125000"&&♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫ 

id="t-128000"&&♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫ 

id="t-130000"&&♫ My mind won't stop ♫ 

id="t-132000"&&♫ And my heart says go ♫ 

id="t-89000"&&♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫ 

id="t-138000"&&♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫ 

id="t-160000"&&♫ Good things must be here -- yes, right here ♫ 

id="t-165000"&&♫ Here, right here, right here ♫ 

id="t-168000"&&♫ I won't live this life forever ♫ 

id="t-173000"&&♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫ 

id="t-113000"&&♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫ 

id="t-181000"&&♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫ 

id="t-185000"&&♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫ 

id="t-188000"&&♫ I gotta just seize ♫ 

id="t-190000"&&♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫ 

id="t-46000"&&♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-48000"&&♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ 

id="t-50000"&&♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ 

id="t-200000"&&♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫ 

id="t-86000"&&♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫ 

id="t-206000"&&♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫ 

id="t-86000"&&♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫ 

id="t-215000"&&♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
