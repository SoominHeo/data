Hello.
Hello.
id="t-8000"&&One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
id="t-27000"&&And how do you bring those two things together?
id="t-29000"&&Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.
id="t-37000"&&And that's what I want to talk about today.
id="t-40000"&&So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo. 

id="t-54000"&&I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
id="t-58000"&&Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them.
id="t-58000"&&Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them.
id="t-58000"&&Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them.
id="t-71000"&&And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.
id="t-75000"&&We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.
id="t-83000"&&And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff.
id="t-95000"&&Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever. 

id="t-103000"&&The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
id="t-109000"&&I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
id="t-113000"&&This is 59 seconds into the film.
id="t-119000"&&This is a minute 59.
id="t-124000"&&3:19.
id="t-124000"&&3:19.
id="t-124000"&&3:19.
id="t-129000"&&5:10.
id="t-131000"&&5:58.
id="t-133000"&&6:20.
id="t-135000"&&We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?
id="t-139000"&&And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
id="t-154000"&&And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- 

id="t-158000"&&this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
id="t-160000"&&He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
id="t-165000"&&That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
id="t-168000"&&And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
id="t-168000"&&And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
id="t-168000"&&And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
id="t-184000"&&And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
id="t-188000"&&So they snapped into action.
id="t-189000"&&They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
id="t-192000"&&It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
id="t-194000"&&It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference. 

id="t-197000"&&So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
id="t-203000"&&The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
id="t-217000"&&You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.
id="t-222000"&&Very small example of something that they could do.
id="t-225000"&&Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this.
id="t-225000"&&Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this.
id="t-231000"&&The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
id="t-234000"&&Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
id="t-236000"&&I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
id="t-239000"&&It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
id="t-242000"&&Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
id="t-252000"&&Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room.
id="t-252000"&&Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room.

id="t-264000"&&So you went from public space to private space.
id="t-266000"&&And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.
id="t-277000"&&So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.
id="t-284000"&&So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
id="t-289000"&&I thought that was a really, really nice example. 

id="t-293000"&&So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.
id="t-301000"&&It's a history of invention based around this.
id="t-304000"&&I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
id="t-306000"&&Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.
id="t-319000"&&Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.
id="t-328000"&&And he invented the shipping container.
id="t-331000"&&George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro. 

id="t-345000"&&And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
id="t-356000"&&So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
id="t-365000"&&Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."
id="t-376000"&&Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
id="t-380000"&&So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity. 

id="t-386000"&&Again, another medical example here.
id="t-389000"&&We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
id="t-394000"&&We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.
id="t-401000"&&This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
id="t-405000"&&They'll ask the nurses to input data.
id="t-407000"&&And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
id="t-415000"&&When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.
id="t-428000"&&When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
id="t-440000"&&And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them.
id="t-440000"&&And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them.

id="t-454000"&&So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.
id="t-463000"&&So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
id="t-468000"&&So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.
id="t-477000"&&And I think that's really, really important.
id="t-480000"&&So, again, this idea of workarounds.
id="t-482000"&&We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us.
id="t-482000"&&We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us.
id="t-489000"&&This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot. 

id="t-500000"&&We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
id="t-504000"&&It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
id="t-510000"&&Why do we all follow the line in the street?
id="t-513000"&&This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
id="t-515000"&&People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
id="t-521000"&&Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
id="t-525000"&&Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
id="t-529000"&&We don't know why, but we do.
id="t-533000"&&Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
id="t-536000"&&Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
id="t-541000"&&And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
id="t-541000"&&And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
id="t-541000"&&And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
id="t-546000"&&This is people designing their own experiences.
id="t-548000"&&You can draw from this.
id="t-552000"&&We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
id="t-559000"&&It's there for our use, on some level. 

id="t-561000"&&So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
id="t-566000"&&We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
id="t-566000"&&We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
id="t-566000"&&We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
id="t-566000"&&We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
id="t-566000"&&We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
id="t-578000"&&So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.
id="t-584000"&&And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
id="t-587000"&&I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
id="t-590000"&&And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
id="t-592000"&&We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
id="t-598000"&&Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.
id="t-604000"&&I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
id="t-607000"&&Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh. 

id="t-611000"&&A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
id="t-619000"&&This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
id="t-619000"&&This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
id="t-619000"&&This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
id="t-619000"&&This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
id="t-619000"&&This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
id="t-632000"&&The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
id="t-638000"&&Children assume permission in a very different way.
id="t-638000"&&Children assume permission in a very different way.
id="t-638000"&&Children assume permission in a very different way.
id="t-643000"&&They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.
id="t-650000"&&So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes.
id="t-650000"&&So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes.
id="t-658000"&&So, what came out of this?
id="t-660000"&&This is the storage system that he designed.
id="t-660000"&&This is the storage system that he designed.
id="t-660000"&&This is the storage system that he designed.
id="t-660000"&&This is the storage system that he designed.

id="t-666000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-668000"&&It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
id="t-672000"&&So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
id="t-675000"&&It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it. 

id="t-666000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-685000"&&But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.
id="t-691000"&&And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
id="t-700000"&&And then use that information to fuel solutions?
id="t-703000"&&And I think that's what this is very much about.
id="t-703000"&&And I think that's what this is very much about.
id="t-703000"&&And I think that's what this is very much about.
id="t-711000"&&It's about this really.
id="t-713000"&&I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
id="t-717000"&&Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start?
id="t-717000"&&Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start?
id="t-717000"&&Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start?
id="t-725000"&&So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
id="t-731000"&&They're now called KickStart. 

id="t-734000"&&And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
id="t-740000"&&And that was completely irrelevant.
id="t-741000"&&When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it.
id="t-741000"&&When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it.
id="t-758000"&&So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
id="t-762000"&&We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
id="t-766000"&&So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.
id="t-771000"&&It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
id="t-771000"&&It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
id="t-771000"&&It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
id="t-771000"&&It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
id="t-777000"&&It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs. 

id="t-783000"&&These guys are using this very successfully.
id="t-785000"&&And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
id="t-787000"&&So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
id="t-799000"&&There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
id="t-803000"&&So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.
id="t-809000"&&We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
id="t-816000"&&Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
id="t-820000"&&We feel that this is an important gesture.
id="t-820000"&&We feel that this is an important gesture.
id="t-820000"&&We feel that this is an important gesture.
id="t-824000"&&I hope you'll all wear them.
id="t-824000"&&I hope you'll all wear them.
id="t-824000"&&I hope you'll all wear them.

id="t-828000"&&(Applause)
