id="t-0"&&I was asked to come here and speak about creation.
id="t-3000"&&And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.
id="t-7000"&&And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation, which I call "creativity."
id="t-17000"&&Creativity is how we cope with creation.
id="t-21000"&&While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless, creativity is always meaningful.
id="t-30000"&&See, for instance, in this picture.
id="t-31000"&&You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. 

id="t-40000"&&When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.
id="t-46000"&&You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
id="t-49000"&&I just did things.
id="t-52000"&&Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was, and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.
id="t-58000"&&It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly -- looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties -- they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.
id="t-74000"&&Though it's actually true, you know, the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
id="t-81000"&&If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil. 

id="t-87000"&&You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a semiotic black market.
id="t-98000"&&You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it.
id="t-103000"&&You didn't trust information very much.
id="t-105000"&&That led me to another step of why I'm here today, is because I really liked media of all kinds.
id="t-111000"&&I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.
id="t-115000"&&My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards, and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.
id="t-126000"&&It was very -- actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency.
id="t-131000"&&And they also decided that I had to -- to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it. 

id="t-139000"&&And another point -- why I'm here -- is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy, I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life, picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.
id="t-150000"&&On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
id="t-153000"&&Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
id="t-153000"&&Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
id="t-153000"&&Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
id="t-158000"&&And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) -- and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun -- I don't know why he had a gun -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.
id="t-158000"&&And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) -- and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun -- I don't know why he had a gun -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.

id="t-181000"&&Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
id="t-184000"&&And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.
id="t-193000"&&And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot.
id="t-193000"&&And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot.

id="t-206000"&&Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.
id="t-214000"&&You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.
id="t-218000"&&Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do.
id="t-218000"&&Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do.
id="t-233000"&&But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
id="t-237000"&&The first works were actually objects.
id="t-239000"&&It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.
id="t-244000"&&And I called them relics.
id="t-246000"&&They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983. 

id="t-250000"&&This is the clown skull.
id="t-252000"&&Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.
id="t-252000"&&Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.

id="t-261000"&&Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
id="t-266000"&&A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
id="t-266000"&&A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.

id="t-289000"&&The Bonsai table.
id="t-295000"&&The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.
id="t-305000"&&And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet. 

id="t-311000"&&I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
id="t-319000"&&So I decided to do work with clouds.
id="t-321000"&&Because clouds can mean anything you want.
id="t-324000"&&But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way, so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands -- although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
id="t-338000"&&But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.
id="t-342000"&&They're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.
id="t-347000"&&"The Snail."
id="t-348000"&&But I was still working with sculpture, and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.
id="t-353000"&&"The Teapot."

id="t-355000"&&I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94, and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."
id="t-362000"&&And he did something that was very tricky.
id="t-365000"&&He put together two different media from different periods of time.
id="t-368000"&&First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief, and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.
id="t-378000"&&And it's totally overkill.
id="t-381000"&&And your eye doesn't know which level to read.
id="t-383000"&&And you become trapped into this kind of representation.
id="t-386000"&&So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.
id="t-397000"&&The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?
id="t-403000"&&And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."
id="t-405000"&&Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.
id="t-409000"&&It had a physicality, and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way, towards the image.
id="t-409000"&&It had a physicality, and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way, towards the image.
id="t-423000"&&"Relaxation."
id="t-425000"&&"Fiat Lux."

id="t-429000"&&And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
id="t-435000"&&And I wanted to deal with other subjects.
id="t-437000"&&I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.
id="t-444000"&&I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread," and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.
id="t-450000"&&These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case.
id="t-454000"&&So this is a lighthouse.
id="t-454000"&&So this is a lighthouse.
id="t-454000"&&So this is a lighthouse.
id="t-468000"&&And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable. 

id="t-474000"&&Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points, like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.
id="t-482000"&&I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and I did work and play with them.
id="t-490000"&&I got some photographs from them.
id="t-492000"&&Upon my arrival in New York, I decided -- they were children of sugar plantation workers.
id="t-498000"&&And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.
id="t-503000"&&These are -- (Applause) -- Thank you.
id="t-503000"&&These are -- (Applause) -- Thank you.
id="t-511000"&&It was just the name of the child, with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
id="t-517000"&&"Valicia."
id="t-521000"&&"Jacynthe."

id="t-525000"&&But another layer of representation was still introduced.
id="t-527000"&&Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
id="t-549000"&&And so I decided to make these pictures, and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.
id="t-555000"&&So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
id="t-555000"&&So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
id="t-555000"&&So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
id="t-561000"&&And Jackson Pollock also. 

id="t-567000"&&Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting, because, you know, you go to that -- you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily, like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.
id="t-578000"&&"Paparazzi."
id="t-582000"&&I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.
id="t-586000"&&And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.
id="t-590000"&&And you render this with the most non-specific material, which is dust itself.
id="t-595000"&&Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.
id="t-599000"&&They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.
id="t-605000"&&This is Richard Serra. 

id="t-613000"&&I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
id="t-613000"&&I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
id="t-613000"&&I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
id="t-621000"&&And I realized that I never worked with color, because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.
id="t-628000"&&But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you can feel more comfortable.
id="t-633000"&&So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.
id="t-638000"&&They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera -- an 8x10 camera.
id="t-644000"&&So you can see the surface of every single swatch -- like in this picture of Chuck Close.
id="t-648000"&&And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
id="t-653000"&&Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today, which is the bit map.
id="t-666000"&&I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."

id="t-672000"&&This is something I used to do as a joke -- you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" -- and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.
id="t-682000"&&I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.
id="t-686000"&&But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original.
id="t-692000"&&And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.
id="t-698000"&&I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking. 

id="t-703000"&&And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions, being 150 meters away.
id="t-709000"&&Now I would do very small ones, which would be like -- but under the same light, and I would show them together, so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.
id="t-719000"&&I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.
id="t-722000"&&I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
id="t-731000"&&This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.
id="t-736000"&&This is a pipe.
id="t-741000"&&A hanger. 

id="t-743000"&&And this is another thing that I did -- you know working -- everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in -- a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.
id="t-757000"&&And I love this work, because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
id="t-765000"&&And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater, that's justified on this thing.
id="t-771000"&&In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place, trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.
id="t-777000"&&And in this, you'd have like a -- something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.
id="t-783000"&&So they're like perfect actors. 

id="t-786000"&&My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.
id="t-792000"&&Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear," and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear, he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
id="t-806000"&&On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think -- and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.
id="t-821000"&&And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so -- plumber, general, plumber, general -- so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one. 

id="t-844000"&&See, I think it's not really about impression, making people fall for a really perfect illusion, as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.
id="t-857000"&&Because it's not about fooling somebody, it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief: how much you want to be fooled.
id="t-865000"&&That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.
id="t-869000"&&Well, I think that's it.
id="t-871000"&&My time is nearly up.
id="t-872000"&&Thank you very much.
