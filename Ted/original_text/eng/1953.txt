id="t-0"&&Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.
id="t-3000"&&As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.
id="t-9000"&&But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.
id="t-13000"&&I wanted to visualize the story of life.
id="t-18000"&&It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.
id="t-25000"&&But there were also revelations.
id="t-27000"&&And one of those I'd like to share with you today. 

id="t-32000"&&I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue.
id="t-46000"&&There's stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it's the only place they still occur today.
id="t-58000"&&Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.
id="t-69000"&&The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today. 

id="t-78000"&&Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.
id="t-82000"&&I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.
id="t-87000"&&It's a story about you and me, nature and science.
id="t-92000"&&And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time.
id="t-120000"&&Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ... solidifying into surface, molded by fire.
id="t-141000"&&The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.
id="t-152000"&&The moon was closer; things were different.
id="t-157000"&&Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.
id="t-170000"&&Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.
id="t-184000"&&Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.
id="t-191000"&&And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars. 

id="t-203000"&&But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.
id="t-210000"&&And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.
id="t-216000"&&It arises around cracks in the Earth.
id="t-220000"&&Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.
id="t-228000"&&Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...
id="t-238000"&&Growing living structures under an alien sky ... Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.
id="t-255000"&&And they changed the atmosphere.
id="t-258000"&&A breath that's fossilized now as iron. 

id="t-266000"&&Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
id="t-272000"&&Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.
id="t-284000"&&These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... circuit boards of the future.
id="t-302000"&&Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms.
id="t-315000"&&It grew as light and oxygen increased.
id="t-323000"&&Life hardened and became defensive.
id="t-323000"&&Life hardened and became defensive.
id="t-323000"&&Life hardened and became defensive.
id="t-345000"&&Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea.
id="t-354000"&&They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone. 

Scorpions follow prey out of the sea.

id="t-395000"&&True land plants arose, leafless at first.
id="t-401000"&&Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.
id="t-407000"&&The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.
id="t-419000"&&Life flourished in swamps. 

On land, life turned a corner.
On land, life turned a corner.
id="t-431000"&&Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.
id="t-440000"&&It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time.
id="t-448000"&&Life turned hard so it could venture inland.
id="t-456000"&&And the dragons that arose are still among us today.
id="t-475000"&&Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.
id="t-495000"&&Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.
id="t-504000"&&One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
id="t-510000"&&And others fly today like echoes of the past.
id="t-516000"&&In birds, life gained new mobility.
id="t-516000"&&In birds, life gained new mobility.
id="t-516000"&&In birds, life gained new mobility.

id="t-539000"&&Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.
id="t-544000"&&Water lilies were among the first.
id="t-553000"&&Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.
id="t-564000"&&In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.
id="t-582000"&&In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.
id="t-588000"&&But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.
id="t-594000"&&Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
id="t-594000"&&Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
id="t-594000"&&Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
id="t-625000"&&Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.
id="t-636000"&&When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.
id="t-640000"&&Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. 

id="t-649000"&&Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.
id="t-657000"&&An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.
id="t-663000"&&But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
id="t-672000"&&When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
id="t-672000"&&When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
id="t-672000"&&When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
id="t-672000"&&When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
id="t-672000"&&When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
id="t-700000"&&New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still. 

id="t-712000"&&Grasslands created opportunities.
id="t-718000"&&Herd safety came with sharpened senses.
id="t-723000"&&Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.
id="t-736000"&&Some mammals turned back to water.
id="t-736000"&&Some mammals turned back to water.
id="t-736000"&&Some mammals turned back to water.
id="t-750000"&&And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
id="t-750000"&&And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
id="t-750000"&&And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
id="t-782000"&&Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later.

So who are we?
So who are we?
So who are we?
id="t-829000"&&We're molded by the same life force.
id="t-836000"&&The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
id="t-846000"&&And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh. 

Life is a force in its own right.

id="t-874000"&&And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.
id="t-884000"&&But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
id="t-889000"&&And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.
id="t-906000"&&The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath, and vice versa.
id="t-922000"&&This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
id="t-922000"&&This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
id="t-922000"&&This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
id="t-937000"&&And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.
id="t-945000"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-945000"&&(Applause) Thank you.
