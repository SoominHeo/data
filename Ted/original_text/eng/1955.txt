id="t-0"&&I work with a species called "Bonobo."
id="t-3000"&&And I'm happy most of the time, because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
id="t-8000"&&It's kind of a well-kept secret.
id="t-11000"&&This species lives only in the Congo.
id="t-13000"&&And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
id="t-19000"&&Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with. 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-24000"&&But -- 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-26000"&&actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
id="t-35000"&&And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.
id="t-42000"&&It permeates their entire life.
id="t-44000"&&And it's used for communication.
id="t-47000"&&And it's used for conflict resolution.
id="t-49000"&&And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts.
id="t-56000"&&We divided our world up with lots of categories.
id="t-60000"&&And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
id="t-63000"&&But I don't think that we were that way initially. 

id="t-67000"&&There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very, very special about man.
id="t-75000"&&Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
id="t-79000"&&Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language.
id="t-79000"&&Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
id="t-79000"&&Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
id="t-79000"&&Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
id="t-102000"&&They had no stone tools.
id="t-105000"&&To our knowledge they had no music.
id="t-109000"&&So when you compare them to the Bonobo, the Bonobo is a little hairier.
id="t-116000"&&He doesn't stand quite as upright.
id="t-121000"&&But there are a lot of similarities.
id="t-124000"&&And I think that as we look at culture, we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are.
id="t-133000"&&And I don't really think it's in our biology; I think we've attributed it to our biology, but I don't really think it's there. 

id="t-141000"&&So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo.
id="t-147000"&&This is Kanzi.
id="t-149000"&&He's a Bonobo.
id="t-151000"&&Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
id="t-154000"&&His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
id="t-158000"&&And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age. 

id="t-165000"&&Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left.
id="t-169000"&&Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
id="t-173000"&&The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are.
id="t-181000"&&This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
id="t-186000"&&As you can see, there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
id="t-195000"&&As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
id="t-206000"&&So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
id="t-208000"&&And now we see all four. 

id="t-211000"&&Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle encircled by the Congo River.
id="t-220000"&&Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area.
id="t-228000"&&It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo, almost three decades ago.
id="t-241000"&&Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
id="t-245000"&&Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
id="t-251000"&&Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
id="t-258000"&&One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
id="t-270000"&&What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
id="t-282000"&&Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. 

id="t-286000"&&SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
id="t-288000"&&None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
id="t-292000"&&None of them are tricks.
id="t-294000"&&They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously, by NHK of Japan.
id="t-300000"&&We have eight Bonobos. 

id="t-302000"&&Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. 

id="t-305000"&&SS: An entire family at our research centre. 

id="t-313000"&&Video: You going to help get some sticks?
id="t-317000"&&Good.
id="t-322000"&&We need more sticks, too.
id="t-331000"&&I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
id="t-334000"&&That's a wasps' nest.
id="t-336000"&&You can get it out.
id="t-340000"&&I hope I have a lighter.
id="t-343000"&&You can use the lighter to start the fire. 

id="t-347000"&&SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
id="t-349000"&&He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter.
id="t-360000"&&He's learning about how to keep a fire going.
id="t-363000"&&He's learning the uses for a fire, just by watching what we do with fire. 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-378000"&&This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
id="t-380000"&&These are happy vocalizations. 

id="t-382000"&&Video: You're happy.
id="t-384000"&&You're very happy about this part.
id="t-384000"&&You're very happy about this part.
id="t-384000"&&You're very happy about this part.
id="t-395000"&&Good job. 

id="t-398000"&&SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
id="t-402000"&&But he likes to carry things from place to place. 

id="t-405000"&&Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."

id="t-407000"&&SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear.
id="t-413000"&&This is his sister.
id="t-415000"&&This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. 

id="t-420000"&&Video: Goodbye. 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-424000"&&SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
id="t-432000"&&She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it. 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-440000"&&Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. 

id="t-445000"&&(Music) 

id="t-449000"&&Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development across two decades, scientists are exploring how cultural forces 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-462000"&&may have operated during human evolution. 

id="t-467000"&&His name is Nyota.
id="t-469000"&&It means "star" in Swahili. 

id="t-445000"&&(Music) 

id="t-481000"&&Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
id="t-487000"&&In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
id="t-492000"&&Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands, to groom Nyota.
id="t-500000"&&Very impressive.
id="t-506000"&&Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this.
id="t-521000"&&Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
id="t-528000"&&Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Panbanisha, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back. 

id="t-552000"&&He can now cut through tough animal hide. 

id="t-556000"&&SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. 

id="t-558000"&&Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
id="t-568000"&&He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flakes.
id="t-577000"&&Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
id="t-585000"&&The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
id="t-589000"&&The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill.
id="t-598000"&&Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago.
id="t-609000"&&These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made.
id="t-614000"&&The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
id="t-619000"&&Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. 

id="t-635000"&&Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.
id="t-638000"&&She keeps staring out the window. 

id="t-643000"&&SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do. 

id="t-646000"&&Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside. 

id="t-652000"&&SS: I normally talk about language. 

id="t-654000"&&Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. 

id="t-657000"&&SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do, I haven't told you that these apes have language.
id="t-662000"&&It's a geometric language. 

id="t-664000"&&Video: She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor.
id="t-667000"&&What is she writing? 

id="t-675000"&&SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice. 

id="t-679000"&&Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. 

id="t-682000"&&SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard. 

id="t-445000"&&(Music) 

id="t-686000"&&They speak when she touches them. 

id="t-688000"&&Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.
id="t-691000"&&"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
id="t-695000"&&Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
id="t-709000"&&Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
id="t-709000"&&Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
id="t-709000"&&Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.

id="t-719000"&&SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. 

id="t-725000"&&Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
id="t-727000"&&The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
id="t-734000"&&The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
id="t-738000"&&It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. 

id="t-742000"&&SS: That's an institutional requirement. 

id="t-745000"&&Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines.
id="t-755000"&&Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
id="t-763000"&&Panbanisha watched.
id="t-765000"&&Soon she began to write as well.
id="t-769000"&&The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
id="t-773000"&&How did they develop? 

id="t-775000"&&SS (video): We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
id="t-782000"&&It's simply to use language around them, because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
id="t-793000"&&Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely.
id="t-802000"&&So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos, like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun, and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them.
id="t-819000"&&Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. 

id="t-832000"&&Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
id="t-840000"&&Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
id="t-844000"&&Is he looking for where the sound came from?
id="t-847000"&&Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
id="t-862000"&&This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
id="t-865000"&&She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 

Researcher: Go ahead.
Researcher: Go ahead.
Researcher: Go ahead.
Researcher: Go ahead.
Researcher: Go ahead.

id="t-911000"&&Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
id="t-919000"&&Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. 

id="t-23000"&&(Laughter) 

Researcher: OK, now get the monsters.
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters.
id="t-944000"&&Take the cherries too.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-947000"&&Now watch out, stay away from them now.
id="t-970000"&&Oh no!
id="t-970000"&&Oh no!
id="t-970000"&&Oh no!
id="t-970000"&&Oh no!

id="t-979000"&&Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine? 

id="t-992000"&&SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."
id="t-999000"&&We're learning how to become like them.
id="t-1001000"&&We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones.
id="t-1005000"&&We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
id="t-1009000"&&And they're learning to become like us.
id="t-1011000"&&Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
id="t-1014000"&&So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species. 

id="t-1020000"&&Thank you.
