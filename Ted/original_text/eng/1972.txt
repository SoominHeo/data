id="t-1000"&&I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television, "I'm really getting into the Internet lately.
id="t-10000"&&I just wish it were more organized."
id="t-12000"&&So ... (Laughter) If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay.
id="t-24000"&&Take the money; go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language. 

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-34000"&&If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.
id="t-39000"&&Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.
id="t-48000"&&You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
id="t-51000"&&Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions.
id="t-56000"&&If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website.
id="t-64000"&&That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. 

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-71000"&&Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people. 

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-77000"&&They would not email you back (Laughter) -- but you'd get an automated reply. 

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.
id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.
id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) Their name in your inbox (Laughter) -- it's all you wanted anyway.

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-93000"&&Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.
id="t-96000"&&Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."
id="t-100000"&&If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
id="t-100000"&&If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
id="t-100000"&&If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
id="t-116000"&&Now follow me, OK? 

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-118000"&&Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.
id="t-121000"&&One, two, three.
id="t-123000"&&That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
id="t-125000"&&That is my grandfather.
id="t-127000"&&They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
id="t-129000"&&He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom, who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far.
id="t-141000"&&So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?
id="t-147000"&&But at that point, I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis (Laughter) -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.
id="t-158000"&&I wouldn't need it.
id="t-160000"&&I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop!
id="t-160000"&&I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop!

id="t-13000"&&(Laughter) 

Huh?
Huh?
id="t-172000"&&I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
id="t-191000"&&I guess it's just like life.
id="t-193000"&&It is not a question of if you can -- it's: do ya?
id="t-197000"&&We can interfere with the interface.
id="t-199000"&&We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on.
id="t-204000"&&You don't say a prayer.
id="t-206000"&&You don't write a psalm.
id="t-208000"&&You don't chant an "om."
id="t-210000"&&You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
id="t-220000"&&Thank you, TED. 

id="t-221000"&&(Applause)
