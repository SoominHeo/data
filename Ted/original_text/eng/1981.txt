id="t-0"&&I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
id="t-5000"&&We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.
id="t-5000"&&We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.
id="t-14000"&&We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done.
id="t-25000"&&And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
id="t-40000"&&And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.
id="t-53000"&&They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
id="t-61000"&&We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. 

id="t-68000"&&I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.
id="t-80000"&&We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. 

id="t-85000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-86000"&&What we're looking forward to is -- 

id="t-89000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-90000"&&what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
id="t-111000"&&We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
id="t-117000"&&And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
id="t-117000"&&And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
id="t-117000"&&And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
id="t-137000"&&That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
id="t-141000"&&And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
id="t-149000"&&What they look at is the most important thing. 

id="t-153000"&&Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
id="t-156000"&&And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.
id="t-162000"&&It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that."
id="t-162000"&&It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that."
id="t-162000"&&It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that."
id="t-162000"&&It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that."
id="t-179000"&&Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
id="t-187000"&&There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
id="t-196000"&&The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.
id="t-204000"&&So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today.
id="t-204000"&&So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today.
id="t-219000"&&That has not happened at all in space flying.
id="t-221000"&&There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. 

id="t-225000"&&Well, who was inspired during that time period?
id="t-227000"&&Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
id="t-233000"&&And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
id="t-244000"&&Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
id="t-244000"&&Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
id="t-244000"&&Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
id="t-255000"&&And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now.
id="t-255000"&&And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now.
id="t-265000"&&But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. 

id="t-85000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-275000"&&If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport.
id="t-288000"&&You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
id="t-299000"&&Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
id="t-301000"&&I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days.
id="t-301000"&&I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days.
id="t-309000"&&I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
id="t-314000"&&And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
id="t-314000"&&And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
id="t-314000"&&And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
id="t-314000"&&And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
id="t-328000"&&And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
id="t-335000"&&And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. 

id="t-339000"&&The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
id="t-347000"&&Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
id="t-347000"&&Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
id="t-347000"&&Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
id="t-358000"&&The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander.

id="t-358000"&&The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander.

id="t-373000"&&This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

id="t-373000"&&This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

id="t-383000"&&Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
id="t-392000"&&These things tend to happen every 25 years.
id="t-392000"&&These things tend to happen every 25 years.

id="t-392000"&&These things tend to happen every 25 years.
id="t-411000"&&These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.
id="t-419000"&&Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it.
id="t-425000"&&You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
id="t-429000"&&Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
id="t-432000"&&But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.
id="t-432000"&&But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.

id="t-432000"&&But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.

id="t-445000"&&The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year.
id="t-455000"&&In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
id="t-464000"&&There were only three or four flights in 2003.
id="t-466000"&&In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.

id="t-491000"&&This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
id="t-494000"&&This is a picture here taken from orbit.
id="t-496000"&&Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
id="t-502000"&&We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.
id="t-510000"&&And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. 

id="t-522000"&&Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?
id="t-525000"&&The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
id="t-529000"&&There's another one announced just last week.
id="t-529000"&&There's another one announced just last week.
id="t-529000"&&There's another one announced just last week.
id="t-529000"&&There's another one announced just last week.
id="t-552000"&&That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
id="t-557000"&&It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
id="t-563000"&&I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
id="t-568000"&&But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
id="t-576000"&&And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view.
id="t-576000"&&And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view.
id="t-583000"&&Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
id="t-588000"&&Oh, it's going to be so much fun. 

id="t-85000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-592000"&&OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
id="t-592000"&&OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
id="t-592000"&&OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
id="t-606000"&&And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.
id="t-606000"&&And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.
id="t-606000"&&And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.

id="t-606000"&&And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.

id="t-85000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-626000"&&Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games.
id="t-632000"&&For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.
id="t-636000"&&But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.
id="t-649000"&&And the inventor is in this audience.
id="t-651000"&&Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list.
id="t-85000"&&(Laughter) And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes.
id="t-680000"&&So fun is defendable. 

id="t-683000"&&OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
id="t-691000"&&And in it also brings up another point, right here.
id="t-695000"&&There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period.
id="t-714000"&&Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
id="t-733000"&&These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore.
id="t-733000"&&These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore.

They were inspired by big progress.
They were inspired by big progress.
id="t-766000"&&There were a couple of examples here.
id="t-768000"&&The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71.
id="t-768000"&&The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71.
id="t-768000"&&The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71.
id="t-782000"&&It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service.
id="t-782000"&&It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service.

id="t-795000"&&But something is out there to inspire our kids now.
id="t-799000"&&And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now.
id="t-802000"&&What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
id="t-808000"&&Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane.
id="t-808000"&&Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane.
id="t-819000"&&The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better?
id="t-828000"&&But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
id="t-842000"&&But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
id="t-846000"&&OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it. 

id="t-852000"&&You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
id="t-852000"&&You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
id="t-852000"&&You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
id="t-870000"&&Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
id="t-874000"&&America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing.
id="t-883000"&&And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.
id="t-883000"&&And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.
id="t-883000"&&And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.
id="t-883000"&&And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.
id="t-883000"&&And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.

id="t-902000"&&Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.
id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.
id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.
id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.

id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.
id="t-908000"&&You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it.
id="t-940000"&&100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
id="t-943000"&&But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
id="t-958000"&&And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?
id="t-958000"&&And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?
id="t-958000"&&And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?
id="t-973000"&&But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. 

id="t-977000"&&I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.
id="t-977000"&&I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.
id="t-989000"&&The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
id="t-995000"&&And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
id="t-999000"&&I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. 

id="t-1006000"&&OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
id="t-1010000"&&This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.
id="t-1010000"&&This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.
id="t-1010000"&&This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.
id="t-1010000"&&This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.
id="t-1045000"&&I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
id="t-1062000"&&I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
id="t-1073000"&&And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.
id="t-1073000"&&And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.
id="t-1073000"&&And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.
id="t-1073000"&&And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.
id="t-1112000"&&You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time.
id="t-1112000"&&You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time.
id="t-1125000"&&But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it.
id="t-1125000"&&But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it.

id="t-1150000"&&OK, thank you very much.
