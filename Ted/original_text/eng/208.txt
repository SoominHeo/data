id="t-8056"&&You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see.
id="t-14326"&&That's largely true.
id="t-15998"&&Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. 

id="t-20363"&&But there is also a lot that I can do.
id="t-23730"&&This is me rock climbing for the first time.
id="t-27166"&&Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on.
id="t-37382"&&But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me.
id="t-42514"&&I want to be independent. 

id="t-45741"&&I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident.
id="t-50989"&&I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind.
id="t-56840"&&The hardest thing for me was losing my independence.
id="t-61600"&&Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone.
id="t-67962"&&For example, one of my challenges was textbooks.
id="t-72084"&&Back then, there were no personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones.
id="t-77319"&&So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks, and I had to create my own books in Braille.
id="t-86653"&&Can you imagine?
id="t-88603"&&Of course, my brothers were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them.
id="t-95593"&&(Laughter) I think they tried to stay away from me.
id="t-100434"&&I don't blame them.
id="t-102581"&&I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone.
id="t-107160"&&That became my strong desire to ignite innovation. 

id="t-112100"&&Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.
id="t-114810"&&I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille?
id="t-126288"&&These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself.
id="t-133805"&&That's the moment my innovation journey began. 

id="t-138686"&&I started developing digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network.
id="t-151178"&&Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice.
id="t-161998"&&This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015.
id="t-169242"&&But Braille went digital many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago.
id="t-181242"&&Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then.
id="t-191343"&&And this is actually not the first time this happened, because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation.
id="t-203467"&&The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people.
id="t-209737"&&Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities. 

id="t-216807"&&Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life.
id="t-220688"&&In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing.
id="t-226895"&&I remember the first time I went on the web.
id="t-230148"&&I was astonished.
id="t-232352"&&I could access newspapers at any time and every day.
id="t-236810"&&I could even search for any information by myself.
id="t-241175"&&I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified the user interface. 

id="t-256685"&&This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages.
id="t-267784"&&When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users.
id="t-273909"&&One that I strongly remember said, "For me, the Internet is a small window to the world."

id="t-283185"&&It was a revolutionary moment for the blind.
id="t-287130"&&The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined.
id="t-296539"&&It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking. 

id="t-306116"&&Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough.
id="t-311668"&&For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance.
id="t-318412"&&My goal is to come up here independently.
id="t-322147"&&And not just here.
id="t-323991"&&My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you. 

id="t-330638"&&OK, now let me show you the latest technologies.
id="t-333471"&&This is a smartphone app that we are working on. 

id="t-338625"&&(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight. 

EV: Take the two doors to go out.
EV: Take the two doors to go out.

EV: Nick is approaching.
EV: Nick is approaching.
id="t-357693"&&Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick! 

id="t-95593"&&(Laughter) CA: Where are you going?
id="t-95593"&&(Laughter) CA: Where are you going?

id="t-362114"&&Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted.
id="t-362114"&&Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted.
id="t-362114"&&Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted.

Nick: Thanks.
Nick: Thanks.
id="t-369597"&&(Chieko and Nick laugh) 

id="t-370971"&&Man: Hi.
id="t-95593"&&(Laughter) CA: Oh ... hi. 

id="t-375070"&&EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone. 

id="t-384434"&&EV: Potato chips. 

id="t-393159"&&EV: Dark chocolate with almonds. 

id="t-396155"&&EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate. 

id="t-95593"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-402456"&&EV: Approaching. 

id="t-408038"&&EV: You arrived. 

id="t-410939"&&CA: Now ... 

id="t-412202"&&(Applause) 

id="t-416154"&&Thank you. 

id="t-417369"&&So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself.
id="t-431103"&&But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching, in which mood -- we are still working on that part.
id="t-440251"&&And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social. 

id="t-447398"&&So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world.
id="t-455920"&&We call this cognitive assistance.
id="t-459821"&&It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers.
id="t-470088"&&Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities -- in other words, our five senses.
id="t-479464"&&This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street.
id="t-494088"&&It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me.
id="t-499595"&&It will become my best buddy, and yours. 

id="t-504308"&&So, this really is a great challenge.
id="t-508395"&&It is a challenge that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities.
id="t-519192"&&Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. 

id="t-526487"&&The frontier is the real world.
id="t-529878"&&The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder.
id="t-536559"&&I hope to work with you to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself. 

id="t-549539"&&Thank you so much. 

id="t-412202"&&(Applause)
