id="t-960"&&Imagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain," "thank you," or "I love you."
id="t-8840"&&Being trapped inside your body, a body that doesn't respond to commands.
id="t-14120"&&Surrounded by people, yet utterly alone.
id="t-17440"&&Wishing you could reach out, to connect, to comfort, to participate.
id="t-23400"&&For 13 long years, that was my reality. 

id="t-27520"&&Most of us never think twice about talking, about communicating.
id="t-33080"&&I've thought a lot about it.
id="t-35240"&&I've had a lot of time to think. 

id="t-37920"&&For the first 12 years of my life, I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.
id="t-42760"&&Then everything changed.
id="t-44920"&&I contracted a brain infection.
id="t-47200"&&The doctors weren't sure what it was, but they treated me the best they could.
id="t-52040"&&However, I progressively got worse.
id="t-55440"&&Eventually, I lost my ability to control my movements, make eye contact, and finally, my ability to speak. 

id="t-65280"&&While in hospital, I desperately wanted to go home.
id="t-69120"&&I said to my mother, "When home?"
id="t-72440"&&Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice.
id="t-76920"&&I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness.
id="t-80760"&&My parents were told I was as good as not there.
id="t-83600"&&A vegetable, having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby.
id="t-88240"&&They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until I died. 

id="t-94000"&&My parents, in fact my entire family's lives, became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how.
id="t-101880"&&Their friends drifted away.
id="t-104240"&&One year turned to two, two turned to three.
id="t-108240"&&It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear.
id="t-112680"&&The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away.
id="t-117600"&&I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one.
id="t-122080"&&I had become a ghost, a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved. 

id="t-128199"&&Meanwhile, my mind began knitting itself back together.
id="t-132480"&&Gradually, my awareness started to return.
id="t-135520"&&But no one realized that I had come back to life.
id="t-138880"&&I was aware of everything, just like any normal person.
id="t-142760"&&I could see and understand everything, but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know.
id="t-148560"&&My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body, a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis. 

id="t-156920"&&The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself, totally alone.
id="t-164080"&&I was trapped with only my thoughts for company.
id="t-167720"&&I would never be rescued.
id="t-169920"&&No one would ever show me tenderness.
id="t-172880"&&I would never talk to a friend.
id="t-175160"&&No one would ever love me.
id="t-177920"&&I had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to.
id="t-182080"&&Well, nothing pleasant.
id="t-184600"&&I lived in fear, and, to put it bluntly, was waiting for death to finally release me, expecting to die all alone in a care home. 

id="t-194520"&&I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words what it's like not to be able to communicate.
id="t-200760"&&Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted, stifled and muted within you.
id="t-210000"&&For me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness.
id="t-214520"&&I simply existed.
id="t-216680"&&It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense, you have vanished.
id="t-223000"&&Other people controlled every aspect of my life.
id="t-226240"&&They decided what I ate and when.
id="t-228560"&&Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair.
id="t-232560"&&I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV watching Barney reruns.
id="t-238440"&&I think because Barney is so happy and jolly, and I absolutely wasn't, it made it so much worse. 

id="t-245800"&&I was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people's perceptions of me.
id="t-251720"&&I was a silent, invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching.
id="t-257720"&&Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.
id="t-261440"&&With no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim: a defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires.
id="t-273200"&&For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care abused me physically, verbally and sexually.
id="t-280760"&&Despite what they thought, I did feel.
id="t-284400"&&The first time it happened, I was shocked and filled with disbelief.
id="t-288840"&&How could they do this to me?
id="t-291120"&&I was confused.
id="t-292720"&&What had I done to deserve this?
id="t-295440"&&Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight.
id="t-299520"&&Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me.
id="t-303280"&&I felt worthless.
id="t-305080"&&There was no one to comfort me.
id="t-308080"&&But neither of my parents knew this was happening.
id="t-311360"&&I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again.
id="t-315440"&&I just never knew when.
id="t-317560"&&All I knew was that I would never be the same.
id="t-321360"&&I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing, "No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity."
id="t-329880"&&And I thought to myself, "You want to bet?"

id="t-335120"&&Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped.
id="t-338880"&&But the years of constant caretaking, having to wake up every two hours to turn me, combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son, had taken a toll on my mother and father.
id="t-350840"&&Following yet another heated argument between my parents, in a moment of despair and desperation, my mother turned to me and told me that I should die.
id="t-362160"&&I was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said, I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother, yet I could do nothing about it. 

id="t-372640"&&There were many moments when I gave up, sinking into a dark abyss.
id="t-377440"&&I remember one particularly low moment.
id="t-380600"&&My dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store.
id="t-386480"&&A random stranger walked past, looked at me and he smiled.
id="t-392880"&&I may never know why, but that simple act, the fleeting moment of human connection, transformed how I was feeling, making me want to keep going. 

id="t-403760"&&My existence was tortured by monotony, a reality that was often too much to bear.
id="t-409760"&&Alone with my thoughts, I constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor.
id="t-417320"&&I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were.
id="t-422440"&&As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed, I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home.
id="t-431280"&&Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day. 

id="t-437600"&&My mind became a tool that I could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies.
id="t-447800"&&I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life.
id="t-452680"&&But I had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves, and in my place was the person people expected me to be.
id="t-461760"&&To some I was Martin, a vacant shell, the vegetable, deserving of harsh words, dismissal and even abuse.
id="t-470000"&&To others, I was the tragically brain-damaged boy who had grown to become a man.
id="t-475200"&&Someone they were kind to and cared for.
id="t-478400"&&Good or bad, I was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected. 

id="t-485160"&&It took someone new to see me in a different way.
id="t-488480"&&An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week.
id="t-492760"&&Whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice, she became convinced that I could understand what was being said.
id="t-501960"&&She urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication.
id="t-508800"&&And within a year, I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate.
id="t-514120"&&It was exhilarating, but frustrating at times.
id="t-517880"&&I had so many words in my mind, that I couldn't wait to be able to share them.
id="t-522720"&&Sometimes, I would say things to myself simply because I could.
id="t-527480"&&In myself, I had a ready audience, and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes, others would listen, too. 

id="t-535040"&&But as I began to communicate more, I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself.
id="t-543480"&&I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in.
id="t-547840"&&I stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies.
id="t-553400"&&As simple as this may sound, it was amazing.
id="t-556880"&&My new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening.
id="t-561760"&&I was like a man-child, and as liberating as it often was, I struggled.
id="t-567480"&&I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads.
id="t-575720"&&While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair.
id="t-582000"&&I realized that some people would only listen to me if what I said was in line with what they expected.
id="t-587800"&&Otherwise, it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best. 

id="t-592520"&&I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message.
id="t-598400"&&It is about getting the message heard and respected.
id="t-602960"&&Still, things were going well.
id="t-605240"&&My body was slowly getting stronger.
id="t-607840"&&I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years. 

id="t-615240"&&However, I longed to share my life with someone.
id="t-619200"&&I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work, thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to.
id="t-628360"&&Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life, I met Joan.
id="t-634640"&&Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me, but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself.
id="t-643040"&&Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me.
id="t-647680"&&However, after all I had been through, I still couldn't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who I am. 

id="t-658080"&&I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man.
id="t-662280"&&The first time someone referred to me as a man, it stopped me in my tracks.
id="t-667440"&&I felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?"
id="t-672080"&&That all changed with Joan.
id="t-674280"&&We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly.
id="t-680560"&&I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought.
id="t-685520"&&I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love. 

id="t-689840"&&I began to reshape my destiny.
id="t-692320"&&I spoke up a little more at work.
id="t-694560"&&I asserted my need for independence to the people around me.
id="t-698960"&&Being given a means of communication changed everything.
id="t-702840"&&I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those I had of myself. 

id="t-710680"&&Communication is what makes us human, enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us -- telling our own stories, expressing wants, needs and desires, or hearing those of others by really listening.
id="t-726080"&&All this is how the world knows who we are.
id="t-729440"&&So who are we without it? 

id="t-732480"&&True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world.
id="t-739800"&&Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair.
id="t-746240"&&Today, I am so much more.
id="t-748520"&&A husband, a son, a friend, a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate, a keen amateur photographer.
id="t-757600"&&It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this. 

id="t-762320"&&We are told that actions speak louder than words.
id="t-766040"&&But I wonder, do they?
id="t-770880"&&Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful.
id="t-775680"&&Whether we speak the words with our own voices, type them with our eyes, or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us, words are among our most powerful tools. 

id="t-788400"&&I have come to you through a terrible darkness, pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself.
id="t-795720"&&The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light.
id="t-799760"&&We are shining here together.
id="t-802080"&&If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating, it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude.
id="t-812680"&&It all sounds the same.
id="t-814960"&&But if you will, please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can: 

id="t-822480"&&Thank you. 

id="t-824280"&&(Applause)
