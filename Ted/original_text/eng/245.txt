id="t-999"&&Last year, I went on my first book tour.
id="t-4271"&&In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks.
id="t-10462"&&Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began, alas, with a lie: "Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria," or "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States."
id="t-28428"&&Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it -- England, America, Ghana, Nigeria -- I thought, "But that's not true."
id="t-39127"&&Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.
id="t-43436"&&My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana.
id="t-48815"&&My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
id="t-58804"&&For this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational."
id="t-64498"&&"But Nike is multinational," I thought, "I'm a human being."

id="t-71124"&&Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann.
id="t-81580"&&We were discussing the role of locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me.
id="t-87157"&&I'm not multinational.
id="t-89166"&&I'm not a national at all.
id="t-92186"&&How could I come from a nation?
id="t-94999"&&How can a human being come from a concept?
id="t-98745"&&It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.
id="t-103403"&&From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it?
id="t-126191"&&In my lifetime, countries had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste; failed -- Somalia.
id="t-135224"&&My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.
id="t-139522"&&To me, a country -- this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being. 

id="t-149602"&&And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.
id="t-155232"&&What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.
id="t-164295"&&When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief.
id="t-171598"&&It was as I had suspected.
id="t-174352"&&History was real, cultures were real, but countries were invented.
id="t-181022"&&For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state. 

id="t-190198"&&In 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan," sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.
id="t-200053"&&It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience, and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.
id="t-210224"&&"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked, "when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"

id="t-220777"&&Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant.
id="t-224999"&&I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana.
id="t-228472"&&Her parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent.
id="t-233506"&&Layla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana."
id="t-243648"&&In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra.
id="t-252376"&&I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports.
id="t-263219"&&I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets -- the privileging of a fiction, the singular country, over reality: human experience.
id="t-276363"&&Speaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.
id="t-281433"&&"All experience is local," he said.
id="t-284788"&&"All identity is experience," I thought.
id="t-288836"&&"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.
id="t-288836"&&"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.
id="t-288836"&&"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.

id="t-295876"&&See, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth.
id="t-300452"&&I have no relationship with the United States, all 50 of them, not really.
id="t-305831"&&My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.
id="t-315797"&&What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur.
id="t-326076"&&Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.
id="t-336738"&&My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours.
id="t-347209"&&These are the places that shape my experience.
id="t-350607"&&My experience is where I'm from. 

What if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?"
What if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?"
id="t-359610"&&This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.
id="t-364047"&&Tell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés?
id="t-368655"&&Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France?
id="t-373355"&&Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.
id="t-381002"&&Our experience is where we're from. 

id="t-383999"&&So, where are you a local?
id="t-386070"&&I propose a three-step test.
id="t-388601"&&I call these the three "R’s": rituals, relationships, restrictions. 

id="t-394619"&&First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops, saying your prayers.
id="t-403514"&&What kind of rituals are these?
id="t-405760"&&Where do they occur?
id="t-407237"&&In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?
id="t-412582"&&As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.
id="t-421654"&&We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly polite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.
id="t-428865"&&In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South.
id="t-434132"&&The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt.
id="t-440359"&&The rituals were familiar.
id="t-442975"&&"R" number one, rituals. 

id="t-445578"&&Now, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days.
id="t-450065"&&To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime?
id="t-455453"&&Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking about your Facebook friends.
id="t-460064"&&I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.
id="t-464371"&&My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me.
id="t-471822"&&"R" number two, relationships. 

id="t-474665"&&We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions.
id="t-485075"&&By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?
id="t-487942"&&What passport do you hold?
id="t-489999"&&Are you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live?
id="t-495290"&&By civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation, from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child?
id="t-504396"&&This is the least sexy of the R’s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past "Where are you now?"
id="t-513333"&&to "Why aren't you there, and why?"
id="t-517174"&&Rituals, relationships, restrictions. 

id="t-520503"&&Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns, then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.
id="t-529041"&&A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge. 

id="t-537848"&&So let's try it.
id="t-539088"&&I have a friend named Olu.
id="t-540877"&&He's 35 years old.
id="t-542496"&&His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.
id="t-546465"&&Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10.
id="t-550050"&&When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London, then came to Berlin.
id="t-554316"&&He loves going to Nigeria -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the political corruption there.
id="t-562655"&&Where is Olu from? 

id="t-564426"&&I have another friend named Udo.
id="t-566641"&&He's also 35 years old.
id="t-568624"&&Udo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland, after the war.
id="t-576511"&&Udo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin.
id="t-580417"&&He loves going to Argentina -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the economic corruption there.
id="t-587467"&&Where is Udo from?
id="t-589429"&&With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin.
id="t-597166"&&That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history.
id="t-601499"&&That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life. 

id="t-606774"&&Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.
id="t-610999"&&He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one.
id="t-615517"&&To claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends. 

id="t-625531"&&Meanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay. 

id="t-635228"&&Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur.
id="t-645634"&&To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience.
id="t-651896"&&Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same. 

id="t-656146"&&Of course, when we ask, "Where are you from?"
id="t-658584"&&we're using a kind of shorthand.
id="t-660529"&&It's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin," and as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood.
id="t-671255"&&But that's not quite the point.
id="t-674310"&&The difference between "Where are you from?"
id="t-676923"&&and "Where are you a local?"
id="t-678463"&&isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question.
id="t-684040"&&Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs.
id="t-693349"&&Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players.
id="t-703659"&&As a unit of measurement for human experience, the country doesn't quite work.
id="t-708999"&&That's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria."
id="t-713249"&&The "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.
id="t-723164"&&"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed.
id="t-732176"&&You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience.
id="t-736563"&&That I carry within me.
id="t-738698"&&Where I'm from comes wherever I go. 

id="t-742253"&&To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.
id="t-745645"&&There's much to be said for national history, more for the sovereign state.
id="t-749788"&&Culture exists in community, and community exists in context.
id="t-754509"&&Geography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important.
id="t-759006"&&What I'm questioning is primacy.
id="t-761999"&&All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.
id="t-771510"&&What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?
id="t-775439"&&And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer? 

id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.
id="t-778999"&&Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.

id="t-795703"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-797387"&&It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game, especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.
id="t-804437"&&As any recent immigrant knows, the question "Where are you from?"
id="t-804437"&&As any recent immigrant knows, the question "Where are you from?"
id="t-810999"&&is often code for "Why are you here?"

id="t-814324"&&Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges.
id="t-819257"&&"Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan -- never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers."

id="t-830114"&&I'm with him.
id="t-831297"&&To call one student American, another Pakistani, then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.
id="t-841744"&&The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.
id="t-845593"&&A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies. 

id="t-855946"&&Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them.
id="t-861303"&&I'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana.
id="t-864422"&&I go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana.
id="t-868766"&&It's not because I wasn't born there.
id="t-870591"&&My father can't go back, either.
id="t-872948"&&The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists.
id="t-877357"&&We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.
id="t-881216"&&Something, somewhere will always have changed, most of all, ourselves.
id="t-886738"&&People. 

id="t-887985"&&Finally, what we're talking about is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.
id="t-894888"&&In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.
id="t-898310"&&The more we know about where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human the characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less.
id="t-907800"&&The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.
id="t-917254"&&In fact, all of us are multi -- multi-local, multi-layered.
id="t-921583"&&To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think, not further apart.
id="t-928996"&&So the next time that I'm introduced, I'd love to hear the truth: "Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here.
id="t-938226"&&She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.
id="t-942308"&&She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra."

id="t-945411"&&Thank you. 

id="t-946596"&&(Applause)
