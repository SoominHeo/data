id="t-800"&&In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
id="t-6960"&&Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
id="t-12280"&&Her doctor was called Alois.
id="t-15840"&&Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906.
id="t-22520"&&After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before. 

id="t-30880"&&Now here's the even more striking thing.
id="t-34000"&&If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
id="t-44080"&&Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
id="t-48520"&&And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
id="t-55680"&&Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
id="t-59200"&&We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more.
id="t-70896"&&But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. 

id="t-78440"&&I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
id="t-83800"&&So I think about this all the time.
id="t-86280"&&Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
id="t-90360"&&But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people -- which, by the way, will include many of you.
id="t-101040"&&If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
id="t-111600"&&In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's.
id="t-122480"&&Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
id="t-129919"&&One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
id="t-134680"&&It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages. 

id="t-144000"&&It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
id="t-152760"&&But we've done relatively little to address it.
id="t-155960"&&Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
id="t-167800"&&We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it.
id="t-175240"&&The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer. 

id="t-191880"&&The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness.
id="t-198600"&&Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
id="t-208320"&&For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.
id="t-216360"&&We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
id="t-221000"&&But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
id="t-230960"&&As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal. 

id="t-242480"&&Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago.
id="t-248280"&&For almost a century, we didn't know much about these.
id="t-252240"&&Today we know they're made from protein molecules.
id="t-255640"&&You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
id="t-262160"&&There are spots on the paper that are sticky.
id="t-264600"&&And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
id="t-269560"&&But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
id="t-274040"&&This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.
id="t-281680"&&That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. 

id="t-285240"&&We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works.
id="t-291800"&&There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb.
id="t-298600"&&Cutting one wire might do nothing.
id="t-300720"&&Cutting others might make the bomb explore.
id="t-304160"&&We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it. 

id="t-309000"&&Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best.
id="t-313560"&&But now we've got together a diverse group of people -- medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
id="t-322040"&&And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. 

id="t-332360"&&Now let me show you some of our latest results.
id="t-334880"&&No one outside of our lab has seen these yet.
id="t-337560"&&Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms.
id="t-342560"&&So these are healthy worms, and you can see they're moving around normally.
id="t-347560"&&These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's.
id="t-355240"&&And you can see they're clearly sick.
id="t-357560"&&But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan.
id="t-367200"&&This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. 

id="t-375640"&&After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
id="t-384040"&&But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
id="t-388920"&&This isn't about scientists like me -- it's about you.
id="t-392600"&&We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it.
id="t-398840"&&In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators.
id="t-409040"&&That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s.
id="t-413920"&&Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer.
id="t-418320"&&But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.
id="t-422680"&&And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change.
id="t-431320"&&So, it really is down to you.
id="t-435720"&&Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease.
id="t-439080"&&Everyone with a brain is at risk.
id="t-442160"&&Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
id="t-449600"&&Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure. 

id="t-455346"&&Thank you. 

id="t-456520"&&(Applause)
