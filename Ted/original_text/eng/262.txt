id="t-746"&&Today, I want to talk to you about dreams. 

id="t-3999"&&I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life, and it's cooler than in the movies.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear ... (Laughter) I can do things like read and write music.
id="t-21344"&&Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream.
id="t-21344"&&Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream.
id="t-21344"&&Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream.

id="t-29873"&&I am a very visual thinker.
id="t-32393"&&I think in pictures, not words.
id="t-35174"&&To me, words are more like instincts and language. 

id="t-39993"&&There are many people like me; Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything -- all of his inventions -- in his mind, accurately. 

id="t-54633"&&Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway.
id="t-57999"&&I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of Google Translate.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-66741"&&My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me.
id="t-71307"&&For example, once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-80527"&&There are some other unusual things about me.
id="t-84391"&&You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice.
id="t-88479"&&That's why people often confuse me with a GPS.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) Thank you.
id="t-105642"&&(Applause) 

id="t-110600"&&A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the first time.
id="t-117381"&&The photographer told me to look flirty.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) And I had no idea what she was talking about.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-126724"&&She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys."

"What thing?"
"What thing?"

id="t-133608"&&"You know, squint."

id="t-135553"&&And so I tried, really.
id="t-137261"&&It looked something like this.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) I looked like I was searching for Waldo.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-148582"&&There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-160918"&&I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display.
id="t-170726"&&It's made life difficult in many ways, and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially.
id="t-177955"&&My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them.
id="t-182320"&&My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert -- and they taught me humor.
id="t-190881"&&My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm.
id="t-198322"&&Needless to say, I did not have many friends.
id="t-201714"&&I was also hypersensitive to texture.
id="t-204722"&&The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower.
id="t-211251"&&I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-218487"&&I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents -- things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse.
id="t-233270"&&And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within days of them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead.
id="t-246109"&&I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me.
id="t-252769"&&My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide. 

id="t-266180"&&I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma, and my social anxiety, and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed.
id="t-278202"&&And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things. 

id="t-284710"&&One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.
id="t-296872"&&But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the world.
id="t-303416"&&And this can make basic communication a challenge. 

id="t-308106"&&Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner -- (Laughter) (Applause) thank you -- where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... (Laughter) Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her, "What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?"
id="t-358873"&&And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) I said, "Great!
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) I said, "Great!
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me. 

id="t-373838"&&So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the opposite.
id="t-382211"&&It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively.
id="t-386810"&&At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, presenting this research.
id="t-105642"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-105642"&&(Applause) And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees.
id="t-105642"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-105642"&&(Applause) 

id="t-421287"&&But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma.
id="t-430698"&&I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there is: autism-assistive technology.
id="t-438503"&&This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder, or ASD. 

id="t-446465"&&The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills.
id="t-457324"&&In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience.
id="t-468561"&&And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after practicing on it some more.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help.
id="t-487815"&&But it's more than that.
id="t-489466"&&There's more that can be done.
id="t-492274"&&For people with ASD -- it has been speculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists, and engineers have it; like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates are some examples.
id="t-512361"&&But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks.
id="t-521249"&&And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of.
id="t-529175"&&So my dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding. 

id="t-539808"&&One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free, without judgment of social and physical consequences.
id="t-549638"&&When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind, I am at peace.
id="t-555346"&&I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever I want, you know?
id="t-559430"&&I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it.
id="t-8740"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-567759"&&But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that, and more important.
id="t-573725"&&My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do.
id="t-586562"&&I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example.
id="t-590022"&&And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward.
id="t-597532"&&In addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world, in real time. 

id="t-104444"&&Thank you. 

id="t-105642"&&(Applause) 

id="t-104444"&&Thank you. 

id="t-105642"&&(Applause)
