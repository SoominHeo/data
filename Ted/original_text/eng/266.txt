id="t-849"&&For the past decade, I've been studying non-state armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.
id="t-9588"&&I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
id="t-12785"&&My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation.
id="t-21987"&&I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library. 

id="t-25749"&&Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict, because war has changed.
id="t-32464"&&It used to be a contest between states.
id="t-35568"&&No longer.
id="t-36743"&&It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
id="t-41236"&&For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.
id="t-53634"&&So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful. 

id="t-61808"&&So how do we do that?
id="t-63805"&&We need to know what makes these organizations tick.
id="t-67148"&&We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.
id="t-73043"&&Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.
id="t-76659"&&It is all part of the same organization.
id="t-78981"&&We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them, if we don't have the full picture. 

id="t-85140"&&And armed groups today are complex organizations.
id="t-88222"&&Take the Lebanese Hezbollah, known for its violent confrontation against Israel.
id="t-92956"&&But since its creation in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has also set up a political party, a social-service network, and a military apparatus.
id="t-101765"&&Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
id="t-110234"&&So these groups do way more than just shoot.
id="t-113453"&&They multi-task.
id="t-115239"&&They set up complex communication machines -- radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and social media strategies.
id="t-123422"&&And up here, you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit.
id="t-129259"&&Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising -- not looting, but setting up profitable businesses; for example, construction companies.
id="t-138491"&&Now, these activities are keys.
id="t-140398"&&They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand. 

id="t-147537"&&Armed groups also do something else: they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services.
id="t-154457"&&They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.
id="t-161104"&&Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.
id="t-164905"&&Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing: safety and security.
id="t-174141"&&The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS, can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security.
id="t-186348"&&Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population.
id="t-193347"&&But in general, providing social services fills a gap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power.
id="t-204040"&&For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work. 

id="t-212696"&&Now, this is a really complex picture, yet in the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side.
id="t-219821"&&But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength, strategy or long-term vision.
id="t-225393"&&These groups are hybrid.
id="t-226977"&&They rise because they fill a gap left by the government, and they emerge to be both armed and political, engage in violent struggle and provide governance. 

id="t-237431"&&And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.
id="t-244828"&&Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?
id="t-247131"&&They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
id="t-247131"&&They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
id="t-247131"&&They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
id="t-256720"&&Or maybe something else, something different and new?
id="t-260081"&&And what about ISIS?
id="t-261786"&&The lines are blurred.
id="t-263080"&&We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.
id="t-273799"&&This matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-military tools.
id="t-281202"&&Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
id="t-286150"&&This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
id="t-289813"&&If we better understand armed groups, we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence. 

id="t-298487"&&So in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability.
id="t-308085"&&To achieve these objectives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place. 

id="t-320220"&&Thank you. 

id="t-321395"&&(Applause)
