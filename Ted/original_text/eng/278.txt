id="t-825"&&A few years ago, my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.
id="t-6989"&&Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain.
id="t-14391"&&She had to file for disability.
id="t-16734"&&She stopped attending our local mosque.
id="t-19516"&&Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth.
id="t-24339"&&I wanted to help.
id="t-26500"&&But I didn't know how.
id="t-28716"&&I'm not a doctor. 

id="t-31005"&&So, what I am is a historian of medicine.
id="t-35930"&&So I started to research the history of chronic pain.
id="t-39957"&&Turns out, UCLA has an entire history of pain collection in their archives.
id="t-46593"&&And I found a story -- a fantastic story -- of a man who saved -- rescued -- millions of people from pain; people like my mom.
id="t-58772"&&Yet, I had never heard of him.
id="t-60256"&&There were no biographies of him, no Hollywood movies.
id="t-64483"&&His name was John J. Bonica.
id="t-69070"&&But when our story begins, he was better known as Johnny "Bull" Walker. 

id="t-76611"&&It was a summer day in 1941.
id="t-79857"&&The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.
id="t-85486"&&Spectators flocked to see the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns -- if they were lucky, the human cannonball.
id="t-92190"&&They also came to see the strongman, Johnny "Bull" Walker, a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.
id="t-100467"&&You know, on that particular day, a voice rang out over the circus P.A.
id="t-100467"&&You know, on that particular day, a voice rang out over the circus P.A.
id="t-105441"&&They needed a doctor urgently, in the live animal tent.
id="t-109302"&&Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer.
id="t-111710"&&The climax of his act had gone wrong, and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth.
id="t-119629"&&He was running out of air; the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out.
id="t-126788"&&When the lion finally did relax its jaws, the lion tamer just slumped to the ground, motionless.
id="t-135813"&&When he came to a few minutes later, he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.
id="t-141169"&&It was Bull Walker.
id="t-143816"&&The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life. 

id="t-150864"&&Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone, but he was actually a third-year medical student.
id="t-156788"&&He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition, but kept it a secret to protect his persona.
id="t-163787"&&He was supposed to be a brute, a villain -- not a nerdy do-gooder.
id="t-170535"&&His medical colleagues didn't know his secret, either.
id="t-173156"&&As he put it, "If you were an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."
id="t-177849"&&So he didn't tell them about the circus, or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends.
id="t-186353"&&He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker, or later, the Masked Marvel.
id="t-191627"&&He even kept it a secret that same year, when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world. 

id="t-201313"&&Over the years, John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives.
id="t-206515"&&He was a wrestler; he was a doctor.
id="t-209788"&&He was a heel; he was a hero.
id="t-213038"&&He inflicted pain, and he treated it.
id="t-217242"&&And he didnâ€™t know it at the time, but over the next five decades, he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain.
id="t-227620"&&It'd change modern medicine so much so, that decades later, Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father.
id="t-237351"&&But that all happened later. 

id="t-240179"&&In 1942, Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma, his sweetheart, whom he had met at one of his matches years before.
id="t-250505"&&He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.
id="t-253781"&&His internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.
id="t-259101"&&With his championship belt, he wrestled in big-ticket venues, like Madison Square Garden, against big-time opponents, like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall, or three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi. 

id="t-274192"&&The matches took a toll on his body; he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.
id="t-280295"&&One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face.
id="t-287302"&&The next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
id="t-287302"&&The next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
id="t-287302"&&The next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
id="t-299138"&&But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears.
id="t-304094"&&He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head.
id="t-309153"&&Pain just kept accumulating in his life. 

id="t-313177"&&Next, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital.
id="t-317509"&&She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.
id="t-321657"&&Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain.
id="t-327519"&&But the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job -- he was jittery, and in applying the ether, irritated Emma's throat.
id="t-336145"&&She vomited and choked, and started to turn blue.
id="t-340895"&&Bonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way, cleared her airway, and saved his wife and his unborn daughter.
id="t-352172"&&At that moment, he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology.
id="t-357414"&&Later, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers.
id="t-362850"&&But before he could focus on obstetrics, Bonica had to report for basic training. 

id="t-370373"&&Right around D-Day, Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center, near Tacoma.
id="t-376783"&&At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America.
id="t-382242"&&Bonica was in charge of all pain control there.
id="t-385618"&&He was only 27.
id="t-388470"&&Treating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned.
id="t-394976"&&Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way -- a body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm.
id="t-404538"&&But in some cases, like after a patient had a leg amputated, that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg.
id="t-414231"&&But if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing?
id="t-418861"&&There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever, and yet, still the patient hurt. 

id="t-426678"&&Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital -- surgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, others.
id="t-433782"&&And he tried to get their opinions on his patients.
id="t-437643"&&It took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch.
id="t-443123"&&It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain.
id="t-447613"&&No one had ever focused on pain this way before. 

id="t-452928"&&After that, he hit the books.
id="t-455845"&&He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on, carefully noting every mention of the word "pain."
id="t-462282"&&Out of the 14,000 pages he read, the word "pain" was on 17 and a half of them.
id="t-470908"&&Seventeen and a half.
id="t-472934"&&For the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient.
id="t-478875"&&Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him, he said, "What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there?
id="t-485484"&&The most important thing from the patient's perspective, they don't talk about."

id="t-491295"&&So over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it.
id="t-495209"&&He'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages.
id="t-498057"&&He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain.
id="t-502575"&&In it he proposed new strategies, new treatments using nerve-block injections.
id="t-509614"&&He proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic, based on those lunchtime meetings.
id="t-515248"&&But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine.
id="t-522486"&&A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives.
id="t-531321"&&He recast the very purpose of medicine.
id="t-535373"&&The goal wasn't to make patients better; it was to make patients feel better.
id="t-544955"&&He pushed his pain agenda for decades, before it finally took hold in the mid-'70s.
id="t-550831"&&Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world. 

id="t-555711"&&But as they did -- a tragic twist.
id="t-559754"&&Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him.
id="t-564597"&&He had been out of the ring for over 20 years, but those 1,500 professional bouts had left a mark on his body.
id="t-571769"&&Still in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis.
id="t-576360"&&Over the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries, including four spine operations, and hip replacement after hip replacement.
id="t-586110"&&He could barely raise his arm, turn his neck.
id="t-590144"&&He needed aluminum crutches to walk.
id="t-593879"&&His friends and former students became his doctors.
id="t-597923"&&One recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections than anyone else on the planet.
id="t-606043"&&Already a workaholic, he worked even more -- 15- to 18-hour days.
id="t-611922"&&Healing others became more than just his job, it was his own most effective form of relief.
id="t-618510"&&"If I wasn't as busy as I am," he told a reporter at the time, "I would be a completely disabled guy."

id="t-627423"&&On a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s, Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.
id="t-637338"&&They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion, with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage.
id="t-646895"&&The house belonged to the Zacchini family, who were something like American circus royalty.
id="t-654229"&&Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them, clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles, doing the act they pioneered -- the Human Cannonball.
id="t-664772"&&But now they were like him: retired.
id="t-669267"&&That generation is all dead now, including Bonica, so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day.
id="t-676475"&&But still, I love imagining it.
id="t-679233"&&The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited, showing off old scars, and new ones.
id="t-685802"&&Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.
id="t-688082"&&Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history, which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life. 

id="t-701286"&&Bonica saw pain close up.
id="t-701286"&&Bonica saw pain close up.
id="t-701286"&&Bonica saw pain close up.
id="t-708453"&&And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others.
id="t-713449"&&Out of that empathy, he spun a whole new field, played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself. 

id="t-722627"&&In that same oral history, Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience.
id="t-732215"&&That it involves your past life, your current life, your interactions, your family.
id="t-739256"&&That was definitely true for Bonica. 

id="t-742593"&&But it was also true for my mom.
id="t-748043"&&It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient, a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms.
id="t-759714"&&Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way.
id="t-765076"&&But as I saw Bonica's pain -- a testament to his fully lived life -- I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds.
id="t-778370"&&Before they got swollen and arthritic, my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R.
id="t-778370"&&Before they got swollen and arthritic, my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R.
id="t-789150"&&They folded samosas for our entire mosque.
id="t-794734"&&When I was a kid, they cut my hair, wiped my nose, tied my shoes. 

id="t-809832"&&Thank you. 

id="t-811181"&&(Applause)
