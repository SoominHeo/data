id="t-1440"&&Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River, Braddock, Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County, approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. 

id="t-16488"&&An industrial suburb, Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill, the Edgar Thomson Works.
id="t-25008"&&Operating since 1875, it is the last functioning steel mill in the region.
id="t-33390"&&For 12 years, I have produced collaborative portraits, still lifes, landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry, the environment, and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community. 

id="t-59277"&&The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions.
id="t-68727"&&Currently, the new narrative about Braddock, a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization, is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier.
id="t-82744"&&Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black.
id="t-89066"&&Our existence has been co-opted, silenced and erased. 

id="t-95731"&&Fourth generation in a lineage of women, I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby, off 8th Street at 805 Washington Avenue.
id="t-109562"&&She worked as a manager for Goodwill.
id="t-115020"&&Mom was a nurse's aid.
id="t-116814"&&She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments.
id="t-124708"&&By the time my generation walked the streets, disinvestment at the local, state and federal level, eroded infrastructure, and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. 

id="t-141890"&&Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension.
id="t-148994"&&He worked in high temperatures, tearing down and rebuilding furnaces, cleaning up spilt metal and slag.
id="t-157586"&&The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape.
id="t-165766"&&Areas of heavy truck traffic, exposure to benzene and atomized metals, risk cancer and lupus.
id="t-178390"&&One hundred twenty-three licensed beds, 652 employees, rehabilitation programs decimated.
id="t-191486"&&A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood.
id="t-201215"&&Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared.
id="t-207568"&&Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land.
id="t-221529"&&In 2013, I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession.
id="t-233371"&&In flight, my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco-friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. 

id="t-253500"&&My work spirals from the micro to the macro level, excavating hidden histories.
id="t-261688"&&Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum, Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition, and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice.
id="t-274133"&&Through reclamation of our narrative, we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. 

id="t-284179"&&Thank you. 

id="t-286370"&&(Applause)
