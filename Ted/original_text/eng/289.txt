id="t-854"&&The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral. 

id="t-6403"&&I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet, 

id="t-9793"&&dip both hands into holy water, 

id="t-11703"&&trace the trinity across my chest, 

id="t-13553"&&my tiny body drooping like a question mark 

id="t-16379"&&all over the wooden pew. 

id="t-18669"&&I asked Jesus to fix me, 

id="t-21339"&&and when he did not answer 

id="t-23465"&&I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn 

id="t-26141"&&and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue, 

id="t-29461"&&but shame lingered as an aftertaste. 

id="t-31376"&&And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity, 

id="t-34940"&&my mother told me of the miracle I was, 

id="t-37860"&&said I could grow up to be anything I want. 

id="t-40860"&&I decided to be a boy. 

id="t-44227"&&It was cute. 

id="t-45217"&&I had snapback, toothless grin, 

id="t-47007"&&used skinned knees as street cred, 

id="t-48847"&&played hide and seek with what was left of my goal. 

id="t-51277"&&I was it. 

id="t-52204"&&The winner to a game the other kids couldn't play, 

id="t-54629"&&I was the mystery of an anatomy, 

id="t-56809"&&a question asked but not answered, 

id="t-58622"&&tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl, 

id="t-62918"&&and when I turned 12, the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore. 

id="t-67655"&&It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts, 

id="t-73297"&&who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home, 

id="t-77546"&&that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing. 

id="t-81168"&&And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs. 

id="t-84999"&&Naturally, I did not come out of the closet. 

id="t-87716"&&The kids at my school opened it without my permission. 

id="t-90432"&&Called me by a name I did not recognize, 

id="t-92894"&&said "lesbian," 

id="t-94124"&&but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie. 

id="t-96700"&&It had nothing to do with hating my body, 

id="t-98903"&&I just love it enough to let it go, 

id="t-101023"&&I treat it like a house, 

id="t-102409"&&and when your house is falling apart, 

id="t-104239"&&you do not evacuate, 

id="t-105223"&&you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides, 

id="t-109015"&&you make it pretty enough to invite guests over, 

id="t-111376"&&you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. 

id="t-115904"&&My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. 

id="t-120919"&&As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington. 

id="t-126489"&&She fears that I'll die without a whisper, 

id="t-128700"&&that I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop. 

id="t-131763"&&She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum, 

id="t-134409"&&that I am a walking casket, 

id="t-136035"&&news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle, 

id="t-139239"&&Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body 

id="t-142995"&&becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages. 

id="t-146541"&&No one ever thinks of us as human 

id="t-149637"&&because we are more ghost than flesh, 

id="t-151795"&&because people fear that my gender expression is a trick, 

id="t-154494"&&that it exists to be perverse, 

id="t-156351"&&that it ensnares them without their consent, 

id="t-158394"&&that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands 

id="t-161088"&&and once they have fed off my queer, 

id="t-163387"&&they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like. 

id="t-166387"&&They'll put me back into the closet, hang me with all the other skeletons. 

id="t-170747"&&I will be the best attraction. 

id="t-173162"&&Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins, 

id="t-176241"&&to misspell their names on gravestones. 

id="t-178811"&&And people still wonder why there are boys rotting, 

id="t-181266"&&they go away in high school hallways 

id="t-183657"&&they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second 

id="t-186559"&&afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day 

id="t-190437"&&and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. 

id="t-197062"&&I wonder how long it will be 

id="t-198807"&&before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant, 

id="t-202487"&&before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin 

id="t-206110"&&way before we learn how to love them. 

id="t-208153"&&Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy, 

id="t-212077"&&like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet. 

id="t-215653"&&My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. 

id="t-220041"&&Maybe I am finally fixed, 

id="t-223175"&&maybe I just don't care, 

id="t-225428"&&maybe God finally listened to my prayers. 

id="t-230139"&&Thank you.
id="t-231604"&&(Applause)
