id="t-988"&&These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.
id="t-5701"&&They're bizzarre, they're beautiful, and there's very little we know about them. 

id="t-11841"&&These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.
id="t-18574"&&I was about five years old at the time, and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist.
id="t-25876"&&Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world. 

id="t-33941"&&And now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara.
id="t-42146"&&I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus. 

id="t-54451"&&A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.
id="t-64537"&&Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II.
id="t-69485"&&So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. 

id="t-73789"&&From these drawings, we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big, it had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail, and it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile, with conical teeth, that may have been used to catch slippery prey, like fish.
id="t-96647"&&But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years. 

id="t-106563"&&My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria, a place called the Kem Kem.
id="t-113938"&&It's a difficult place to work in.
id="t-116251"&&You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions, and it's very difficult to find good fossils there.
id="t-123084"&&But our hard work paid off.
id="t-125900"&&We discovered many incredible specimens.
id="t-128115"&&There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.
id="t-133475"&&We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs, and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters. 

id="t-145231"&&These fossils were deposited in a river system.
id="t-148233"&&The river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth, a monster sawfish, and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles.
id="t-161591"&&It was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. 

id="t-168159"&&So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus, but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive.
id="t-176538"&&We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. 

id="t-183640"&&Finally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus.
id="t-193431"&&We returned to the site, we collected more bones.
id="t-196291"&&And so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature.
id="t-202525"&&And we were able to reconstruct it. 

id="t-204196"&&We now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from the T. rex.
id="t-212818"&&But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.
id="t-217671"&&We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail.
id="t-221632"&&We had leg bones, we had skull bones, we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet -- again, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this -- and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment, or maybe for paddling in the water.
id="t-235943"&&We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact.
id="t-244136"&&Again, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water, it's useful for buoyancy control in the water. 

id="t-251186"&&We C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.
id="t-256559"&&And when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other.
id="t-263206"&&It's bigger than a T. rex, and yes, the head has "fish-eating" written all over it, but really the entire skeleton has "water-loving" written all over it -- dense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size, and again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water. 

id="t-282711"&&So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus -- I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin -- we realize that we're dealing with a river monster, a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants, feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. 

id="t-302503"&&So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery.
id="t-305369"&&It's a dinosaur like no other.
id="t-306874"&&And some people told me, "Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
id="t-310441"&&There are not many things left to discover in the world."
id="t-314803"&&Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth.
id="t-317975"&&I think the Sahara's still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said, "Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners."
id="t-335896"&&That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines.
id="t-339857"&&And it is still true today. 

id="t-341839"&&Thank you. 

id="t-342727"&&(Applause)
