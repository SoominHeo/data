id="t-1354"&&Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place.
id="t-6976"&&It was the 1970s.
id="t-9173"&&I got into the field very young: I was seven years old.
id="t-12383"&&And the tool that I used to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.
id="t-20810"&&This is a commercial for that particular item: (Video) Voice-over: What a jump!
id="t-24776"&&Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.
id="t-26767"&&That gyro-power sends him over 100 feet at top speed. 

id="t-29536"&&Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.
id="t-31628"&&I rode this motorcycle everywhere.
id="t-34587"&&And I was there with Evel Knievel; we jumped the Snake River Canyon together.
id="t-38847"&&I wanted the rocket.
id="t-40216"&&I never got the rocket, I only got the motorcycle.
id="t-45626"&&I felt so connected to this world.
id="t-48203"&&I didn't want to be a storyteller when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
id="t-48203"&&I didn't want to be a storyteller when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
id="t-48203"&&I didn't want to be a storyteller when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
id="t-55644"&&I had so much empathy for him. 

But it didn't work out.
id="t-78032"&&(Laughter) I went to art school.
id="t-63382"&&I started making music videos.
id="t-65792"&&And this is one of the early music videos that I made: (Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West) CM: You may notice some slight similarities here.
id="t-78032"&&(Laughter) And I got that rocket.
id="t-78032"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-85104"&&So, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker, and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience.
id="t-97831"&&And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own. 

id="t-105838"&&Unfortunately, Evel Knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him, and he sued us for this video -- (Laughter) -- shortly thereafter.
id="t-118110"&&On the upside, the man that I worshipped as a child, the man that I wanted to become as an adult, I was finally able to get his autograph.
id="t-130556"&&(Applause) 

id="t-137832"&&Let's talk about film now.
id="t-142849"&&Film, it's an incredible medium, but essentially, it's the same now as it was then.
id="t-149060"&&It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.
id="t-152529"&&And we've done incredible things with those rectangles.
id="t-156362"&&But I started thinking about, is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for 100 years?
id="t-173964"&&So I started experimenting, and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.
id="t-183054"&&And here's one of the early experiments: (Music) 

id="t-188412"&&So this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
id="t-190656"&&It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.
id="t-192712"&&It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it.
id="t-196362"&&It's a website.
id="t-197359"&&And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows.
id="t-202275"&&And you see this teenager running down a street, and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours.
id="t-209939"&&And when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.
id="t-215735"&&And this was great, and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that I had made in rectangles.
id="t-222631"&&And I'm essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story. 

id="t-229981"&&But then I started thinking, okay, well that's a part of you, but how do I put all of you inside of the frame?
id="t-238731"&&So to do that, I started making art installations.
id="t-241834"&&And this is one called "The Treachery of Sanctuary."
id="t-241834"&&And this is one called "The Treachery of Sanctuary."
id="t-241834"&&And this is one called "The Treachery of Sanctuary."
id="t-185588"&&(Music) So now I've got you inside of the frame, and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one. 

id="t-282080"&&But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?
id="t-286230"&&And a frame is just a window.
id="t-288487"&&I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema -- they're these windows into these other worlds.
id="t-288487"&&I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema -- they're these windows into these other worlds.
id="t-288487"&&I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema -- they're these windows into these other worlds.
id="t-296507"&&But I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window, I want you through the window, I want you on the other side, in the world, inhabiting the world. 

id="t-306218"&&So that leads me back to virtual reality.
id="t-309123"&&Let's talk about virtual reality.
id="t-105838"&&Unfortunately, talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.
id="t-318423"&&And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality.
id="t-78032"&&(Laughter) So, it's difficult to explain.
id="t-78032"&&(Laughter) So, it's difficult to explain.
id="t-331084"&&It's difficult because it's a very experiential medium.
id="t-334782"&&You feel your way inside of it.
id="t-336698"&&It's a machine, but inside of it, it feels like real life, it feels like truth.
id="t-341945"&&And you feel present in the world that you're inside and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with. 

id="t-347689"&&So, I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film: a full-screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality.
id="t-356209"&&So we're shooting in every direction.
id="t-358034"&&This is a camera system that we built that has 3D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction.
id="t-365987"&&We take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit.
id="t-371333"&&So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world, it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle.
id="t-378107"&&So this film is called "Clouds Over Sidra," and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations, and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.
id="t-390788"&&And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra.
id="t-398982"&&And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. 

id="t-408207"&&(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.
id="t-410720"&&I am 12 years old.
id="t-412616"&&I am in the fifth grade.
id="t-414418"&&I am from Syria, in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.
id="t-419605"&&I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half.
id="t-426923"&&I have a big family: three brothers, one is a baby.
id="t-431697"&&He cries a lot.
id="t-435142"&&I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not.
id="t-440197"&&I think I was a stronger baby than my brother. 

id="t-443821"&&CM: So, when you're inside of the headset.
id="t-446731"&&you're not seeing it like this.
id="t-448351"&&You're looking around through this world.
id="t-450423"&&You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions.
id="t-455711"&&And when you're sitting there in her room, watching her, you're not watching it through a television screen, you're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her.
id="t-464523"&&When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on.
id="t-468915"&&And because of that, you feel her humanity in a deeper way.
id="t-475054"&&You empathize with her in a deeper way. 

id="t-479590"&&And I think that we can change minds with this machine.
id="t-485917"&&And we've already started to try to change a few.
id="t-489690"&&So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.
id="t-494536"&&And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people.
id="t-501102"&&And these are people who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in Jordan.
id="t-509484"&&But in January, one afternoon in Switzerland, they suddenly all found themselves there.
id="t-130556"&&(Applause) And they were affected by it. 

id="t-529058"&&So we're going to make more of them.
id="t-532374"&&We're working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films.
id="t-537515"&&We just finished shooting a story in Liberia.
id="t-540187"&&And now, we're going to shoot a story in India.
id="t-543633"&&And we're taking these films, and we're showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there.
id="t-551023"&&And we're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. 

id="t-557274"&&And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality.
id="t-564614"&&It's not a video game peripheral.
id="t-566835"&&It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media.
id="t-574873"&&And it can change people's perception of each other.
id="t-578612"&&And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world. 

id="t-586604"&&So, it's a machine, but through this machine we become more compassionate, we become more empathetic, and we become more connected.
id="t-599667"&&And ultimately, we become more human. 

id="t-604491"&&Thank you. 

id="t-130556"&&(Applause)
