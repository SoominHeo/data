id="t-5504"&&When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.
id="t-11819"&&That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water.
id="t-18256"&&When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. 

id="t-25877"&&Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.
id="t-32457"&&Instead, it looks like this.
id="t-36438"&&If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
id="t-47792"&&Not missiles, but microbes.
id="t-51679"&&Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.
id="t-58081"&&But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.
id="t-64129"&&We're not ready for the next epidemic. 

id="t-68023"&&Let's look at Ebola.
id="t-69758"&&I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges.
id="t-75221"&&I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication.
id="t-83721"&&And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.
id="t-94589"&&In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. 

id="t-99028"&&We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.
id="t-107696"&&The case reports came in on paper.
id="t-110452"&&It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate.
id="t-115492"&&We didn't have a medical team ready to go.
id="t-117858"&&We didn't have a way of preparing people.
id="t-120453"&&Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
id="t-125784"&&But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries.
id="t-132022"&&And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
id="t-140752"&&There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.
id="t-145155"&&No one to look at the diagnostics.
id="t-146946"&&No one to figure out what tools should be used.
id="t-150243"&&As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.
id="t-159158"&&But that was never tried. 

id="t-161764"&&So there was a lot that was missing.
id="t-163520"&&And these things are really a global failure.
id="t-168305"&&The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.
id="t-175049"&&Now, in the movies it's quite different.
id="t-177842"&&There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood. 

id="t-190177"&&The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.
id="t-204311"&&About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries.
id="t-211846"&&There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.
id="t-214433"&&The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.
id="t-218874"&&They found the people and they prevented more infections.
id="t-222136"&&The second is the nature of the virus.
id="t-224621"&&Ebola does not spread through the air.
id="t-227697"&&And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden.
id="t-234220"&&Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.
id="t-238411"&&And that was just luck.
id="t-240115"&&If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger. 

id="t-245877"&&So next time, we might not be so lucky.
id="t-249466"&&You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market.
id="t-257842"&&The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism.
id="t-262826"&&So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. 

id="t-267474"&&In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
id="t-277630"&&So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.
id="t-283558"&&And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.
id="t-288683"&&So this is a serious problem.
id="t-290496"&&We should be concerned. 

id="t-292257"&&But in fact, we can build a really good response system.
id="t-296692"&&We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.
id="t-301836"&&We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them.
id="t-306140"&&We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.
id="t-310319"&&We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.
id="t-321322"&&So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.
id="t-327500"&&And we need preparedness. 

id="t-329793"&&The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war.
id="t-334758"&&For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.
id="t-339005"&&We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.
id="t-342316"&&NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.
id="t-346005"&&NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?
id="t-349455"&&Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies?
id="t-354241"&&So they are absolutely ready to go.
id="t-356779"&&So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. 

id="t-361134"&&What are the key pieces?
id="t-363301"&&First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.
id="t-368591"&&That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines.
id="t-373295"&&But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.
id="t-378154"&&We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise.
id="t-385853"&&And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.
id="t-390266"&&taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas.
id="t-396220"&&We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.
id="t-403927"&&The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.
id="t-410453"&&So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.
id="t-415490"&&Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
id="t-421609"&&There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly. 

id="t-429229"&&Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.
id="t-437095"&&The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.
id="t-449332"&&These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic.
id="t-454518"&&The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe. 

id="t-463502"&&So I think this should absolutely be a priority.
id="t-467514"&&There's no need to panic.
id="t-468980"&&We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.
id="t-473469"&&But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. 

id="t-477309"&&In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
id="t-489330"&&If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic. 

id="t-494978"&&Thank you. 

id="t-496574"&&(Applause)
