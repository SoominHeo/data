id="t-606"&&Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.
id="t-6519"&&After one trillion dollars in African development-related aid in the last 60 years, real per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.
id="t-18867"&&Aid is not doing too well. 

id="t-21170"&&In response, the Bretton Woods institutions -- the IMF and the World Bank -- pushed for free trade not aid, yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth. 

id="t-38561"&&The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit.
id="t-42460"&&We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.
id="t-50031"&&(Laughter) Yet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead. 

id="t-63615"&&My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.
id="t-67190"&&Let's invest in building pan-African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.
id="t-75061"&&Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98 and built it into a mobile cellular provider with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.
id="t-92076"&&The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model, which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.
id="t-99741"&&Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition. 

id="t-107624"&&Consider these two alternative scenarios.
id="t-111034"&&One: You loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market.
id="t-124295"&&Or two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.
id="t-141747"&&We invested in the second scenario, and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food.
id="t-158242"&&Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers, who have an ownership in the business.
id="t-170579"&&Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim, which requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships, and extraordinary perseverance. 

id="t-184525"&&But why pan-African?
id="t-187590"&&The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 -- where, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations: Liberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000.
id="t-211576"&&Pan-Africa gives you one billion people, granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments, but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us.
id="t-224282"&&The pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges, and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food.
id="t-235520"&&We hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs, develop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.
id="t-243948"&&While it's not the sexiest approach, and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good as giving a woman 100 dollars to buy a goat on kiva.org, perhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa can help change this. 

id="t-262364"&&The political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom.
id="t-271326"&&We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world-class businesses, creating indigenous wealth, providing jobs that we so desperately need, and hopefully helping achieve this. 

id="t-285792"&&Africa shall rise. 

id="t-288694"&&Thank you. 

id="t-290250"&&(Applause) 

id="t-297471"&&Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.
id="t-301465"&&You're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment.
id="t-308825"&&Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all? 

id="t-311277"&&Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.
id="t-313539"&&Microcredit has been a great, innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.
id="t-320063"&&But for the problems we face in Africa, when we are looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize war-torn Europe, it was not full of donations of sheep.
id="t-327904"&&We need more than just microcredit.
id="t-329626"&&We need more than just give 200 dollars.
id="t-331757"&&We need to build big businesses, and we need jobs. 

TR: Very good.
TR: Very good.

id="t-290250"&&(Applause)
