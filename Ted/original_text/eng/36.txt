id="t-6002"&&Rainn Wilson: It takes its toll, being alone.
id="t-9937"&&I'm a little bit lost, and it's finally time to make a real connection.
id="t-14663"&&Who am I? 

id="t-16171"&&(Drums) 

id="t-18495"&&I'm a single white male, 45 years of age.
id="t-22165"&&I love animals.
id="t-24283"&&Gainfully employed.
id="t-26860"&&I'm a people person.
id="t-29771"&&I keep fit.
id="t-32795"&&Who am I looking for?
id="t-34446"&&I'm looking for my idea mate.
id="t-37531"&&Are you that idea that matches with who I really am? 

id="t-40409"&&(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food?
id="t-44869"&&Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. 

id="t-52994"&&RW: Wow, we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date, huh? 

id="t-56273"&&RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do.
id="t-60075"&&People in these areas -- they're exposed to crappy food.
id="t-62767"&&I want people to know that growing your own food is like printing your own money. 

id="t-66631"&&RW: You're like a food superhero! 

id="t-68242"&&RF: Food is the problem and food is the solution.

id="t-72290"&&Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.
id="t-73897"&&My job is to put every word possible into the dictionary. 

id="t-77561"&&RW: I love words, too -- just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.
id="t-82517"&&What if you love a word that you've just made up, like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"? 

id="t-86914"&&Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality? 

id="t-88921"&&RW: Well, I'm a little nearsighted, but yeah. 

id="t-91252"&&BL: Well, you can't -- I mean, your brain has no access to this world.
id="t-94747"&&In fact, even the sensory information that your eyes are receiving, your ears are receiving, is completely meaningless because it could mean anything.
id="t-101883"&&That tree could be a large object far away or a small object up close, and your brain has no way of knowing. 

id="t-107931"&&RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd. 

id="t-111165"&&Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your closest living relatives.
id="t-115821"&&Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. 

id="t-121465"&&RW: I'm just curious: Do we have any conflict that needs managing or social issues to resolve? 

id="t-127467"&&IBI: Remember -- you're on a date with my idea, not me. 

id="t-133228"&&Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win. 

id="t-138240"&&RW: An epic win? 

id="t-139465"&&JM: An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive, you didn't even know it was possible until you achieved it. 

id="t-148331"&&You're not making the face.
id="t-152672"&&You're making the "I'm not good at life" face. 

id="t-155483"&&RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you.
id="t-155483"&&RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you.
id="t-155483"&&RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you.
id="t-159896"&&I'm dating around.
id="t-161077"&&That's the situation. 

id="t-162779"&&Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. 

id="t-169734"&&RW: Do you want to get some pie? 

id="t-171301"&&AB: Pi?
id="t-172479"&&3.14159265358979 -- 

id="t-176877"&&Reggie Watts: If we're going to do something, we've got to just make a decision.
id="t-181896"&&Because without a decision we're left powerless.
id="t-184465"&&Without power, we have nothing to supply the chain of those who are truly curious to solve all of our current conditions. 

id="t-194242"&&RW: And, "If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice" -- Rush. 

id="t-199172"&&JM: Yes!
id="t-200356"&&This is the face we need to see on millions of problem solvers worldwide, as we try to tackle the challenges of the next century. 

id="t-209149"&&RW: So, are we going Dutch? 

id="t-210497"&&AB: 3846264338327950 28841... 971? 

id="t-220458"&&RW: One night, want to go to a movie or something? 

RF: Hell, no!
RF: Hell, no!

id="t-224737"&&RW: Let's plant some shit!
id="t-226004"&&Good, now what is this that I'm planting? 

id="t-228005"&&Bonobos! 

IBI: Bonobos!
IBI: Bonobos!

id="t-231347"&&Bonobos. 

id="t-232720"&&RWatts: Um, interested much? 

id="t-236904"&&RW: I want to have your idea baby. 

id="t-239130"&&RWatts: Well, you know what they say in Russia. 

id="t-242121"&&RW: Hm? 

id="t-243300"&&RWatts: "scuberfinckle."
