id="t-1162"&&When I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative U.S. state I live in, Kansas.
id="t-10429"&&I didn't follow along with the crowd.
id="t-12742"&&I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.
id="t-16173"&&I was outspoken and extremely social.
id="t-19762"&&Even these pictures and postcards of my London semester abroad 16 years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.
id="t-32097"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-34681"&&But that same year I was in London, 16 years ago, I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique, and that changed everything.
id="t-49169"&&I became the opposite of who I thought I once was.
id="t-53079"&&I stayed in my room instead of socializing.
id="t-56005"&&I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.
id="t-60385"&&I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.
id="t-64260"&&I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing, not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.
id="t-71559"&&I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.
id="t-74580"&&After all, I was a bit unconventional.
id="t-77814"&&But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding. 

id="t-89728"&&Hiding is a progressive habit, and once you start hiding, it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.
id="t-99888"&&In fact, even now, when I was talking to people about what this talk was about, I made up a cover story and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk.
id="t-112388"&&So it is fitting and scary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding.
id="t-128093"&&What have I been hiding for 16 years?
id="t-134205"&&I am a lesbian. 

id="t-137602"&&(Applause) 

id="t-153513"&&Thank you. 

id="t-156038"&&I've struggled to say those words, because I didn't want to be defined by them.
id="t-161573"&&Every time I would think about coming out in the past, I would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana, uniquely Morgana, but not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana."
id="t-176439"&&Just Morgana. 

id="t-178893"&&For those of you from large metropolitan areas, this may not seem like a big deal to you.
id="t-184895"&&It may seem strange that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long.
id="t-191035"&&But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.
id="t-196818"&&And I'm not alone, of course.
id="t-199459"&&A 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity.
id="t-207078"&&Of all the employees they surveyed, 61 percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work.
id="t-217841"&&Of all the gay, lesbian and bisexual employees, 83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work "too gay."
id="t-232417"&&The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs, employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their long-term career advancement.
id="t-248496"&&And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves, I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions. 

id="t-269117"&&Twelve years: the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities compared to accepting communities.
id="t-284603"&&Twelve years reduced life expectancy.
id="t-289301"&&When I read that in The Advocate magazine this year, I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.
id="t-296904"&&The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.
id="t-304692"&&The study found that gays in anti-gay communities had higher rates of heart disease, violence and suicide.
id="t-313710"&&What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine.
id="t-325185"&&My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination. 

id="t-336192"&&I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay, but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas. 

id="t-356421"&&In February, the Kansas House of Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.
id="t-373063"&&A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.
id="t-381068"&&He voted in favor of the bill, in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me. 

id="t-394647"&&How does my friend feel about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people?
id="t-401922"&&How does her father feel?
id="t-404611"&&I don't know, because I was never honest with them about who I am.
id="t-410499"&&And that shakes me to the core.
id="t-413773"&&What if I had told her my story years ago?
id="t-417204"&&Could she have told her father my experience?
id="t-419853"&&Could I have ultimately helped change his vote?
id="t-424885"&&I will never know, and that made me realize I had done nothing to try to make a difference. 

id="t-435053"&&How ironic that I work in human resources, a profession that works to welcome, connect and encourage the development of employees, a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace, and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.
id="t-456779"&&When I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti-discrimination policies that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.
id="t-468777"&&Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.
id="t-474483"&&When I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.
id="t-480551"&&But I didn't.
id="t-482540"&&Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, I did nothing. 

id="t-137602"&&(Applause) 

id="t-507737"&&When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad 16 years ago, I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."
id="t-521547"&&"There are more scary things inside than outside."
id="t-525841"&&And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom: "Remember this."
id="t-531983"&&I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London, but the message I missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself.
id="t-543762"&&What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities.
id="t-556438"&&I believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.
id="t-565498"&&I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long.
id="t-574333"&&I hope that this means I will never hide again, and I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives.
id="t-153513"&&Thank you.
id="t-137602"&&(Applause)
