id="t-0"&&Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.
id="t-1876"&&That's a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants.
id="t-7552"&&I've been doing this for a long time, and I want to tell you, these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will.
id="t-18493"&&But also, these cultures, these indigenous cultures, are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves.
id="t-27024"&&And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar, it's not the harpy eagle, it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. 

id="t-39164"&&Now four years ago, I injured my foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor.
id="t-44147"&&She gave me heat, she gave me cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots.
id="t-53542"&&It didn't work.
id="t-55559"&&Several months later, I was in the northeast Amazon, walked into a village, and the shaman said, "You're limping."
id="t-64073"&&And I'll never forget this as long as I live.
id="t-66632"&&He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give me your machete."
id="t-72382"&&(Laughter) He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea.
id="t-85076"&&The pain disappeared for seven months.
id="t-88518"&&When it came back, I went to see the shaman again.
id="t-90444"&&He gave me the same treatment, and I've been cured for three years now.
id="t-95999"&&Who would you rather be treated by?
id="t-98671"&&(Applause) Now, make no mistake — Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised, but there's plenty of holes in it.
id="t-109470"&&Where's the cure for breast cancer?
id="t-111508"&&Where's the cure for schizophrenia?
id="t-113378"&&Where's the cure for acid reflux?
id="t-115772"&&Where's the cure for insomnia?
id="t-117969"&&The fact is that these people can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes cure things we cannot.
id="t-123570"&&Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis, a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world.
id="t-132824"&&Western treatment are injections of antimony.
id="t-135527"&&They're painful, they're expensive, and they're probably not good for your heart; it's a heavy metal.
id="t-141779"&&This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. 

id="t-145397"&&This is the magic frog.
id="t-147712"&&My colleague, the late great Loren McIntyre, discoverer of the source lake of the Amazon, Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes, was lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago.
id="t-158161"&&He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matsés.
id="t-162756"&&They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did.
id="t-166535"&&There, they took out palm leaf baskets.
id="t-168959"&&There, they took out these green monkey frogs — these are big suckers, they're like this — and they began licking them.
id="t-175962"&&It turns out, they're highly hallucinogenic.
id="t-178930"&&McIntyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of High Times magazine.
id="t-183832"&&You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures.
id="t-188183"&&This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl, or give it a lick, and he did, and he wrote, "My blood pressure went through the roof, I lost full control of my bodily functions, I passed out in a heap, I woke up in a hammock six hours later, felt like God for two days."
id="t-72382"&&(Laughter) An Italian chemist read this and said, "I'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog.
id="t-213583"&&What's this about the change in blood pressure?"
id="t-216168"&&Now, this is an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog, and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.
id="t-230160"&&How ironic if these isolated Indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures. 

id="t-235858"&&Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon, in the middle of a yage ceremony.
id="t-240960"&&I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture.
id="t-247462"&&This fellow looked at the medicine man, and he said, "You didn't go to medical school, did you?"
id="t-253207"&&The shaman said, "No, I did not."
id="t-255037"&&He said, "Well, then what can you know about healing?"
id="t-257668"&&The shaman looked at him and he said, "You know what?
id="t-257668"&&The shaman looked at him and he said, "You know what?
id="t-263248"&&But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit.
id="t-263248"&&But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit.
id="t-263248"&&But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit.
id="t-98671"&&(Applause) 

id="t-278550"&&But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines.
id="t-282058"&&This is a viper from Brazil, the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de São Paulo here.
id="t-287603"&&It was later developed into ACE inhibitors.
id="t-291054"&&This is a frontline treatment for hypertension.
id="t-293450"&&Hypertension causes over 10 percent of all deaths on the planet every day.
id="t-298458"&&This is a $4 billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake, and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.
id="t-306068"&&This is not an acceptable way of doing business. 

id="t-311056"&&The rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on Earth.
id="t-314670"&&There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love: "The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask."
id="t-322945"&&But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing.
id="t-325822"&&Here in Brazil, in the Amazon, around the world.
id="t-329335"&&I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here.
id="t-337502"&&The top half of the picture, you see where the Indians live.
id="t-340857"&&The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve.
id="t-344761"&&Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.
id="t-348239"&&Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows.
id="t-353996"&&Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs, bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change.
id="t-362546"&&In fact, the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. 

id="t-370411"&&But in talking about destruction, it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all.
id="t-378174"&&It's a place of beauty and wonder.
id="t-380626"&&The biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest, tips the scale at 90 pounds.
id="t-387468"&&The goliath bird-eating spider is the world's largest spider.
id="t-391467"&&It's found in the Amazon as well.
id="t-393768"&&The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet.
id="t-397656"&&And the black cayman — these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton.
id="t-403509"&&They're known to be man-eaters.
id="t-406858"&&The anaconda, the largest snake, the capybara, the largest rodent.
id="t-412375"&&A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at 201 pounds. 

id="t-417733"&&Let's visit where these creatures live, the northeast Amazon, home to the Akuriyo tribe.
id="t-423563"&&Uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination.
id="t-431211"&&These are the people who know nature best.
id="t-433548"&&These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature.
id="t-438457"&&By our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive.
id="t-441421"&&"They don't know how to make fire, or they didn't when they were first contacted."
id="t-445314"&&But they know the forest far better than we do.
id="t-448458"&&The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey, and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm.
id="t-457757"&&Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.
id="t-460072"&&When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans, Pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon in a small band, looking for game, looking for medicinal plants, looking for a wife, in other small nomadic bands.
id="t-478301"&&But it's people like these that know things that we don't, and they have lots of lessons to teach us. 

id="t-486832"&&However, if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon, there are no indigenous peoples.
id="t-492037"&&This is what you find: rock carvings which indigenous peoples, uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe.
id="t-501550"&&These cultures that once danced, made love, sang to the gods, worshipped the forest, all that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here. 

id="t-511434"&&Let's move to the western Amazon, which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples.
id="t-517091"&&Each of these dots represents a small, uncontacted tribe, and the big reveal today is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone. 

id="t-529762"&&Why are these people isolated?
id="t-532004"&&They know we exist, they know there's an outside world.
id="t-534711"&&This is a form of resistance.
id="t-536731"&&They have chosen to remain isolated, and I think it is their human right to remain so.
id="t-542439"&&Why are these the tribes that hide from man?
id="t-544862"&&Here's why.
id="t-545967"&&Obviously, some of this was set off in 1492.
id="t-549225"&&But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade.
id="t-553072"&&The demand for natural rubber, which came from the Amazon, set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush.
id="t-559802"&&Rubber for bicycle tires, rubber for automobile tires, rubber for zeppelins.
id="t-565047"&&It was a mad race to get that rubber, and the man on the left, Julio Arana, is one of the true thugs of the story.
id="t-573799"&&His people, his company, and other companies like them killed, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. 

id="t-585656"&&Even today, when people come out of the forest, the story seldom has a happy ending.
id="t-585656"&&Even today, when people come out of the forest, the story seldom has a happy ending.
id="t-585656"&&Even today, when people come out of the forest, the story seldom has a happy ending.
id="t-593906"&&Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.
id="t-597863"&&And remember, these are preliterate societies.
id="t-600095"&&The elders are the libraries.
id="t-601875"&&Every time a shaman dies, it's as if a library has burned down.
id="t-607042"&&They have been forced off their lands.
id="t-609538"&&The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands, and the Nukaks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia.
id="t-618981"&&From the Nukak lands, I want to take you to the southwest, to the most spectacular landscape in the world: Chiribiquete National Park.
id="t-626601"&&It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues, it has now expanded.
id="t-633717"&&It's bigger than the state of Maryland.
id="t-635694"&&It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity.
id="t-639135"&&It was first explored botanically in 1943 by my mentor, Richard Schultes, seen here atop the Bell Mountain, the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.
id="t-649185"&&And let me show you what it looks like today.
id="t-651476"&&Flying over Chiribiquete, realize that these lost world mountains are still lost.
id="t-655983"&&No scientist has been atop them.
id="t-657788"&&In fact, nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain since Schultes in '43.
id="t-661940"&&And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture.
id="t-667070"&&Let me show you what it looks like today. 

id="t-669760"&&Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity, not only is it home to three isolated tribes, but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre-Colombian art in the world: over 200,000 paintings.
id="t-683367"&&The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest. 

id="t-691697"&&But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast, again in the Colombian Amazon.
id="t-696082"&&Remember, the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England.
id="t-698964"&&The Amazon's a big forest, and Brazil's got a big part of it, but not all of it.
id="t-703698"&&Moving down to these two national parks, Cahuinari and Puré in the Colombian Amazon — that's the Brazilian border to the right — it's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples.
id="t-715587"&&To the trained eye, you can look at the roofs of these malocas, these longhouses, and see that there's cultural diversity.
id="t-721728"&&These are, in fact, different tribes.
id="t-723776"&&As isolated as these areas are, let me show you how the outside world is crowding in.
id="t-730595"&&Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo.
id="t-733316"&&With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia, the outside world is showing up.
id="t-738368"&&To the north, we have illegal gold mining, also from the east, from Brazil.
id="t-742812"&&There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes.
id="t-746452"&&We see illegal logging coming from the south, and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil.
id="t-754370"&&This, in the past, is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians.
id="t-758749"&&And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry, here's why.
id="t-72382"&&(Laughter) This looks like — (Applause) This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon.
id="t-774823"&&This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.
id="t-777566"&&A group called Los Carpinteros.
id="t-779223"&&This is their perception of why you shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. 

id="t-783574"&&But the world is changing.
id="t-785551"&&These are Mashco-Piros on the Brazil-Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people.
id="t-794792"&&And in Peru, there's a very nasty business.
id="t-797425"&&It's called human safaris.
id="t-799245"&&They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture.
id="t-802277"&&Of course, when you give them clothes, when you give them tools, you also give them diseases.
id="t-807221"&&We call these "inhuman safaris."
id="t-810068"&&These are Indians again on the Peru border, who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries.
id="t-815384"&&They want to get in there and turn them into Christians.
id="t-818315"&&We know how that turns out. 

id="t-820510"&&What's to be done?
id="t-822284"&&Introduce technology to the contacted tribes, not the uncontacted tribes, in a culturally sensitive way.
id="t-829745"&&This is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology.
id="t-836717"&&We've done this now with over 30 tribes, mapped, managed and increased protection of over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest.
id="t-98671"&&(Applause) 

id="t-851828"&&So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny.
id="t-858577"&&They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out.
id="t-862572"&&These are Indians, trained as indigenous park rangers, patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay.
id="t-869948"&&This is a picture of actual contact.
id="t-872707"&&These are Chitonahua Indians on the Brazil-Peru border.
id="t-876617"&&They've come out of the jungle asking for help.
id="t-880062"&&They were shot at, their malocas, their longhouses, were burned.
id="t-884205"&&Some of them were massacred.
id="t-886708"&&Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today, and it has to stop.
id="t-98671"&&(Applause) 

id="t-906205"&&But let me conclude by saying, this work can be spiritually rewarding, but it's difficult and it can be dangerous.
id="t-914636"&&Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane.
id="t-919903"&&They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes.
id="t-924429"&&So the question is, in conclusion, is what the future holds.
id="t-928191"&&These are the Uray people in Brazil.
id="t-930288"&&What does the future hold for them, and what does the future hold for us?
id="t-934640"&&Let's think differently.
id="t-937121"&&Let's make a better world.
id="t-938918"&&If the climate's going to change, let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse.
id="t-944919"&&Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation, in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation, can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose.
id="t-960013"&&Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. 

id="t-972235"&&Thanks again. 

id="t-98671"&&(Applause)
