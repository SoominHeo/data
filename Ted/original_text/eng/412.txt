id="t-587"&&Humanity takes center stage at TED, but I would like to add a voice for the animals, whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us. 

id="t-13112"&&Some years ago, it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver.
id="t-20860"&&His name is Jimmy Smith, and he shared a story with me that is told among his people, who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw. 

id="t-31035"&&Once upon a time, he told me, all animals on Earth were one.
id="t-36587"&&Even though they look different on the outside, inside, they're all the same, and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity.
id="t-50648"&&When they arrived, they would all take off their skins.
id="t-54920"&&Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur, and salmon her scales, and then, they would dance.
id="t-63829"&&But one day, a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand.
id="t-71838"&&Embarrassed, the animals fled, and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way. 

id="t-80556"&&The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one, has been a powerful inspiration to me.
id="t-89881"&&I like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scales.
id="t-94573"&&I want to get under the skin.
id="t-96801"&&No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye. 

id="t-108641"&&You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
id="t-108641"&&You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
id="t-108641"&&You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
id="t-124253"&&You just have to learn how to look past their disguise. 

id="t-128751"&&As a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing.
id="t-142239"&&When I use my camera, I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. 

id="t-153128"&&As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life.
id="t-163285"&&As citizens of a planet in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
id="t-174240"&&But as humans with hearts, we can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave. 

id="t-186760"&&Let's find a way to join the dance. 

id="t-191992"&&Thank you.
