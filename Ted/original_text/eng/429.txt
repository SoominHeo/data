id="t-5170"&&Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel.
id="t-13539"&&I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again playing music by this same composer.
id="t-19918"&&Let's take a look.

id="t-43960"&&(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.
id="t-45849"&&I actually live there, around the corner.
id="t-47457"&&and you'd be really welcome. 

Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun?

id="t-76722"&&(Applause) 

id="t-88236"&&Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. 

id="t-93810"&&Now you may ask, why have I done these things?
id="t-96330"&&They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life.
id="t-100913"&&Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. 

id="t-109829"&&It started a couple of years ago.
id="t-111944"&&I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little, when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.
id="t-111944"&&I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little, when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.
id="t-111944"&&I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little, when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.
id="t-124637"&&So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.
id="t-129020"&&And what happened next was that I entered this state of pure, unprejudiced amazement.
id="t-137360"&&It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music, and I had not felt that in a long time.
id="t-146607"&&It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.
id="t-150760"&&The first piece that I played through started like this. 

id="t-157845"&&(Music) 

id="t-182950"&&Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?
id="t-186680"&&And I turned the page and what came next was this. 

id="t-157845"&&(Music) 

id="t-218624"&&Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?
id="t-222690"&&So within a couple of minutes, and the piece isn't even finished yet, I experienced two very contrasting characters: beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.
id="t-235267"&&And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions.
id="t-240140"&&And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively. 

id="t-247893"&&I've given a lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight years old, and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven, even Stockhausen, or some jazzy music, they are open to hear it, really willing to listen, and they are comfortable doing so.
id="t-268716"&&And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that.
id="t-280640"&&The complexity of the music does become an issue, and actually the opinions of others — parents, friends, media — they start to count.
id="t-292823"&&But the young ones, they don't question their own opinion.
id="t-298672"&&They are in this constant state of wonder, and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children, even when growing up.
id="t-310112"&&And that is why I have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street, online, in the air: to feel that state of wonder, to truly listen, and to listen without prejudice.
id="t-327223"&&And I would like to invite you to do so now.
id="t-327223"&&And I would like to invite you to do so now.
id="t-327223"&&And I would like to invite you to do so now.

id="t-76722"&&(Applause) Thank you.
