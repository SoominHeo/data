id="t-792"&&We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy.
id="t-4485"&&I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.
id="t-7767"&&We get the people for whom nothing else has worked, people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets.
id="t-13254"&&They can't contain them, so we must.
id="t-15587"&&That's our job: contain them, control them. 

id="t-20137"&&Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very good at that, but that shouldn't make you happy.
id="t-28010"&&Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world.
id="t-31847"&&We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850.
id="t-36321"&&We house the parents of almost three million of our community's children, and we've become the new asylum, the largest mental health provider in this nation.
id="t-44862"&&When we lock someone up, that is no small thing.
id="t-47964"&&And yet, we are called the Department of Corrections.
id="t-51122"&&Today I want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections.
id="t-54605"&&I believe, and my experience tells me, that when we change the way we think, we create new possibilities, or futures, and prisons need a different future. 

id="t-63833"&&I've spent my entire career in corrections, over 30 years.
id="t-67305"&&I followed my dad into this field.
id="t-67305"&&I followed my dad into this field.
id="t-67305"&&I followed my dad into this field.
id="t-71930"&&He was strong, steady, disciplined.
id="t-74940"&&I was not so much any of those things, and I'm sure that worried him about me.
id="t-78779"&&Eventually I decided, if I was going to end up in prison, I'd better end up on the right side of the bars, so I thought I'd check it out, take a tour of the place my dad worked, the McNeil Island Penitentiary. 

id="t-89101"&&Now this was the early '80s, and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies.
id="t-94320"&&In many ways, it was worse.
id="t-96840"&&I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.
id="t-99454"&&There were eight men to a cell.
id="t-101079"&&there were 550 men in that living unit.
id="t-103427"&&And just in case you wondered, they shared one toilet in those small confines.
id="t-108376"&&An officer put a key in a lockbox, and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
id="t-112421"&&Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
id="t-114400"&&I walked away as fast as I could. 

id="t-116763"&&Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there.
id="t-119361"&&My job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men.
id="t-124319"&&When I went to work at our receptions center, I could actually hear the inmates roiling from the parking lot, shaking cell doors, yelling, tearing up their cells.
id="t-133058"&&Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up, and what you get is chaos.
id="t-137186"&&Contain and control â€” that was our job. 

id="t-139959"&&One way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type of housing unit called the Intensive Management Unit, IMU, a modern version of a "hole."
id="t-148016"&&We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them.
id="t-154160"&&Guess what?
id="t-156497"&&It got quieter.
id="t-157991"&&Disturbances died down in the general population.
id="t-160488"&&Places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated.
id="t-165864"&&But isolation isn't good.
id="t-167595"&&Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate.
id="t-170424"&&It was hard getting them out of IMU, for them and for us.
id="t-174912"&&Even in prison, it's no small thing to lock someone up. 

id="t-179367"&&My next assignment was to one of the state's deep-end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed.
id="t-184856"&&By then, the industry had advanced a lot, and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior.
id="t-190795"&&We had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields, flash bangs, emergency response teams.
id="t-197345"&&We met violence with force and chaos with chaos.
id="t-200670"&&We were pretty good at putting out fires. 

id="t-203197"&&While I was there, I met two experienced correctional workers who were also researchers, an anthropologist and a sociologist.
id="t-211225"&&One day, one of them commented to me and said, "You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.
id="t-214813"&&Have you ever thought about how to prevent them?"
id="t-218647"&&I was patient with them, explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer.
id="t-223790"&&They were patient with me.
id="t-225324"&&Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments.
id="t-229397"&&First, we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy.
id="t-235040"&&Instead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.
id="t-237350"&&Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff.
id="t-243200"&&They both got better at the work.
id="t-245713"&&Second, we added verbal de-escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum.
id="t-252950"&&It was the non-force use of force.
id="t-255434"&&And then we did something even more radical.
id="t-257036"&&We trained the inmates on those same skills.
id="t-259346"&&We changed the skill set, reducing violence, not just responding to it. 

id="t-264813"&&Third, when we expanded our facility, we tried a new type of design.
id="t-268047"&&Now the biggest and most controversial component of this design, of course, was the toilet.
id="t-274429"&&There were no toilets.
id="t-276118"&&Now that might not sound significant to you here today, but at the time, it was huge.
id="t-280134"&&No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.
id="t-282247"&&We all thought it was dangerous and crazy.
id="t-284495"&&Even eight men to a cell had a toilet.
id="t-287602"&&That small detail changed the way we worked.
id="t-290459"&&Inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport.
id="t-295463"&&It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated.
id="t-298610"&&The unit was cleaner, quieter, safer and more humane.
id="t-302246"&&This was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.
id="t-307960"&&Interacting changes the way you behave, both for the officer and the inmate.
id="t-311494"&&We changed the environment and we changed the behavior. 

id="t-314644"&&Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson, they assigned me to headquarters next, and that's where I ran straight up against system change.
id="t-321473"&&Now, many things work against system change: politics and politicians, bills and laws, courts and lawsuits, internal politics.
id="t-328919"&&System change is difficult and slow, and oftentimes it doesn't take you where you want to go.
id="t-334214"&&It's no small thing to change a prison system.
id="t-338236"&&So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders, the heat went down.
id="t-344164"&&When we changed the environment, the behavior changed.
id="t-346155"&&And these were not huge system changes.
id="t-347944"&&These were small changes, and these changes created new possibilities. 

id="t-351910"&&So next, I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison.
id="t-354617"&&And at the same time, I was working on my degree at the Evergreen State College.
id="t-358957"&&I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me, people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds.
id="t-364026"&&One of them was a rainforest ecologist.
id="t-366622"&&She looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory.
id="t-370158"&&We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn't complete on their own, like repopulating endangered species: frogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.
id="t-384020"&&At the same time, we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power, rainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.
id="t-392683"&&This initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system-wide impact, not just in our system, but in other state systems as well, small experiments making a big difference to science, to the community.
id="t-405475"&&The way we think about our work changes our work.
id="t-408642"&&The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
id="t-408642"&&The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
id="t-408642"&&The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
id="t-408642"&&The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
id="t-408642"&&The project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
id="t-415790"&&They were inspired.
id="t-417543"&&Everybody wanted to be part of this.
id="t-419099"&&They were making a contribution, a difference, one they thought was meaningful and important. 

id="t-423657"&&Let me be clear on what's going on here, though.
id="t-425513"&&Inmates are highly adaptive.
id="t-427256"&&They have to be.
id="t-428928"&&Oftentimes, they know more about our own systems than the people who run them.
id="t-433670"&&And they're here for a reason.
id="t-435321"&&I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them, but I do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison.
id="t-442623"&&So that was the question: Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives, and if so, what difference would that make?
id="t-450650"&&So I took that question back to the deep end, where some of our most violent offenders are housed.
id="t-456212"&&Remember, IMUs are for punishment.
id="t-457843"&&You don't get perks there, like programming.
id="t-459907"&&That was how we thought.
id="t-461837"&&But then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming, it was these particular inmates.
id="t-466237"&&In fact, they needed intensive programming.
id="t-468423"&&So we changed our thinking 180 degrees, and we started looking for new possibilities.
id="t-473124"&&What we found was a new kind of chair.
id="t-475662"&&Instead of using the chair for punishment, we put it in classrooms.
id="t-479278"&&Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control, but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face with other inmates and staff, and because control was no longer an issue, everybody could focus on other things, like learning.
id="t-479278"&&Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control, but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face with other inmates and staff, and because control was no longer an issue, everybody could focus on other things, like learning.
id="t-492772"&&We changed our thinking, and we changed what was possible, and this gives me hope. 

id="t-497607"&&Now, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.
id="t-500143"&&What I can tell you, though, it is working.
id="t-502735"&&Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates, and when our prisons are safe, we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling.
id="t-511013"&&Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal, but it's not our only goal.
id="t-514970"&&To be honest with you, preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions.
id="t-520208"&&If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime, I'm afraid we'll never get there.
id="t-525434"&&But prisons can do some things we never thought they could do.
id="t-528965"&&Prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability, repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration.
id="t-535740"&&Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers, dog rescuers.
id="t-540145"&&Prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff and the inmates who live there.
id="t-546976"&&We can contain and control and provide humane environments.
id="t-551273"&&These are not opposing qualities. 

id="t-553864"&&We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out if this is worth doing.
id="t-557752"&&Our strategy is not massive system change.
id="t-560446"&&Our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months, not years.
id="t-565935"&&We need more small pilots where we learn as we go, pilots that change the range of possibility.
id="t-572333"&&We need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement, on interaction, on safe environments.
id="t-578179"&&We need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities, your communities.
id="t-585120"&&Prisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.
id="t-588164"&&We can do that.
id="t-589147"&&Prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate, contribute, and learn meaningful lives.
id="t-594921"&&We're learning how to do that. 

id="t-596770"&&That's why I'm hopeful.
id="t-598220"&&We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.
id="t-598220"&&We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.
id="t-598220"&&We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.
id="t-602975"&&And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity, prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy.
id="t-608951"&&Maybe finally, we will earn our title: a department of corrections. 

id="t-614296"&&Thank you. 

id="t-616396"&&(Applause)
