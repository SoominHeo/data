id="t-860"&&I was born in Taiwan.
id="t-2595"&&I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, and I like going to night markets.
id="t-9467"&&I love the energy of the night markets, the colors, the lights, the toys, and all the unexpected things I find every time I go, things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks.
id="t-24494"&&When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart, any kind of toys I'd find around the house, like my brother's BB gun when he's not home. 

id="t-31562"&&I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play.
id="t-35668"&&In these early installations, I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags, and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house.
id="t-43202"&&I would take things like highlighter pen, mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy.
id="t-54286"&&I like these materials because of the way they look, the way they feel, and they're very affordable. 

id="t-60090"&&I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.
id="t-62916"&&I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button, get a different perspective, and see what it does.
id="t-72778"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-74940"&&I also like to modify household appliances.
id="t-77522"&&This is an automatic night light.
id="t-78820"&&Some of you might have them at home.
id="t-80434"&&I would cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use modeling clay, stick it onto the television, and then I would videotape my eye, and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, so you turn on the lightbulb.
id="t-94754"&&The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime, and it will shut off the light. 

id="t-101632"&&I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, so I built this device using bicycle helmets, some lightbulbs and television sets.
id="t-108880"&&It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes.
id="t-113596"&&This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures.
id="t-128829"&&This sculpture has four eyes.
id="t-130589"&&Each eye is controlling a different device.
id="t-132757"&&This eye is turning itself around in a television.
id="t-136237"&&This eye is inflating a plastic tube.
id="t-138653"&&This eye is watching a video of another piece being made.
id="t-142229"&&And these two eyes are activating glowing water.
id="t-146191"&&Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions around the world. 

id="t-152867"&&I love science and biology.
id="t-155230"&&In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.

id="t-155230"&&In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.
id="t-165677"&&They're soft, they're slimy, and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment, either to attract mates, for self-defense, or to attract food.
id="t-176818"&&This research inspired my work in many different ways, things like movement or different light patterns.
id="t-186184"&&So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out, trying that out, and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.
id="t-195995"&&I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens.
id="t-201755"&&This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures, some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.
id="t-208846"&&From afar, they look alien-like, but when you look closer, they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers. 

id="t-214950"&&I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous.
id="t-234710"&&(Applause) Thank you.
