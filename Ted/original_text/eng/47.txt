id="t-868"&&The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques, if we are able to dream. 

id="t-10991"&&As a child, I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality.
id="t-21570"&&I learned this from my grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer, a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes.
id="t-31729"&&That is how I grew up: encouraged to see beyond any limitation.
id="t-38982"&&So part of my education included helping her in remote, indigenous communities.
id="t-45864"&&I cherish those memories, because they helped me to understand life outside the city, a life with a lot of possibilities, without barriers, as language or culture. 

id="t-61780"&&During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem: "Something hidden.
id="t-61780"&&During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem: "Something hidden.
id="t-70296"&&Go and look behind the Mountains.
id="t-72978"&&Something lost behind the mountains.
id="t-72978"&&Something lost behind the mountains.
id="t-72978"&&Something lost behind the mountains.

id="t-81624"&&In the coming years, I became a medical student.
id="t-86299"&&One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease.
id="t-95214"&&There's a part of this problem I think I can solve -- the part of this problem I have spent my life working on. 

id="t-107904"&&The problem starts during pregnancy.
id="t-112610"&&The fetus needs to survive inside the mother.
id="t-116808"&&Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood.
id="t-124994"&&At the moment of birth, this communication needs to stop.
id="t-130474"&&If it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart.
id="t-135398"&&It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions.
id="t-140537"&&But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes.
id="t-149119"&&As you can see in the chart, the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude. 

id="t-160327"&&Video: (Baby crying) 

id="t-164357"&&When you look at patients with this condition, they seem desperate to breathe.
id="t-170521"&&To close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution. 

id="t-176527"&&One night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region.
id="t-182385"&&The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch.
id="t-189088"&&Then came a moment of inspiration.
id="t-192513"&&So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention.
id="t-197110"&&The holes in children's hearts can be closed with it.
id="t-200509"&&A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself.
id="t-205313"&&It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now, but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem.
id="t-217671"&&In this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart.
id="t-223393"&&The coil then closes the hole.
id="t-225721"&&After that moment of inspiration, there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype.
id="t-236495"&&In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab.
id="t-243321"&&The coil, if it works, can save lives. 

id="t-248202"&&I returned from Germany to Bolivia, thinking that wherever we go, we have the opportunity to make a difference.
id="t-257278"&&With my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath, we started to see patients.
id="t-263492"&&After successfully treating patients with our coil, we felt really enthusiastic.
id="t-270688"&&But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high.
id="t-279694"&&And, the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition.
id="t-287865"&&The hole in altitude patients is different, because the orifice between the arteries is larger.
id="t-294479"&&Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time, and they die.
id="t-301973"&&The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia.
id="t-311577"&&The search started again.
id="t-314942"&&We went back to the drawing board. 

id="t-319574"&&After many trials, and with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains, we obtained a new device.
id="t-328753"&&For centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms, and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device.
id="t-341673"&&We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape.
id="t-351236"&&It seems this time, the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn't rust because it's made of only one piece.
id="t-365427"&&It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop. 

id="t-374903"&&As you can see, the device enters the body through the natural channels.
id="t-380173"&&Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole.
id="t-384104"&&Our device expands, places itself and closes the hole.
id="t-390375"&&We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself.
id="t-398422"&&No open surgery was necessary. 

id="t-403494"&&(Applause) 

id="t-412006"&&As doctors, we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal -- if they do.
id="t-419443"&&This is the child from before, after the procedure.
id="t-423780"&&As you can see -- 

id="t-403494"&&(Applause) 

id="t-430007"&&As you can see, once the device is in place, the patient is 100 percent healed.
id="t-436622"&&From start to finish, the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.
id="t-443183"&&That's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view.
id="t-448444"&&We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team -- a team, thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us.
id="t-465799"&&Together, we have only one idea: the best solutions need to be simple.
id="t-473530"&&We lost the fear of creating something new. 

id="t-477523"&&The path, it's not easy.
id="t-480191"&&Many obstacles arise all the time.
id="t-483934"&&But we receive strength from our patients.
id="t-487971"&&Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity.
id="t-495311"&&Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind, not because of cost or access. 

id="t-507367"&&So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model.
id="t-513831"&&We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated.
id="t-521600"&&We are in many countries now, but we need to be everywhere.
id="t-528926"&&This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it, really: No child is left behind. 

id="t-543670"&&Muchas gracias. 

id="t-403494"&&(Applause)
