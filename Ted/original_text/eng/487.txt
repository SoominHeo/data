id="t-703"&&Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells 

id="t-6316"&&And announced that I'm "articulate" 

id="t-11364"&&Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction 

id="t-15697"&&I don't even think of it 

id="t-16703"&&‘Cause I’m "articulate" 

id="t-19390"&&So when my professor asks a question 

id="t-21970"&&And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion 

id="t-25477"&&There’s no misdirected intention 

id="t-27943"&&Pay attention 

id="t-28920"&&‘Cause I’m “articulate” 

id="t-31258"&&So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?” 

id="t-34815"&&My “articulate” answer never goes amiss 

id="t-37953"&&I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand” 

id="t-41469"&&And when I’m on the block I switch it up just because I can 

id="t-44491"&&So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?” 

id="t-47129"&&I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!” 

id="t-52539"&&And sometimes in class 

id="t-54131"&&I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask 

“Yo!
“Yo!

id="t-60725"&&Yes, I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals 

id="t-64952"&&Because I’m “articulate” 

id="t-68950"&&But who controls articulation? 

id="t-71371"&&Because the English language is a multifaceted oration 

id="t-74525"&&Subject to indefinite transformation 

id="t-76344"&&Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English 

id="t-79957"&&But I’m here to tell you that even “articulate” Americans sound foolish to the British 

id="t-85114"&&So when my Professor comes on the block and says, “Hello” 

id="t-88363"&&I stop him and say “Noooo … 

id="t-91000"&&You’re being inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’” 

id="t-95307"&&Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool 

id="t-98922"&&But I’m here to tell you that even our language has rules 

id="t-101900"&&So when Mommy mocks me and says “ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store” 

id="t-106770"&&I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law 

id="t-111756"&&Never does the word "madd" go before a present participle 

id="t-115447"&&That’s simply the principle of this English” 

id="t-117950"&&If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop, 

id="t-121674"&&From every suburbia, and every hood 

id="t-123950"&&‘Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis 

id="t-127503"&&Of this world saying “it is good" 

id="t-129220"&&So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech 

id="t-133185"&&But do not judge me by my language and assume 

id="t-135716"&&That I’m too ignorant to teach 

id="t-137235"&&‘Cause I speak three tongues 

id="t-138785"&&One for each: 

id="t-139933"&&Home, school and friends 

id="t-141678"&&I’m a tri-lingual orator 

id="t-143882"&&Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now 

id="t-145851"&&Then switch it up so I don’t bore later 

id="t-147810"&&Sometimes I fight back two tongues 

id="t-149687"&&While I use the other one in the classroom 

id="t-151622"&&And when I mistakenly mix them up 

id="t-153547"&&I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom 

id="t-157040"&&I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen 

id="t-164477"&&But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken 

id="t-169879"&&These words are spoken 

id="t-171398"&&By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season 

id="t-176325"&&And the reason I speak a composite version of your language 

id="t-179808"&&Is because mines was raped away along with my history 

id="t-183560"&&I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us 

id="t-187790"&&That our current state is not a mystery 

id="t-190050"&&I’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad 

id="t-195258"&&So unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad 

id="t-199501"&&I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity 

id="t-203157"&&So don’t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity 

id="t-207255"&&As much as has been raped away from our people 

id="t-212182"&&How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language 

id="t-216121"&&As anything less than equal 

id="t-218735"&&Let there be no confusion 

id="t-220607"&&Let there be no hesitation 

id="t-222421"&&This is not a promotion of ignorance 

id="t-224485"&&This is a linguistic celebration 

id="t-227930"&&That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application 

id="t-233009"&&I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know 

id="t-237372"&&And when they call me for the interview I’ll be more than happy to show that 

id="t-240615"&&I can say: 

id="t-241350"&&“What’s good” 

id="t-242563"&&“Whatagwan” 

id="t-243548"&&And of course …“Hello” 

id="t-64952"&&Because I’m “articulate” 

id="t-249126"&&Thank you. 

id="t-250899"&&(Applause)
