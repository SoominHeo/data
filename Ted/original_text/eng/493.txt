id="t-531"&&It was less than a year after September 11, and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders, and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed.
id="t-9900"&&I had done some activism in college, so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing.
id="t-15838"&&I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive, but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever, and we were all arrested.
id="t-24118"&&Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence. 

id="t-29556"&&My charges were dismissed, but a few weeks later, two FBI agents knocked on my door, and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups, they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
id="t-42272"&&I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch, but I was terrified, and when my fear subsided, I became obsessed with finding out how this happened, how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat. 

id="t-60726"&&A few years later, I was invited to testify before Congress about my reporting, and I told lawmakers that, while everybody is talking about going green, some people are risking their lives to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.
id="t-73333"&&They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
id="t-78807"&&These are everyday people, like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing.
id="t-89106"&&And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular, so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word, eco-terrorist, to shift how we view them.
id="t-101269"&&They just made it up. 

id="t-103156"&&Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits.
id="t-113319"&&Now most people never even heard about this law, including members of Congress.
id="t-118444"&&Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House.
id="t-122815"&&The rest were outside at a new memorial.
id="t-125718"&&They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment. 

id="t-134456"&&Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists: the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
id="t-141191"&&But right now, companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists.
id="t-151605"&&The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence, they're about public relations.
id="t-159492"&&Today, in multiple countries, corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms.
id="t-167927"&&The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago, and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism. 

id="t-176527"&&The first of these ag-gag prosecutions, as they're called, was a young woman named Amy Meyer, and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street.
id="t-188528"&&And Amy did what any of us would: She filmed it.
id="t-192514"&&When I found out about her story, I wrote about it, and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. 

id="t-201738"&&But apparently, even exposing stuff like that is a threat.
id="t-205576"&&Through the Freedom of Information Act, I learned that the counter-terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one.
id="t-213463"&&They even included this nice little write-up of my book.
id="t-215689"&&They described it as "compelling and well-written."
id="t-218804"&&(Applause) Blurb on the next book, right? 

id="t-226760"&&The point of all of this is to make us afraid, but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith in the power of education.
id="t-234120"&&Our best weapon is sunlight. 

id="t-237687"&&Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
id="t-242899"&&Over and over throughout history, people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent.
id="t-250248"&&It's time we strike a new note. 

id="t-252287"&&Thank you. 

id="t-218804"&&(Applause)
