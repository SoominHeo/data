id="t-1140"&&The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do: without me, and not online.
id="t-9911"&&On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal, Alfred Nobel, died.
id="t-14654"&&One hundred years later, exactly, actually, December 10, 1996, this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska, won the Nobel Prize for literature.
id="t-22636"&&She's a Polish poet.
id="t-24277"&&She's a big deal, obviously, but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her, and when I checked out her work, I found this sweet little poem, "Four in the Morning."

id="t-32780"&&"The hour from night to day.
id="t-34045"&&The hour from side to side.
id="t-35431"&&The hour for those past thirty..." 

id="t-37229"&&And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem, I fell for it hard, so hard, I suspected we must have met somewhere before.
id="t-45593"&&Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?
id="t-47892"&&Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere?
id="t-50557"&&I could not place it, and it bugged me, and then in the coming week or two, I would just be watching an old movie, and this would happen. 

id="t-56702"&&(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you should have come to the first party.
id="t-57965"&&We didn't get home till around four in the morning. 

id="t-60317"&&Rives: My roommates would have the TV on, and this would happen. 

id="t-64271"&&(Music: Seinfeld theme) 

id="t-65890"&&(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy. 

id="t-70360"&&Rives: I would be listening to music, and this would happen. 

(Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it.
(Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it.

id="t-75938"&&Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?
id="t-78139"&&Obviously, the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me.
id="t-82818"&&Some people get a number stuck in their head, you may recognize a certain name or a tune, some people get nothing, but four in the morning was in me now, but mildly, like a groin injury.
id="t-94114"&&I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually, and I never talked about it with anybody, but it did not, and I totally did. 

id="t-102233"&&In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED for the second time, and since I was still an authority on nothing, I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie.
id="t-115971"&&So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples, but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year.
id="t-122581"&&I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende.
id="t-125311"&&I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.
id="t-128998"&&I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening, although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser.
id="t-137382"&&However, had Matt been there, he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.
id="t-146563"&&It was totally contrived just for that room, just for that moment.
id="t-149740"&&That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
id="t-149740"&&That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
id="t-149740"&&That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.

id="t-154556"&&When I got home, though, the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live, beginning with, and this is still my favorite, "Here's another one for your collection: 'It's the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"
id="t-165571"&&The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.
id="t-167411"&&The email itself was from another very sexy European type, TED Curator Chris Anderson.
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something, and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.
id="t-183809"&&I am contagious, which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation.
id="t-192692"&&As a bonus, she hooked me up with a second one they make.
id="t-195929"&&It says, "Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to," which I love, because together these are like, "Hallmark: When you care enough to send the very best twice, phrased slightly differently."

id="t-207406"&&I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap.
id="t-213050"&&A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.
id="t-215075"&&"It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap."

id="t-218135"&&I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.
id="t-221877"&&More than one person sent me this. 

id="t-223637"&&(Video) Didi Pickles: It's four o'clock in the morning.
id="t-225516"&&Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding? 

id="t-227748"&&Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life. 

id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-232010"&&Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic. 

(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up!
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up!
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up!

Roy: No, it's not an accident.
Roy: No, it's not an accident.

id="t-243847"&&Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning. 

id="t-245983"&&Rives: So that's "Close Encounters," and the main character is all worked up because aliens, momentously, have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning, which does make that a very solid example.
id="t-254319"&&Those were all really solid examples.
id="t-256343"&&They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
id="t-256343"&&They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
id="t-256343"&&They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
id="t-256343"&&They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
id="t-256343"&&They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
id="t-269919"&&Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before.
id="t-273439"&&Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something. 

id="t-276255"&&Just when things were getting pretty interesting, things got really interesting.
id="t-280636"&&TED.com launched, later that year, with a bunch of videos from past talks, including mine, and I started receiving "four in the morning" citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet.
id="t-291160"&&Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it, and I was not.
id="t-296833"&&I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.
id="t-298480"&&I probably would have missed the booklet, "Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) I do not subscribe to Crochet Today!
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) I do not subscribe to Crochet Today!
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) Take note of those clock ends.
id="t-313279"&&This is a college student's suggestion for what a "four in the morning" gang sign should look like.
id="t-318639"&&People sent me magazine ads.
id="t-320727"&&They took photographs in grocery stores.
id="t-322810"&&I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.
id="t-326277"&&A lot of good quality work, too: "The Sandman," "Watchmen."
id="t-329650"&&There's a very cute example here from "Calvin and Hobbes."
id="t-332081"&&In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.
id="t-337621"&&Take a look. 

id="t-339283"&&(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early? 

id="t-341170"&&Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early. 

id="t-344287"&&Rives: And the flip side of the timeline, this is from the 31st century.
id="t-347572"&&A thousand years from now, people are still doing this. 

id="t-351565"&&(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m. (Laughter) Rives: It shows the spectrum.
id="t-356386"&&I received so many songs, TV shows, movies, like from dismal to famous, I could give you a four-hour playlist.
id="t-364362"&&If I just stick to modern male movie stars, I keep it to the length of about a commercial.
id="t-369268"&&Here's your sampler. 

id="t-370998"&&(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.") 

id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-400384"&&Rives: So somewhere along the line, I realized I have a hobby I didn't know I wanted, and it is crowdsourced.
id="t-408960"&&But I was also thinking what you might be thinking, which is really, couldn't you do this with any hour of the day? 

id="t-414050"&&First of all, you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon.
id="t-417272"&&Secondly, I did a little research.
id="t-418976"&&You know, I was kind of interested.
id="t-420448"&&If this is confirmation bias, there is so much confirmation, I am biased.
id="t-425267"&&Literature probably shows it best.
id="t-426513"&&There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare.
id="t-428657"&&There's a five in the morning.
id="t-430000"&&There are seven four in the mornings, and they're all very dire.
id="t-432241"&&In "Measure for Measure," it's the call time for the executioner.
id="t-435592"&&Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in "War and Peace."
id="t-442030"&&Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning, as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."
id="t-448103"&&"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.
id="t-451301"&&"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.
id="t-451301"&&"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.
id="t-451301"&&"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.
id="t-458130"&&Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."
id="t-461241"&&"The Great Gatsby" spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows, and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps, "The Metamorphosis."
id="t-471569"&&First paragraph, the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach, but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding, something is up with this guy.
id="t-471569"&&First paragraph, the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach, but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding, something is up with this guy.
id="t-471569"&&First paragraph, the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach, but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding, something is up with this guy.
id="t-483810"&&What kind of person would do that?
id="t-487159"&&This kind of person would do that. 

id="t-489178"&&(Music) 

id="t-493490"&&(4 a.m. alarm clock montage) (Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.
id="t-493490"&&(4 a.m. alarm clock montage) (Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.
id="t-501395"&&But of course, there is no news yet.
id="t-502649"&&Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds. 

id="t-505974"&&Rives: Exactly.
id="t-507474"&&So that's Lucy from the Peanuts, "Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training, Nelson Mandela, first day in office, and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category, people waking up, in my big old database. 

id="t-523350"&&Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears, and they send them to you.
id="t-530259"&&Even if you don't really, at a certain point, you totally collect stuffed polar bears, and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.
id="t-538710"&&And when I got to that point, I embraced it.
id="t-538710"&&And when I got to that point, I embraced it.
id="t-538710"&&And when I got to that point, I embraced it.
id="t-546289"&&I started archiving.
id="t-547660"&&My hobby had become a habit, and my habit gave me possibly the world's most eclectic Netflix queue.
id="t-555421"&&At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical," "Last Tango in Paris," "Diary of a Wimpy Kid," "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."
id="t-562623"&&Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?
id="t-564523"&&Because someone told me I would find this clip in there. 

id="t-567183"&&(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born in Flushing, Queens on March, 12, 1953, at four o'clock in the morning. 

Rives: Of course he was.
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Yeah.
id="t-174941"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Yeah.
id="t-586701"&&Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence, "I was born at four o'clock in the morning," which I had because someone else had emailed it to me, and when they did, I had another bump up in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people.
id="t-602309"&&They are different people that have this thing connecting them, and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder, is there maybe a cooler way to do this? 

id="t-613070"&&So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition, I put the entire collection online as "Museum of Four in the Morning."
id="t-621428"&&You can click on that red "refresh" button.
id="t-623426"&&It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.
id="t-628008"&&Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."

id="t-632149"&&(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.
id="t-639380"&&No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. 

id="t-647798"&&Rives: So the first hour of this project was satisfying.
id="t-652222"&&A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
id="t-656922"&&Half a globe away, a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me, a stranger. 

id="t-662910"&&Less than a week later, though, I received a little bit of grace.
id="t-667344"&&I received a poignant tweet.
id="t-671606"&&It was brief.
id="t-673528"&&It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."

id="t-677670"&&The name was a pseudonym, actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.
id="t-680268"&&As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic, I knew immediately, my whole body knew immediately who this was, and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about.
id="t-489178"&&(Music) 

L.D.
L.D.
L.D.
L.D.
id="t-701841"&&She was a grad student in the library sciences department.
id="t-705159"&&Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off, lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.
id="t-709408"&&She was already smoking hot, she was super dorky, and we had a December-May romance, meaning we started dating in December, and by May, she had graduated and became my one that got away. 

id="t-722581"&&But her mix tape did not get away.
id="t-726728"&&I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards, not just from L.D., from my life, but for decades.
id="t-735000"&&It's the kind of box where, if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her, and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her, but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side, but no song titles.
id="t-735000"&&It's the kind of box where, if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her, and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her, but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side, but no song titles.

id="t-755664"&&When I got this mix tape, I put it in my cassette player, I took it to the campus library, her library, I found 14 books on the shelves.
id="t-764160"&&I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table, and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine, paired, I can tell you, like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress. 

id="t-779589"&&I did this again last October.
id="t-781993"&&I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds, old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant.
id="t-790787"&&And then I thought, "Good for him."

id="t-794212"&&"PG" is Slavic literature.
id="t-797555"&&"7000" series Polish literature.
id="t-800603"&&Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.
id="t-803253"&&Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem paired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."
