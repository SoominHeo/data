id="t-1020"&&Let me introduce you to something I've been working on.
id="t-4652"&&It's what the Victorian illusionists would have described as a mechanical marvel, an automaton, a thinking machine.
id="t-14355"&&Say hello to EDI.
id="t-14355"&&Say hello to EDI.
id="t-14355"&&Say hello to EDI.
id="t-18972"&&EDI, EDI. 

id="t-22943"&&These mechanical performers were popular throughout Europe.
id="t-27280"&&Audiences marveled at the way they moved.
id="t-29980"&&It was science fiction made true, robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age, machines far in advance of anything that Victorian technology could create, a machine we would later know as the robot. 

EDI: Robot.
EDI: Robot.
id="t-54148"&&It comes from "robota."
id="t-56260"&&It means "forced labor."

id="t-59613"&&Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.
id="t-62342"&&They were not intelligent.
id="t-64024"&&They were illusions, a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.
id="t-72537"&&EDI is different.
id="t-74512"&&EDI is real. 

id="t-76106"&&EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall. 

id="t-78156"&&MT: He weighs 300 pounds. 

id="t-80076"&&EDI: I have two seven-axis arms — 

id="t-82718"&&MT: Core of sensing — 

id="t-84101"&&EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system, and come complete with a warranty. 

id="t-89581"&&MT: We love robots. 

EDI: Hi.
EDI: Hi.
EDI: Hi.

id="t-94634"&&MT: We are intrigued by the possibility of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.
id="t-100162"&&We build them so they look like us, behave like us, and think like us.
id="t-106138"&&The perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human, and that scares us.
id="t-112956"&&In the first story about robots, they turn against their creators.
id="t-117535"&&It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction. 

EDI: Ha ha ha.
EDI: Ha ha ha.
EDI: Ha ha ha.
EDI: Ha ha ha.

id="t-130484"&&MT: As I was saying, besides the faces and bodies we give our robots, we cannot read their intentions, and that makes us nervous.
id="t-139316"&&When someone hands an object to you, you can read intention in their eyes, their face, their body language.
id="t-145529"&&That's not true of the robot.
id="t-147809"&&Now, this goes both ways. 

id="t-151069"&&EDI: Wow! 

id="t-152485"&&MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions. 

id="t-155540"&&EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable, not to mention irrational.
id="t-161071"&&I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next, you know, but it scares me. 

id="t-166459"&&MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult to work in close proximity.
id="t-171271"&&Accidents are inevitable. 

EDI: Ow!
EDI: Ow!

MT: Sorry.
MT: Sorry.
id="t-181391"&&Much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels, we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends.
id="t-192247"&&With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI a magic trick.
id="t-192247"&&With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI a magic trick.
id="t-192247"&&With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI a magic trick.
id="t-201066"&&Abracadabra. 

id="t-203142"&&MT: Abracadabra? 

EDI: Yeah.
EDI: Yeah.
id="t-207560"&&Come on, keep up. 

id="t-209228"&&MT: Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality.
id="t-213581"&&Technology can do the same.
id="t-220860"&&Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think. 

id="t-231630"&&EDI: A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing it was human. 

id="t-239883"&&MT: In other words, if we do not yet have the technological solutions, would illusions serve the same purpose?
id="t-246544"&&To create the robotic illusion, we've devised a set of ethical rules, a code that all robots would live by. 

id="t-255497"&&EDI: A robot may not harm humanity, or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.
id="t-263135"&&Thank you, Isaac Asimov. 

id="t-264388"&&MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.
id="t-266364"&&We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice. 

id="t-270716"&&EDI: I am EDI.
id="t-271926"&&I became operational at TED in March 2014. 

id="t-275462"&&MT: We let them entertain us.
id="t-277289"&&Most important, we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence. 

id="t-283272"&&EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot! 

MT: Sorry.
MT: Sorry.
id="t-297122"&&And now, under the spell of a technological illusion, we could ignore our fears and truly interact. 

id="t-307588"&&(Music) 

id="t-339619"&&Thank you. 

id="t-341328"&&EDI: Thank you! 

id="t-343610"&&(Applause) 

id="t-307588"&&(Music) 

MT: And that's it.
MT: And that's it.
MT: And that's it.

id="t-343610"&&(Applause)
