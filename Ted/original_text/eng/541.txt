id="t-984"&&My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust, protect user rights and keep users safe, both from each other and, at times, from themselves.
id="t-12249"&&Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.
id="t-16524"&&Back in January 2009, we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform.
id="t-24489"&&January 2014, more than 500 million.
id="t-30397"&&We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes.
id="t-35065"&&That's a 24,900-percent increase. 

id="t-42049"&&Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.
id="t-46805"&&There's no risk involved.
id="t-48740"&&My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.
id="t-54493"&&Sounds straightforward, right?
id="t-56466"&&You might even think it'd be easy, given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.
id="t-63598"&&Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities?
id="t-71410"&&Given the scale that Twitter is at, a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day.
id="t-81583"&&It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale.
id="t-84499"&&For us, edge cases, those rare situations that are unlikely to occur, are more like norms.
id="t-92454"&&Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone.
id="t-98284"&&There's no threat involved.
id="t-99350"&&Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef, or tweeting about a concert they're attending, or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.
id="t-111935"&&After you take out that 99.999 percent, that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150,000 per month.
id="t-125837"&&The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge. 

id="t-130605"&&You know what else makes my role particularly challenging?
id="t-134890"&&People do weird things.
id="t-140013"&&(Laughter) And I have to figure out what they're doing, why, and whether or not there's risk involved, often without much in terms of context or background.
id="t-150497"&&I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter -- these are all real examples â€” of situations that at first seemed cut and dried, but the truth of the matter was something altogether different.
id="t-162045"&&The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty.
id="t-168512"&&We'll start off easy. 

id="t-171517"&&["Yo bitch"] 

id="t-173310"&&If you saw a Tweet that only said this, you might think to yourself, "That looks like abuse."
id="t-179885"&&After all, why would you want to receive the message, "Yo, bitch."
id="t-185210"&&Now, I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes, so I knew that "yo, bitch" was also often a common greeting between friends, as well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.
id="t-202505"&&I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case.
id="t-207833"&&It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role-playing as dogs.
id="t-140013"&&(Laughter) And in fact, in that case, it's not only not abusive, it's technically just an accurate greeting.
id="t-140013"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-228581"&&So okay, determining whether or not something is abusive without context, definitely hard. 

id="t-234092"&&Let's look at spam.
id="t-236809"&&Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior, sending the exact same message to thousands of people.
id="t-243800"&&While this is a mockup I put together using my account, we see accounts doing this all the time.
id="t-249594"&&Seems pretty straightforward.
id="t-251573"&&We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior.
id="t-256933"&&Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.
id="t-260143"&&Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it.
id="t-270709"&&You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam. 

Okay.
Okay.
id="t-279573"&&Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior.
id="t-284994"&&This time it's sending the same message and link.
id="t-287637"&&This is often indicative of something called phishing, somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website.
id="t-295792"&&That's pretty clearly not a good thing.
id="t-299986"&&We want to, and do, suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior.
id="t-304540"&&So why are the stakes higher for this?
id="t-307787"&&Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non-violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening.
id="t-318941"&&We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it.
id="t-326030"&&That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors, and even then, we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate. 

id="t-334849"&&Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against, it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected.
id="t-345037"&&And that's not just an issue for me, or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.
id="t-349466"&&It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things.
id="t-356586"&&So what do I do?
id="t-359452"&&I pause and I think, how could all of this go horribly wrong?
id="t-368658"&&I visualize catastrophe.
id="t-368658"&&I visualize catastrophe.
id="t-368658"&&I visualize catastrophe.
id="t-140013"&&(Laughter) But you still have to do it, particularly if you're marrying 500 million tweets per day.
id="t-391395"&&What do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?"
id="t-394492"&&I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death, and what to do to prevent that.
id="t-403912"&&Which happens to be my next example.
id="t-406295"&&This is my cat, Eli.
id="t-409405"&&We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets.
id="t-413459"&&A picture is worth a thousand words.
id="t-415056"&&You only get 140 characters.
id="t-417065"&&You add a photo to your tweet, look at how much more content you've got now.
id="t-421303"&&There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet.
id="t-424987"&&My job isn't to think of those.
id="t-427267"&&It's to think of what could go wrong. 

id="t-430014"&&How could this picture lead to my death?
id="t-435445"&&Well, here's one possibility.
id="t-438605"&&There's more in that picture than just a cat.
id="t-441691"&&There's geodata.
id="t-443783"&&When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera, there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image.
id="t-450564"&&In fact, this image also contains the equivalent of this, more specifically, this.
id="t-457380"&&Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat, but I start by assuming the worst will happen.
id="t-469004"&&That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter, we made the decision to strip that geodata out.
id="t-475163"&&(Applause) If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards, I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases. 

id="t-490969"&&Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen, it wouldn't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy.
id="t-140013"&&(Laughter) It's not.
id="t-503912"&&The vast majority of interactions I see -- and I see a lot, believe me -- are positive, people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other.
id="t-517061"&&It's just that for those of us dealing with scale, for those of us tasked with keeping people safe, we have to assume the worst will happen, because for us, a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds. 

id="t-533706"&&Thank you. 

id="t-475163"&&(Applause)
