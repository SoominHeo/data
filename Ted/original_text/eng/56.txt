id="t-1734"&&Guys, we have an issue. 

id="t-4294"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-5416"&&Growth is fading away, and it's a big deal.
id="t-9136"&&Our global economy stops growing.
id="t-12018"&&And it's not new.
id="t-13441"&&Growth has actually declined for the last 50 years.
id="t-17213"&&If we continue like this, we need to learn how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade.
id="t-24249"&&This is scary because when the economy doesn't grow, our children don't get better lives.
id="t-30535"&&What's even scarier is that when the pie does not grow, each of us get a smaller piece.
id="t-35552"&&We're then ready to fight for a bigger one.
id="t-38070"&&This creates tensions and serious conflicts.
id="t-41585"&&Growth matters a lot. 

id="t-45350"&&If we look at the history of growth, times of big growth have always been fueled by big manufacturing revolutions.
id="t-52818"&&It happened three times, every 50-60 years.
id="t-56419"&&The steam engine in the middle of the 19th century, the mass-production model in the beginning of the 20th century -- thanks, Mr. Ford.
id="t-66384"&&And the first automation wave in the 1970s. 

id="t-70157"&&Why did these manufacturing revolutions create huge growth in our economies?
id="t-75677"&&Because they have injected huge productivity improvement.
id="t-79591"&&It's rather simple: in order to grow, you need to be producing more, putting more into our economy.
id="t-87241"&&This means either more labor or more capital or more productivity.
id="t-92877"&&Each time, productivity has been the growth lever. 

id="t-97744"&&I'm here today to tell you that we are on the verge of another huge change, and that this change, surprisingly enough, is going to come from manufacturing, again.
id="t-111394"&&It will get us out of our growth slump and it will change radically the way globalization has been shaped over the last decade.
id="t-119935"&&I'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution that is currently underway. 

id="t-127213"&&It's not as if we've done nothing with manufacturing since the last revolution.
id="t-131011"&&Actually, we've made some pretty lame attempts to try to revitalize it.
id="t-135075"&&But none of them have been the big overhaul we really need to get us growing again.
id="t-140384"&&For example, we've tried to relocate our factories offshore in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor.
id="t-149048"&&Not only did this not inspire productivity, but it only saved money for a short period of time, because cheap labor didn't stay cheap for long.
id="t-158455"&&Then, we've tried to make our factories larger and we specialized them by product.
id="t-165318"&&The idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand. 

id="t-172022"&&This did help productivity for a while.
id="t-174625"&&But it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain.
id="t-179432"&&Let's take fashion retail.
id="t-181232"&&Traditional clothing companies have built offshore, global, rigid supply chains.
id="t-188787"&&When fast-fashion competitors like Zara started replenishing their stocks faster from two collections a year to one collection a month, none of them have been able to keep up with the pace.
id="t-200368"&&Most of them are in great difficulties today. 

id="t-204008"&&Yet, with all of their shortcomings, those are the factories we know today.
id="t-209539"&&When you open the doors, they look the same as they did 50 years ago.
id="t-214396"&&We've just changed the location, the size, the way they operate.
id="t-220273"&&Can you name anything else that looks the same as it did 50 years ago?
id="t-224220"&&It's crazy.
id="t-225836"&&We've made all the tweaks to the model that we could, and now we hit its limits. 

id="t-233032"&&After all of our attempts to fix the manufacturing model failed, we thought growth could come from elsewhere.
id="t-240722"&&We turned to the tech sector -- there's been quite a lot of innovations there.
id="t-245178"&&Just to name one: the Internet.
id="t-247906"&&We hoped it could produce growth.
id="t-249735"&&And indeed, it changed our lives.
id="t-252251"&&It made big waves in the media, the service, the entertainment spaces.
id="t-257081"&&But it hasn't done much for productivity.
id="t-260011"&&Actually, what's surprising is that productivity is on the decline despite all of those innovation efforts.
id="t-267523"&&Imagine that -- sitting at work, scrolling through Facebook, watching videos on YouTube has made us less productive.
id="t-275133"&&Weird. 

id="t-4294"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-277916"&&This is why we are not growing.
id="t-280580"&&We failed at reinventing the manufacturing space, and large technological innovations have played away from it.
id="t-289184"&&But what if we could combine those forces?
id="t-291927"&&What if the existing manufacturing and large technological innovation came together to create the next big manufacturing reinvention. 

id="t-301406"&&Bingo!
id="t-302688"&&This is the fourth manufacturing revolution, and it's happening right now.
id="t-307355"&&Major technologies are entering the manufacturing space, big time.
id="t-312316"&&They will boost industrial productivity by more than a third.
id="t-316217"&&This is massive, and it will do a lot in creating growth.
id="t-321286"&&Let me tell you about some of them. 

id="t-324091"&&Have you already met advanced manufacturing robots?
id="t-327583"&&They are the size of humans, they actually collaborate with them, and they can be programmed in order to perform complex, non-repetitive tasks.
id="t-337628"&&Today in our factories, only 8 percent of the tasks are automated.
id="t-342590"&&The less complex, the more repetitive ones.
id="t-346551"&&It will be 25 percent in 10 years.
id="t-349452"&&It means that by 2025, advanced robots will complement workers to be, together, 20 percent more productive, to manufacture 20 percent more outputs, to achieve 20 percent additional growth. 

id="t-363118"&&This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.
id="t-366425"&&These robots are working for us right now.
id="t-369993"&&Last year in the US, they helped Amazon prepare and ship all the products required for Cyber Monday, the annual peak of online retail.
id="t-380401"&&Last year in the US, it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history.
id="t-388626"&&Consumers spent 3 billion dollars on electronics that day.
id="t-392276"&&That's real economic growth. 

id="t-395502"&&Then there's additive manufacturing, 3D printing.
id="t-399574"&&3D printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it's now making its way through metal.
id="t-406614"&&Those are not small industries.
id="t-408875"&&Plastic and metals represent 25 percent of global manufacturing production. 

id="t-414717"&&Let's take a real example.
id="t-417005"&&In the aerospace industry, fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture, for one reason: they are made up of 20 different parts that need to be separately produced and then painstakingly assembled.
id="t-435301"&&Aerospace companies are now using 3D printing, which allows them to turn those 20 different parts into just one.
id="t-443368"&&The results?
id="t-444909"&&40 percent more productivity, 40 percent more output produced, 40 percent more growth for this specific industry. 

id="t-453283"&&But actually, the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity.
id="t-462692"&&It's about producing better, smarter products.
id="t-466287"&&It's about scale customization.
id="t-469099"&&Imagine a world where you can buy the exact products you want with the functionalities you need, with the design you want, with the same cost and lead time as a product that's been mass produced, like your car, or your clothes or your cell phone.
id="t-485113"&&The new manufacturing revolution makes it possible. 

id="t-488577"&&Advanced robots can be programmed in order to perform any product configuration without any setup time or ramp up.
id="t-497791"&&3D printers instantaneously produce any customized design.
id="t-503675"&&We are now able to produce a batch of one product, your product, at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many.
id="t-513629"&&Those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play. 

id="t-518468"&&Not only will manufacturing become more productive, it will also become more flexible, and those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing.
id="t-531106"&&But actually, there are even some bigger implications for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back into the limelight.
id="t-540441"&&It will create a huge macroeconomic shift. 

id="t-544683"&&First, our factories will be relocated into our home markets.
id="t-549877"&&In the world of scale customization, consumer proximity is the new norm. 

id="t-555722"&&Then, our factories will be smaller, agile.
id="t-559918"&&Scale does not matter anymore, flexibility does.
id="t-563802"&&They will be operating on a multi-product, made-to-order basis.
id="t-567859"&&The change will be drastic. 

id="t-570590"&&Globalization will enter a new era.
id="t-575145"&&The East-to-West trade flows will be replaced by regional trade flows.
id="t-580789"&&East for East, West for West.
id="t-583687"&&When you think about that, the old model was pretty much insane.
id="t-589065"&&Piling up stocks, making products travel the whole world before they reach their end consumers.
id="t-594743"&&The new model, producing just next to the consumer market, will be much cleaner, much better for our environment.
id="t-604678"&&In mature economies, manufacturing will be back home, creating more employment, more productivity and more growth.
id="t-613930"&&Good news, isn't it? 

id="t-616541"&&But here's the thing with growth -- it does not come automatically.
id="t-620328"&&Mature economies will have to seize it.
id="t-623196"&&We'll have to massively re-train our workforce.
id="t-626547"&&In most countries, like in my country, France, we've told our children that manufacturing had no future.
id="t-632357"&&That it was something happening far away.
id="t-634358"&&We need to reverse that and teach manufacturing again at university.
id="t-639203"&&Only the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth. 

id="t-646640"&&It's also a chance for developing economies.
id="t-650461"&&Of course China and other emerging economies won't be the factory of the world anymore.
id="t-657545"&&Actually, it was not a sustainable model in the long term, as those countries are becoming richer.
id="t-665779"&&Last year, it was already as expensive to produce in Brazil as to produce in France.
id="t-674184"&&By 2018, manufacturing costs in China will be on par with the US. 

id="t-681350"&&The new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition of those emerging economies towards a model driven by domestic consumption.
id="t-691675"&&And this is good, because this is where growth will be created.
id="t-695915"&&In the next five years, the next billion consumers in China will inject more growth in our economies than the top five European markets together. 

id="t-707944"&&This fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us.
id="t-713046"&&If we play it right, we'll see sustainable growth in all of our economies.
id="t-718969"&&This means more wealth distributed to all of us and a better future for our children. 

id="t-725189"&&Thank you. 

id="t-726374"&&(Applause)
