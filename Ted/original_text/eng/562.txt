id="t-903"&&Thirteen years ago, we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.
id="t-9450"&&After some success, we've hit a big hurdle.
id="t-15123"&&The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments, which have fallen for two consecutive years.
id="t-25133"&&My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions.
id="t-39719"&&Can we simply print money for aid? 

id="t-46629"&&"Surely not."
id="t-48136"&&It's a common reaction.
id="t-50145"&&(Laughter) It's a quick talk.
id="t-53677"&&Others channel John McEnroe.
id="t-58454"&&"You cannot be serious!"

id="t-60426"&&Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious, thanks to these two children, who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart of my talk.
id="t-75529"&&On the left, we have Pia.
id="t-78495"&&She lives in England.
id="t-80085"&&She has two loving parents, one of whom is standing right here.
id="t-88129"&&Dorothy, on the right, lives in rural Kenya.
id="t-93420"&&She's one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support.
id="t-102912"&&I do that because I believe that Dorothy, like Pia, deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her.
id="t-113915"&&You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.
id="t-116954"&&The U.N. agrees too.
id="t-119564"&&Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all. 

id="t-129834"&&But -- and here's that hurdle -- can we afford our aid aspirations?
id="t-138904"&&History suggests not.
id="t-142197"&&In 1970, governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to 0.7 percent of their national income.
id="t-153922"&&As you can see, a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target.
id="t-162793"&&But then come the Millennium Development Goals, eight ambitious targets to be met by 2015.
id="t-173373"&&If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty, you get a sense of the ambition.
id="t-183369"&&There's also been some success.
id="t-186974"&&The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has halved.
id="t-194259"&&But a lot remains to be done in two years.
id="t-197986"&&One in eight remain hungry.
id="t-201677"&&In the context of this auditorium, the front two rows aren't going to get any food.
id="t-208736"&&We can't settle for that, which is why the concern about the eighth goal, which relates to funding, which I said at the beginning is falling, is so troubling. 

id="t-224592"&&So what can be done?
id="t-226646"&&Well, I work in financial markets, not development.
id="t-232089"&&I study the behavior of investors, how they react to policy and the economy.
id="t-240712"&&It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.
id="t-245345"&&But it took an innocent question from my then-four-year-old daughter to make me appreciate that. 

id="t-254560"&&Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity.
id="t-262171"&&I didn't have any change to give him, and she was disappointed.
id="t-266223"&&Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling.
id="t-271743"&&After a little while, I ask her what she's doing, and she shows me a drawing of a Â£5 note to give to the man outside.
id="t-282558"&&It's so sweet, and more generous than Dad would have been.
id="t-286911"&&But of course I explained to her, "You can't do that; it's not allowed."
id="t-291340"&&To which I get the classic four-year-old response: "Why not?"
id="t-298582"&&Now I'm excited, because I actually think I can answer this time.
id="t-302837"&&So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon. 

id="t-319036"&&Something about that exchange stuck with me, not because of the look of relief on Pia's face when I finally finished, but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply, a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis.
id="t-347109"&&To reassure investors, central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same.
id="t-359609"&&They funded these purchases with money they created themselves.
id="t-366756"&&The money wasn't actually physically printed.
id="t-370042"&&It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today.
id="t-373656"&&But the amount created was unprecedented.
id="t-378857"&&Together, the central banks of the U.S., U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars.
id="t-391650"&&That's three times, in fact that's more than three times, the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.
id="t-399917"&&Three times! 

id="t-404165"&&Before the crisis, this would have been utterly unthinkable, yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.
id="t-418487"&&The price of gold, an asset thought to protect against inflation, did jump, but investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation.
id="t-431517"&&They bought fixed income securities, bonds.
id="t-435061"&&They bought equities too.
id="t-437828"&&For all the scare stories, the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence. 

id="t-450041"&&That confidence was based on two pillars.
id="t-455716"&&The first was that, after years of keeping inflation under control, central banks were trusted to take the money-printing away if inflation became a threat.
id="t-471152"&&Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.
id="t-477381"&&As you can see, in the United States, inflation for most of this period remained below average.
id="t-484747"&&It was the same elsewhere. 

id="t-488019"&&So how does all this relate to aid?
id="t-491436"&&Well, this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in.
id="t-500335"&&I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year, and I was inspired to give a one-off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make.
id="t-516241"&&So think of this: Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years, I was able to double my contribution.
id="t-530544"&&Brilliant. 

id="t-532957"&&So following that conversation with my daughter, and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing, and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time, this made me wonder: Could we match but just on a much grander scale?
id="t-562009"&&Let's call this scheme "Print Aid."
id="t-566462"&&And here's how it might work.
id="t-569120"&&Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so, the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit.
id="t-582447"&&Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7 percent for years, so let's set the limit at half of that, 0.35 percent of their income.
id="t-593232"&&So it would work like this: If in a given year the government gave 0.2 percent of its income to overseas aid, the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2 percent.
id="t-603781"&&So far so good. 

id="t-607382"&&How risky is this?
id="t-610062"&&Well, this involves the creation of money to buy goods, not assets.
id="t-617112"&&It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.
id="t-620665"&&But there are two important mitigating factors here.
id="t-625093"&&The first is that by definition, this money printed would be spent overseas.
id="t-633786"&&So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country.
id="t-646670"&&That is unlikely for the second reason: the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme.
id="t-655664"&&So let's think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
id="t-666689"&&To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years, Print Aid would have generated 200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.
id="t-678290"&&What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system?
id="t-688436"&&Are you read for this?
id="t-691593"&&You might struggle to see that at the back, because the gap is quite small.
id="t-697247"&&So what we're saying here is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble to save our financial systems, and you know what, it paid off.
id="t-707594"&&There was no inflation.
id="t-710167"&&Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra 200 billion for aid?
id="t-718125"&&Would the risks really be that different?
id="t-720034"&&To me, it's not that clear.
id="t-722577"&&What is clear is the impact on aid.
id="t-725935"&&Even though this is the printing of just three central banks, the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost 40 percent.
id="t-738429"&&Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.
id="t-744310"&&Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.
id="t-747297"&&Governments are still incentivized to give.
id="t-750042"&&But you know what, that's the point of a matching scheme. 

id="t-754535"&&So I think what we've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest, but the benefits are potentially huge.
id="t-770991"&&Imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding.
id="t-774294"&&We might be able to feed the front row. 

id="t-779265"&&The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear, apart from the fact that I've run out of time, is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one.
id="t-791237"&&Today, money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool.
id="t-797976"&&That may not always be the case.
id="t-800457"&&Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid.
id="t-797976"&&That may not always be the case.
id="t-810331"&&Today might be the only time that these two things coincide, such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give. 

id="t-823470"&&So, can we print money for international aid?
id="t-831900"&&I seriously believe the question should be, why not? 

id="t-837701"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-840514"&&(Applause)
