id="t-52744"&&Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old.
id="t-60056"&&At that age, I also learned about what an animator was.
id="t-63250"&&There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about.
id="t-67345"&&When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, "That's what I want to be."
id="t-74714"&&I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud, but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. 

id="t-80900"&&Animation and art has always been my first love.
id="t-85227"&&It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for "Malicious Dishes."
id="t-89216"&&There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?
id="t-97418"&&Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things?
id="t-101130"&&And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born. 

id="t-104502"&&At four years old, my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again.
id="t-109513"&&That started my love for technology.
id="t-112123"&&I built my first website myself in HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. 

id="t-117671"&&I'm also working on an animated series called "The Pollinators."
id="t-120665"&&It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important.
id="t-125250"&&If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators, then all creatures, including ourselves, that depend on these plants, would starve.
id="t-132285"&&So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team.
id="t-45518"&&(Applause) (Foot stomp) (Music) (Roar) Pollinator: Deforestsaurus!
id="t-45518"&&(Applause) (Foot stomp) (Music) (Roar) Pollinator: Deforestsaurus!
id="t-160631"&&I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
id="t-149376"&&(Music) 

Thank you.
id="t-45518"&&(Applause) 

id="t-177524"&&All of my animations start with ideas, but what are ideas?
id="t-184337"&&Ideas can spark a movement.
id="t-187340"&&Ideas are opportunities and innovation.
id="t-191009"&&Ideas truly are what make the world go round.
id="t-194628"&&If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now with technology, medicine, art, culture, and how we even live our lives.
id="t-203125"&&At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas, and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
id="t-211107"&&(Laughter) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
id="t-216304"&&I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then.
id="t-223696"&&I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
id="t-229006"&&I would find different fabrics around the house, and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot; and I had all these ideas for designs.
id="t-236374"&&I noticed when I wore my creations, people would stop me and say, "Wow, that's really cute.
id="t-236374"&&I noticed when I wore my creations, people would stop me and say, "Wow, that's really cute.
id="t-241732"&&And I thought, I can start my own business. 

id="t-244915"&&Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old.
id="t-248557"&&I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back.
id="t-253877"&&My mom taught me how to sew, and on my back porch, I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon, and I would write down the names and the price of each item.
id="t-261818"&&I started making more items like hats, scarves and bags.
id="t-266094"&&Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more. 

id="t-273925"&&Now, I had a lot to learn about my business, like branding and marketing, staying engaged with my customers, and seeing what sold the most and the least.
id="t-283423"&&Soon, my business really started to take off.
id="t-285837"&&Then one day, Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old.
id="t-211107"&&(Laughter) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article. 

id="t-296036"&&Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly?
id="t-300543"&&I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little.
id="t-305108"&&My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment.
id="t-310319"&&I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet, so I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed, there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment.
id="t-326004"&&For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials.
id="t-330718"&&These actions can pollute the air, making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
id="t-336181"&&So when I started my business, I knew two things: All of my items had to be eco-friendly, and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations.
id="t-45518"&&(Applause) I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future.
id="t-360174"&&I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. 

id="t-367581"&&We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it.
id="t-372636"&&But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world.
id="t-377196"&&It takes to get it through your hearts, because when you get it through your heart, that is when movements are sparked.
id="t-383275"&&That is when opportunities and innovation are created, and that is why ideas come to life. 

id="t-389279"&&Thank you, and peace and blessings. 

id="t-45518"&&(Applause) 

Thank you.
id="t-45518"&&(Applause)
