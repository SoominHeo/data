id="t-577"&&Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.
id="t-2074"&&I've always had stage fright, and not just a little bit, it's a big bit.
id="t-7186"&&And it didn't even matter until I was 27.
id="t-9979"&&That's when I started writing songs, and even then I only played them for myself.
id="t-14339"&&Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable. 

id="t-18084"&&But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn't enough.
id="t-20891"&&I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people, but physiologically, I couldn't do it.
id="t-27216"&&I had this irrational fear.
id="t-30142"&&But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform. 

id="t-33491"&&So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me.
id="t-40216"&&Well, when I got there, it was packed.
id="t-43073"&&There were like 20 people there.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) And they all looked angry.
id="t-49537"&&But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play, and I felt pretty good. 

id="t-54630"&&Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me.
id="t-63155"&&Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.
id="t-66710"&&So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster.
id="t-66710"&&So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore.
id="t-83142"&&Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles, basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) That condition is not conducive to performing folk music.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) I have never been more terrified -- until now.
id="t-114173"&&(Laughter and cheers) 

id="t-123248"&&So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out.
id="t-135930"&&And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has, this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.
id="t-141237"&&I mean, it's a nightmare.
id="t-142888"&&I'm embarrassed, the audience is clearly uncomfortable, they're focused on my discomfort.
id="t-147709"&&It was so bad.
id="t-151484"&&But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter. 

id="t-155421"&&And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.
id="t-155421"&&And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.
id="t-155421"&&And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.

id="t-164927"&&That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
id="t-164927"&&That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
id="t-164927"&&That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
id="t-164927"&&That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) I couldn't shake it. 

id="t-182848"&&And that's when I had an epiphany.
id="t-182848"&&And that's when I had an epiphany.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness.
id="t-194161"&&That only seems authentic when I have stage fright, and the more nervous I was, the better the song would be.
id="t-194161"&&That only seems authentic when I have stage fright, and the more nervous I was, the better the song would be.
id="t-200160"&&So I started writing a song about having stage fright.
id="t-204989"&&First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel.
id="t-210307"&&And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous.
id="t-217961"&&By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it.
id="t-224383"&&They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-234111"&&By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that was essential for my success.
id="t-245792"&&And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance.
id="t-250630"&&And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease.
id="t-255428"&&And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all.
id="t-255428"&&And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all.
id="t-45047"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-268945"&&Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you?
id="t-271670"&&(Applause) 

id="t-280753"&&Can I have a sip of water?
id="t-283715"&&(Music) Thank you.
