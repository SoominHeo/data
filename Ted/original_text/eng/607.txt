id="t-1015"&&So when I do my job, people hate me.
id="t-4686"&&In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me.
id="t-8970"&&And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker.
id="t-12765"&&I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.
id="t-336276"&&(Applause) So y'all heard that, right?
id="t-336276"&&(Applause) So y'all heard that, right?
id="t-21450"&&I am a gay talking head on Fox News.
id="t-24755"&&I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned. 

id="t-28762"&&So I go on television.
id="t-30369"&&I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in, in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.
id="t-38742"&&It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions.
id="t-47060"&&It's totally almost just like that. 

id="t-49980"&&And that's just on air.
id="t-51252"&&The hate mail I get is unbelievable.
id="t-53439"&&Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count.
id="t-61567"&&I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt, and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.
id="t-69337"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-72163"&&So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?
id="t-77580"&&Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness. 

id="t-87810"&&Let me give you a small example.
id="t-87810"&&Let me give you a small example.
id="t-87810"&&Let me give you a small example.
id="t-92560"&&I care about two things.
id="t-93942"&&One, I care that you spell it right.
id="t-69337"&&(Laughter) (Applause) Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. You'd totally be surprised.
id="t-108088"&&And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
id="t-108088"&&And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
id="t-108088"&&And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
id="t-113790"&&Or do you really want to hurt me personally?
id="t-117805"&&Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another.
id="t-127608"&&And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
id="t-134351"&&Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. 

id="t-138450"&&So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging.
id="t-147644"&&That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.
id="t-152308"&&But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us.
id="t-161195"&&In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong.
id="t-166838"&&And incidentally, that means that people don't like us.
id="t-166838"&&And incidentally, that means that people don't like us.

id="t-172976"&&Now here's the kicker.
id="t-174931"&&Conservatives are really nice.
id="t-177024"&&I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised.
id="t-182481"&&Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.
id="t-186743"&&He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help.
id="t-195872"&&Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive, and that's why people listen to him.
id="t-206356"&&Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. 

id="t-211672"&&We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements, and if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground.
id="t-225048"&&It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful. 

id="t-233321"&&So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known.
id="t-241536"&&Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame.
id="t-251634"&&Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us.
id="t-258587"&&That is emotional correctness. 

id="t-261665"&&I'm not saying it's easy.
id="t-263481"&&An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities.
id="t-273083"&&This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama.
id="t-284428"&&I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic, because I don't just get hate mail.
id="t-292616"&&I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.
id="t-295912"&&And one of my all-time favorites begins, "I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic, but I'm a big fan of you as a person."
id="t-310420"&&Now this guy doesn't agree with me, yet.
id="t-69337"&&(Laughter) But he's listening, not because of what I said, but because of how I said it, and somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.
id="t-326884"&&That's emotional correctness, and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change. 

id="t-333803"&&Thank you. 

id="t-336276"&&(Applause)
