id="t-968"&&So this is my niece.
id="t-2644"&&Her name is Yahli.
id="t-4203"&&She is nine months old.
id="t-6201"&&Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer.
id="t-9269"&&By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different. 

id="t-15347"&&In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work.
id="t-20766"&&They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines.
id="t-28388"&&Machine learning is the technology that's responsible for most of this disruption.
id="t-32619"&&It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence.
id="t-35433"&&It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do.
id="t-39955"&&My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning.
id="t-43394"&&We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia.
id="t-49279"&&This gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do, what they can't do and what jobs they might automate or threaten. 

id="t-57316"&&Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s.
id="t-60890"&&It started with relatively simple tasks.
id="t-63406"&&It started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes.
id="t-72036"&&Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs.
id="t-75586"&&Machine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks.
id="t-79860"&&In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.
id="t-86328"&&The winning algorithms were able to match the grades given by human teachers.
id="t-91092"&&Last year, we issued an even more difficult challenge.
id="t-94100"&&Can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy?
id="t-99164"&&Again, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists. 

id="t-105561"&&Now, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this.
id="t-109986"&&A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career.
id="t-114407"&&An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.
id="t-116791"&&A machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes.
id="t-122456"&&We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks. 

id="t-128665"&&But there are things we can do that machines can't do.
id="t-132791"&&Where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations.
id="t-136893"&&They can't handle things they haven't seen many times before.
id="t-141321"&&The fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data.
id="t-147347"&&Now, humans don't.
id="t-149125"&&We have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we've never seen before. 

id="t-154808"&&Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar.
id="t-162970"&&He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses?
id="t-162970"&&He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses?

id="t-171444"&&Now, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity.
id="t-174541"&&But this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day.
id="t-180501"&&Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations, and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate. 

id="t-190041"&&So what does this mean for the future of work?
id="t-192804"&&The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question: To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?
id="t-205975"&&On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.
id="t-205975"&&On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.
id="t-205975"&&On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.
id="t-212772"&&Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts.
id="t-218944"&&Accountants and lawyers are still needed.
id="t-220965"&&They're going to be needed for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation.
id="t-225052"&&But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. 

id="t-228689"&&Now, as mentioned, machines are not making progress on novel situations.
id="t-232837"&&The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention.
id="t-236318"&&It has to stand out from the crowd.
id="t-238057"&&Business strategy means finding gaps in the market, things that nobody else is doing.
id="t-242305"&&It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy. 

id="t-249988"&&So Yahli, whatever you decide to do, let every day bring you a new challenge.
id="t-255587"&&If it does, then you will stay ahead of the machines. 

id="t-259126"&&Thank you. 

id="t-260326"&&(Applause)
