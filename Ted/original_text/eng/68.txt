id="t-872"&&This is a man-made forest.
id="t-3880"&&It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space -- as small as your house garden.
id="t-15327"&&Each of these forests is just two years old.
id="t-19298"&&I have a forest in the backyard of my own house.
id="t-23036"&&It attracts a lot of biodiversity. 

id="t-25582"&&(Bird call) 

id="t-30229"&&I wake up to this every morning, like a Disney princess. 

id="t-33321"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-35164"&&I am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of these forests professionally.
id="t-40798"&&We have helped factories, farms, schools, homes, resorts, apartment buildings, public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests.
id="t-58715"&&A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
id="t-64035"&&A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
id="t-70212"&&A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
id="t-75540"&&It doesn't matter how big or small they are. 

id="t-79046"&&Most of the world we live in today was forest.
id="t-82453"&&This was before human intervention.
id="t-84865"&&Then we built up our cities on those forests, like SÃ£o Paulo, forgetting that we belong to nature as well, as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.
id="t-96215"&&Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat.
id="t-100190"&&But not anymore for some of us.
id="t-102647"&&A few others and I today make these forests professionally -- anywhere and everywhere. 

id="t-109368"&&I'm an industrial engineer.
id="t-111258"&&I specialize in making cars.
id="t-114078"&&In my previous job at Toyota, I learned how to convert natural resources into products.
id="t-121125"&&To give you an example, we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree, convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it -- the product.
id="t-129418"&&But these products can never become a natural resource again.
id="t-133272"&&We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state.
id="t-139529"&&That's industrial production. 

id="t-142025"&&Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
id="t-145910"&&The natural system produces by bringing elements together, atom by atom.
id="t-152336"&&All the natural products become a natural resource again.
id="t-158343"&&This is something which I learned when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.
id="t-164371"&&And this was the first time I worked with nature, rather than against it.
id="t-169894"&&Since then, we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
id="t-177678"&&Every time we work at a new place, we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us.
id="t-186666"&&All we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over. 

id="t-193100"&&To make a forest we start with soil.
id="t-196125"&&We touch, feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks.
id="t-201680"&&If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact -- so compact, that water cannot seep in.
id="t-208188"&&We mix some local biomass available around, which can help soil become more porous.
id="t-217040"&&Water can now seep in.
id="t-219359"&&If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water, we will mix some more biomass -- some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse, so soil can hold this water and it stays moist. 

id="t-233680"&&To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.
id="t-239047"&&What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
id="t-242383"&&We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
id="t-244733"&&That would be the industrial way.
id="t-246369"&&It goes against nature.
id="t-247819"&&We instead add microorganisms to the soil.
id="t-250927"&&They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.
id="t-254886"&&They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil, so all they have to do is eat and multiply.
id="t-260222"&&And as their number grows, the soil starts breathing again.
id="t-263769"&&It becomes alive. 

id="t-266215"&&We survey the native tree species of the place.
id="t-268866"&&How do we decide what's native or not?
id="t-271473"&&Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native.
id="t-275955"&&That's the simple rule.
id="t-277949"&&We survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest.
id="t-286689"&&We survey the sacred groves, or sacred forests around old temples.
id="t-292973"&&And if we don't find anything at all, we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
id="t-302547"&&We research old paintings, poems and literature from the place, to identify the tree species belonging there. 

id="t-311217"&&Once we know our trees, we divide them in four different layers: shrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.
id="t-318475"&&We fix the ratios of each layer, and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.
id="t-326506"&&If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
id="t-331446"&&It could be a flowering forest, a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees, or it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest. 

id="t-343560"&&We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.
id="t-347011"&&We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other, or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.
id="t-355224"&&We plant the saplings close to each other.
id="t-358548"&&On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch, so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.
id="t-364605"&&When it's cold, frost formation happens only on the mulch, so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.
id="t-373497"&&The soil is very soft -- so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily, rapidly. 

id="t-382064"&&Initially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing, but it's growing under the surface.
id="t-386746"&&In the first three months, roots reach a depth of one meter.
id="t-390736"&&These roots form a mesh, tightly holding the soil.
id="t-394397"&&Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.
id="t-398706"&&So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree, these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
id="t-405754"&&Whenever it rains, magically, mushrooms appear overnight.
id="t-410573"&&And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network. 

id="t-414663"&&Once these roots are established, forest starts growing on the surface.
id="t-419835"&&As the forest grows we keep watering it -- for the next two to three years, we water the forest.
id="t-428752"&&We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees, so we remove the weeds growing on the ground.
id="t-436971"&&As this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.
id="t-440801"&&Eventually, the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
id="t-445902"&&Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well. 

id="t-450044"&&At this stage, every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.
id="t-457327"&&This dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture.
id="t-462712"&&We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.
id="t-467340"&&And even without watering, the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.
id="t-473970"&&Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor, it immediately starts decaying.
id="t-480317"&&This decayed biomass forms humus, which is food for the forest.
id="t-485530"&&As the forest grows, more leaves fall on the surface -- it means more humus is produced, it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
id="t-494245"&&And this forest keeps growing exponentially. 

id="t-498053"&&Once established, these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again -- probably forever.
id="t-506209"&&In a natural forest like this, no management is the best management.
id="t-512493"&&It's a tiny jungle party. 

id="t-33321"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-516663"&&This forest grows as a collective.
id="t-519627"&&If the same trees -- same species -- would have been planted independently, it wouldn't grow so fast.
id="t-526503"&&And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years. 

id="t-532044"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-533222"&&(Applause)
