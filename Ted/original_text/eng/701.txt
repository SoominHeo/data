id="t-928"&&Everything is interconnected.
id="t-4012"&&As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
id="t-7538"&&We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. 

id="t-15910"&&When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
id="t-23728"&&There were no clouds in the sky.
id="t-27282"&&And after a while I began to perspire.
id="t-30453"&&And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that?
id="t-36827"&&That's part of you up there.
id="t-38946"&&That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals."

id="t-49920"&&In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."

id="t-63897"&&And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do.
id="t-90118"&&These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.
id="t-99328"&&They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. 

id="t-106826"&&Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.
id="t-109728"&&There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
id="t-120697"&&And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.
id="t-129284"&&I've learned to respect the lightning.
id="t-132562"&&My hair used to be straight. 

id="t-134696"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-136120"&&I'm just kidding. 

id="t-134696"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-139886"&&What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
id="t-151297"&&They become lovely monsters. 

id="t-154029"&&When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.
id="t-160295"&&As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. 

All my relations.
All my relations.
