id="t-1267"&&Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.
id="t-5795"&&You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights.
id="t-13058"&&Some battle oppressive governments.
id="t-16219"&&Others battle oppressive societies.
id="t-20955"&&Which battle do you think is harder?
id="t-24811"&&Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes. 

id="t-30363"&&Let me take you back two years ago in my life.
id="t-36179"&&It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.
id="t-39135"&&He was five at the time.
id="t-41819"&&After finishing his bedtime rituals, he looked at me and he asked a question: "Mommy, are we bad people?"

id="t-51572"&&I was shocked.
id="t-54032"&&"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"

id="t-57189"&&Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school.
id="t-62107"&&He wouldn't tell me what happened.
id="t-64073"&&[But now] he was ready to tell. 

id="t-68136"&&"Two boys hit me today in school.
id="t-70947"&&They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.
id="t-74316"&&You and your mom should be put in jail.'"

id="t-79102"&&I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.
id="t-82243"&&I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.
id="t-86947"&&But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth, when it all came together.
id="t-95740"&&You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars.
id="t-107248"&&Just for giving me his car keys, my own brother was detained twice, and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
id="t-120430"&&My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers, some of them our friends and family of my own father.
id="t-134816"&&I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings, in the streets and in schools.
id="t-146984"&&It all hit me.
id="t-149328"&&It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son.
id="t-153816"&&They were just influenced by the adults around them.
id="t-157886"&&And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.
id="t-165169"&&It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules. 

id="t-171715"&&But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.
id="t-176252"&&Allow me to give you a briefing about my story.
id="t-182240"&&It was May, 2011, and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home, although I have a car and an international driver's license.
id="t-193341"&&As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban, but it's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it, a whole generation ago. 

id="t-204600"&&He broke the good/bad news in my face.
id="t-206736"&&"But there is no law banning you from driving."

id="t-209893"&&I looked it up, and he was right.
id="t-212097"&&There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.
id="t-214776"&&It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women.
id="t-222936"&&That realization ignited the idea of June 17, where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive.
id="t-231193"&&It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these "Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."
id="t-238254"&&A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah, she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video.
id="t-246863"&&We needed proof. 

So I drove.
So I drove.
id="t-251584"&&And to my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
id="t-256384"&&What happened next, of course?
id="t-258090"&&I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign. 

id="t-264546"&&The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.
id="t-268158"&&That really creeped us out.
id="t-270338"&&I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists.
id="t-274418"&&We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day, June 17, when women go out and drive.
id="t-282219"&&So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car.
id="t-282219"&&So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car.
id="t-282219"&&So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car.
id="t-292806"&&Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day, and I was sent to jail.
id="t-298281"&&I wasn't sure why I was sent there, because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
id="t-303083"&&But what I was sure of was my innocence.
id="t-305370"&&I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today."
id="t-319591"&&Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy, some attacking me badly, and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.
id="t-333319"&&I was released after nine days. 

id="t-335103"&&June 17 comes.
id="t-337789"&&The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars, but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day.
id="t-337789"&&The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars, but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day.
id="t-337789"&&The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars, but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day.

id="t-350063"&&(Applause) 

id="t-360407"&&So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive, or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia, but maybe few know why.
id="t-368282"&&Allow me to help you answer this question. 

id="t-370866"&&There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council -- it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia — and it was done by a local professor, a university professor.
id="t-383652"&&He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.
id="t-388015"&&And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. 

id="t-404849"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-406186"&&I know, I was like this, I was shocked.
id="t-407689"&&I was like, "We are the last country in the world where women don't drive."
id="t-412762"&&So if you look at the map of the world, that only leaves two countries: Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world. 

id="t-421007"&&We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study, and it made headlines around the world. 

id="t-426563"&&[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns] 

id="t-404849"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-429592"&&And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor.
id="t-433727"&&It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear. 

id="t-438226"&&This system is based on ultra-conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them, so they need to take permission from this guardian, whether verbal or written, all their lives.
id="t-453851"&&We are minors until the day we die.
id="t-456307"&&And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law, or the religious laws.
id="t-465105"&&What's worst, when they become codified as laws in the system, and when women themselves believe in their inferiority, and they even fight those who try to question these rules. 

id="t-479137"&&So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.
id="t-483403"&&It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality, of my person -- the villain back in my home country, and the hero outside. 

id="t-493912"&&Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.
id="t-497987"&&One of them is when I was in jail.
id="t-500365"&&I'm pretty sure when I was in jail, everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail. 

id="t-510519"&&But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.
id="t-513996"&&It was more like this: "Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive."

id="t-522439"&&I know. 

id="t-525473"&&"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."

Ah, it's okay.
Ah, it's okay.

id="t-530089"&&"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses: 'Foreign forces incited me.'"

id="t-404849"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-536657"&&And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.
id="t-541854"&&So it's a totally different picture. 

id="t-545282"&&I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum.
id="t-549666"&&I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me, and they looked at me as an inspiration.
id="t-556571"&&At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much.
id="t-561358"&&The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people, and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
id="t-568850"&&Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag, while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero, there was like a handful of tweets written.
id="t-576721"&&They even started a poll.
id="t-578661"&&More than 13,000 voters answered this poll: whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.
id="t-584970"&&Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
id="t-587996"&&So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality. 

id="t-593493"&&For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman, and I do love my country, and because I love my country, I'm doing this.
id="t-600045"&&Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) 

id="t-615382"&&Thank you. 

id="t-639615"&&But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
id="t-643836"&&I learned to be always there.
id="t-646054"&&The first thing, I got out of jail, of course after I took a shower, I went online, I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page, and I've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me.
id="t-658626"&&I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only.
id="t-658626"&&I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only.
id="t-658626"&&I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only.
id="t-672967"&&There are a lot of people also -- very big support, like those 3,000 people who signed the petition to release me.
id="t-679611"&&We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women, and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition.
id="t-690889"&&There were people like that, I just showed some examples, who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia, and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. 

id="t-703408"&&Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights.
id="t-707994"&&The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
id="t-707994"&&The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) The same time, finally, that Council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial, the spokesperson of the traffic police said, we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.
id="t-745217"&&The Grand Mufti, who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
id="t-753543"&&It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti. 

id="t-758073"&&So for me, it's not about only these small steps.
id="t-763622"&&It's about women themselves. 

id="t-765187"&&A friend once asked me, she said, "So when do you think this women driving will happen?"

id="t-769590"&&I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'
id="t-772339"&&and take action to make it now."

id="t-775113"&&So it's not only about the system, it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say. 

id="t-783210"&&So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.
id="t-789362"&&And I don't know how I became one now.
id="t-793329"&&But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future when someone asks me my story, I will say, "I'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban, fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."

id="t-808608"&&So the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face, oppressive governments or oppressive societies?
id="t-818062"&&I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. 

id="t-820961"&&Thank you, everyone. 

id="t-350063"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause) Thank you.
id="t-350063"&&(Applause)
