id="t-607"&&So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
id="t-6975"&&When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid.
id="t-14175"&&But my tiger mother said, "No."
id="t-16823"&&My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them.
id="t-21063"&&After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job.
id="t-29892"&&It is not important if I like the job or not. 

id="t-32687"&&But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
id="t-37967"&&That is me playing my imaginary piano.
id="t-41615"&&An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
id="t-48327"&&I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show.
id="t-53355"&&But no adults liked the idea.
id="t-57161"&&No adults believed I was serious.
id="t-59884"&&Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was.
id="t-65884"&&So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
id="t-71649"&&My dream would never come true.
id="t-74616"&&I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. 

id="t-82498"&&But that's so unfair.
id="t-84926"&&So I was determined to find another calling.
id="t-84926"&&So I was determined to find another calling.
id="t-84926"&&So I was determined to find another calling.
id="t-91465"&&I turned to books. 

id="t-93697"&&I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.
id="t-93697"&&I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.

id="t-102216"&&I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.
id="t-102216"&&I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.

And I learned to be efficient from this book.
And I learned to be efficient from this book.

id="t-112830"&&And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. 

id="t-116795"&&["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] 

id="t-118866"&&I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first?
id="t-124938"&&Books banned in China, of course.
id="t-128463"&&"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
id="t-128463"&&"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
id="t-128463"&&"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
id="t-136235"&&The Bible is interesting, but strange.
id="t-139960"&&(Laughter) That's a topic for a different day.
id="t-145916"&&But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother."
id="t-145916"&&But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother."
id="t-145916"&&But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother."
id="t-156879"&&So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. 

id="t-165771"&&Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading.
id="t-170565"&&It offers many insights.
id="t-172420"&&For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
id="t-182085"&&It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
id="t-186721"&&A map actually carries somebody's view.
id="t-190974"&&Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
id="t-193382"&&It's a standard practice in the academic world.
id="t-196686"&&There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. 

id="t-202099"&&Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic.
id="t-207340"&&So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
id="t-212929"&&So I started reading books in pairs.
id="t-216304"&&So they can be about people -- ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences.
id="t-223588"&&["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.

id="t-243342"&&For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual.
id="t-249119"&&For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 

id="t-260763"&&So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
id="t-265699"&&["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
id="t-270527"&&For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy."
id="t-270527"&&For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy."

id="t-139960"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-289258"&&Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present.
id="t-297290"&&I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
id="t-301525"&&Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered.
id="t-307138"&&I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream.
id="t-313146"&&Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
id="t-322066"&&Even a shattered dream can do that for you. 

id="t-326288"&&So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time.
id="t-333952"&&So may books be always with you. 

id="t-337513"&&Thank you. 

id="t-338991"&&(Applause) 

id="t-337513"&&Thank you.
id="t-338991"&&(Applause) 

id="t-337513"&&Thank you.
