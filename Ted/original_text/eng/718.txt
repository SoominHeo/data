id="t-161834"&&Hi, everybody. 

id="t-164525"&&Ban-gap-seum-ni-da. 

id="t-166644"&&I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. 

id="t-171590"&&I might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair.
id="t-181828"&&The violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me.
id="t-187510"&&Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise.
id="t-195161"&&When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music. 

id="t-8438"&&(Music) 

id="t-287924"&&In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.
id="t-296266"&&The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. 

id="t-314807"&&Do you feel like you are all alone?
id="t-317946"&&I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me.

id="t-153724"&&(Applause) 

id="t-158719"&&Thank you. 

id="t-410503"&&Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries.
id="t-417119"&&My audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music.
id="t-424926"&&I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few. 

id="t-441687"&&Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you.
id="t-452782"&&Let me introduce you to my brand new project, "Baroque in Rock," which became a golden disc most recently.
id="t-461407"&&It's such an honor for me. 

id="t-463904"&&I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.
id="t-472778"&&But it's now your turn.
id="t-476345"&&Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.
id="t-481764"&&Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world.
id="t-486581"&&I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters.
id="t-492351"&&Play your life, and stay tuned.
