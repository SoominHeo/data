id="t-1615"&&So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor.
id="t-6286"&&My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.
id="t-10403"&&Everyone knew who I was, so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected, and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
id="t-23571"&&She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office, so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class, for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.
id="t-33163"&&Man, her office was packed. 

id="t-36954"&&So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.
id="t-45226"&&But that doesn't mean that we can't.
id="t-47556"&&It just takes a little bit more.
id="t-49743"&&Like, I remember one day I found my dad convulsing, foaming at the mouth, OD-ing on the bathroom floor.
id="t-57406"&&Really, do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list?
id="t-62391"&&Not so much. 

id="t-63858"&&But I really needed a support network, a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance, that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do.
id="t-78370"&&I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day, who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."
id="t-85584"&&And unfortunately, the local junior high was not going to offer that.
id="t-90971"&&It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate. 

id="t-94805"&&So my mom said, "You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day."
id="t-103191"&&So for the next two years, that's what I did.
id="t-105553"&&I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.
id="t-110040"&&And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture.
id="t-114529"&&There were some people who were really gang-affiliated, and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school.
id="t-120666"&&Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.
id="t-124169"&&You had to survive.
id="t-125883"&&You just had to do things sometimes.
id="t-128536"&&So there were a lot of teachers who were like, "She's never going to make it.
id="t-132315"&&She has an issue with authority.
id="t-133906"&&She's not going to go anywhere."
id="t-135549"&&Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. 

id="t-139642"&&But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school.
id="t-146000"&&I was accepted to Pepperdine University, and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant. 

id="t-153896"&&And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."

And boy, they were like, "What?
And boy, they were like, "What?
id="t-161673"&&Why would you want to do that?"

id="t-163193"&&So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended, and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me.
id="t-174515"&&And so every year, I share my background with my kids, because they need to know that everyone has a story, everyone has a struggle, and everyone needs help along the way.
id="t-186893"&&And I am going to be their help along the way. 

id="t-191021"&&So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.
id="t-197089"&&I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. 

id="t-202943"&&I was like, "You need to go to a hospital, the school nurse, something."

id="t-208714"&&He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.
id="t-210875"&&I need to be in class because I need to graduate."
id="t-213643"&&So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance, but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.
id="t-222850"&&And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- I wanted that, but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year.
id="t-243066"&&How do you get to build those relationships? 

id="t-247118"&&So we created a new school.
id="t-250705"&&And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.
id="t-255722"&&And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding, for support.
id="t-263232"&&But with that, we were going to gain freedom: freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective; freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no; and freedom to control a budget, to spend money where it matters, not how a district or a state says you have to do it.
id="t-289847"&&We wanted those freedoms.
id="t-292150"&&But now, shifting an entire paradigm, it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.
id="t-298871"&&But we had to do it.
id="t-301221"&&Our community deserved a new way of doing things. 

id="t-305342"&&And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District, you better believe there was some opposition.
id="t-315069"&&And it was out of fear -- fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
id="t-320415"&&Yeah, what if we get it wrong?
id="t-322600"&&But what if we get it right?
id="t-324854"&&And we did.
id="t-326929"&&So even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts -- you can't teach, or you don't want to teach, you don't get to be at my school with my kids. 

id="t-339250"&&(Applause) 

id="t-346014"&&So in our third year, how did we do it?
id="t-349686"&&Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.
id="t-353117"&&We make our kids feel like they matter to us.
id="t-355878"&&We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them, and they use all the technology that they're used to.
id="t-362351"&&Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.
id="t-365278"&&Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
id="t-369196"&&And because we connect it to what they're doing â€” For example, they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society.
id="t-377837"&&These were played in the local trolley system.
id="t-380661"&&Teaching elements of persuasion, it doesn't get any more real than that.
id="t-385588"&&Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we've become our own school. 

id="t-390738"&&But it's taken all stakeholders, working together -- teachers and principals on one-year contracts, working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation.
id="t-403877"&&And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say, "Know, the district is trying to impose this, but you have the freedom to do otherwise."
id="t-413509"&&And it takes an active parent center who is not only there, showing a presence every day, but who is part of our governance, making decisions for their kids, our kids. 

id="t-428024"&&Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live?
id="t-433608"&&They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well, and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.
id="t-453704"&&Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception, and we become the norm. 

id="t-461142"&&Thank you. 

id="t-339250"&&(Applause)
