id="t-754"&&Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters.
id="t-12516"&&Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. 

id="t-17685"&&But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
id="t-23929"&&Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
id="t-34858"&&I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. 

id="t-42018"&&Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence.
id="t-51553"&&I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years.
id="t-56337"&&Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
id="t-62092"&&A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
id="t-65617"&&You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
id="t-70729"&&The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
id="t-85460"&&Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
id="t-89551"&&You are ready? 

id="t-91472"&&Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square.
id="t-96201"&&You get a mouth.
id="t-98883"&&This is a person going for a walk.
id="t-101971"&&Person.
id="t-105102"&&If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help!
id="t-105102"&&If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help!
id="t-105102"&&If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help!
id="t-105102"&&If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help!
id="t-123784"&&This is a tree.
id="t-126043"&&Tree.
id="t-128141"&&This is a mountain.
id="t-132566"&&The sun.
id="t-137458"&&The moon.
id="t-142112"&&The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. 

id="t-149793"&&I call these eight characters radicals.
id="t-153531"&&They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters.
id="t-159427"&&A person.
id="t-161165"&&If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."
id="t-165433"&&As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd.
id="t-171287"&&If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big."
id="t-178849"&&The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
id="t-182697"&&He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
id="t-182697"&&He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
id="t-182697"&&He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
id="t-192037"&&Three trees together, we create the forest.
id="t-195593"&&Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
id="t-195593"&&Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
id="t-264142"&&(Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
id="t-210823"&&Remember fire?
id="t-212865"&&Two fires together, I get really hot.
id="t-215526"&&Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
id="t-218385"&&Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
id="t-222986"&&For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
id="t-226078"&&Two suns together, prosperous.
id="t-228257"&&Three together, that's sparkles.
id="t-230615"&&Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness.
id="t-233944"&&It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
id="t-233944"&&It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
id="t-233944"&&It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
id="t-233944"&&It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
id="t-233944"&&It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
id="t-247812"&&Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
id="t-247812"&&Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
id="t-247812"&&Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
id="t-254107"&&This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading.
id="t-259827"&&On the left, we have a woman.
id="t-261980"&&Two women together, they have an argument.
id="t-264142"&&(Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 

id="t-272793"&&So we have gone through almost 30 characters.
id="t-276302"&&By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32.
id="t-281640"&&The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32.
id="t-285595"&&So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
id="t-292715"&&So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
id="t-296262"&&For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain.
id="t-296262"&&For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain.
id="t-301887"&&We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
id="t-305207"&&This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China.
id="t-311752"&&So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
id="t-315642"&&A person behind Japan, what do we get?
id="t-318600"&&A Japanese person. 

id="t-321702"&&The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other.
id="t-326610"&&In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains.
id="t-334636"&&Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
id="t-339647"&&A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. 

id="t-344146"&&This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage.
id="t-344146"&&This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage.

id="t-349670"&&(Applause)
