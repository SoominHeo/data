id="t-473"&&There's a group of people in Kenya.
id="t-5081"&&People cross oceans to go see them.
id="t-9085"&&These people are tall.
id="t-9085"&&These people are tall.
id="t-9085"&&These people are tall.
id="t-15626"&&And they kill lions.
id="t-17738"&&You might be wondering, who are these people?
id="t-20795"&&These are the Maasais.
id="t-20795"&&These are the Maasais.
id="t-20795"&&These are the Maasais.

id="t-29291"&&The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
id="t-33651"&&The girls are brought up to be mothers.
id="t-36898"&&When I was five years old, I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty.
id="t-45080"&&My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by.
id="t-52964"&&(Laughter) Cool, yeah?
id="t-57910"&&And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.
id="t-65706"&&My day started at 5 in the morning, milking the cows, sweeping the house, cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.
id="t-75979"&&I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife. 

id="t-82848"&&I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school.
id="t-88553"&&It's because my mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living.
id="t-99127"&&Why did she say that?
id="t-101656"&&My father worked as a policeman in the city.
id="t-104984"&&He came home once a year.
id="t-106614"&&We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
id="t-109971"&&And whenever he came home, it was a different case.
id="t-113859"&&My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat.
id="t-117730"&&She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us.
id="t-121848"&&But when my father came, he would sell the cows, he would sell the products we had, and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
id="t-131256"&&Because my mother was a woman, she was not allowed to own any property, and by default, everything in my family anyway belongs to my father, so he had the right.
id="t-140816"&&And if my mother ever questioned him, he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult. 

id="t-149893"&&When I went to school, I had a dream.
id="t-152899"&&I wanted to become a teacher.
id="t-155304"&&Teachers looked nice.
id="t-157110"&&They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
id="t-159363"&&I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.
id="t-162466"&&(Laughter) But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm.
id="t-175176"&&So I wanted to become a teacher. 

id="t-177123"&&I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade, it was a determining factor.
id="t-183430"&&In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.
id="t-191417"&&And then I was just finishing my eighth grade, and that was a transition for me to go to high school.
id="t-197536"&&This was the crossroad.
id="t-199117"&&Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
id="t-204639"&&Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
id="t-208881"&&So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out.
id="t-208881"&&So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out.
id="t-208881"&&So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out.
id="t-218096"&&I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school."
id="t-223876"&&The reason why, if I ran away, my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.
id="t-232951"&&It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
id="t-232951"&&It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
id="t-232951"&&It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.

I did.
I did.
id="t-245775"&&It's a whole week long of excitement.
id="t-245775"&&It's a whole week long of excitement.
id="t-245775"&&It's a whole week long of excitement.
id="t-251521"&&And the day before the actual ceremony happens, we were dancing, having excitement, and through all the night we did not sleep.
id="t-260900"&&The actual day came, and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in.
id="t-260900"&&The actual day came, and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in.
id="t-266384"&&We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
id="t-270253"&&They were all in a circle.
id="t-272864"&&And as we danced and danced, and we approached this circle of women, men, women, children, everybody was there.
id="t-280519"&&There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us.
id="t-280519"&&There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us.
id="t-280519"&&There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us.
id="t-297013"&&And I sat down, and I opened my legs.
id="t-300591"&&As I opened my leg, another woman came, and this woman was carrying a knife.
id="t-307415"&&And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off. 

As you can imagine, I bled.
As you can imagine, I bled.
id="t-320651"&&After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
id="t-325749"&&It's something that so many girls -- I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.
id="t-331770"&&It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife, and it was difficult.
id="t-340982"&&I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something that most women don't do.
id="t-346716"&&Three days later, after everybody has left the home, my mom went and brought a nurse.
id="t-351265"&&We were taken care of.
id="t-353119"&&Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.
id="t-357712"&&I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family. 

id="t-365183"&&Well, while I was in high school, something happened.
id="t-368950"&&I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon.
id="t-373797"&&This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera, white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.
id="t-382969"&&There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.
id="t-386896"&&They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads.
id="t-386896"&&They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads.

id="t-394429"&&I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are," because this man looked very happy, and I admired that. 

id="t-403664"&&And he told me, "Well, what do you mean, you want to go?
id="t-407063"&&Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"

id="t-409383"&&And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.
id="t-412188"&&Just tell me how to get there."

id="t-415346"&&This gentleman, he helped me.
id="t-417948"&&While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
id="t-420795"&&He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick, so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.
id="t-427383"&&But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.
id="t-431074"&&Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community, is my father by default -- my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is. 

id="t-440346"&&So the news came, I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and I couldn't come without the support of the village, because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
id="t-454143"&&I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.
id="t-457423"&&But I needed the support of the village, and here again, when the men heard, and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school, they said, "What a lost opportunity.
id="t-457423"&&But I needed the support of the village, and here again, when the men heard, and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school, they said, "What a lost opportunity.
id="t-457423"&&But I needed the support of the village, and here again, when the men heard, and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school, they said, "What a lost opportunity.

id="t-473840"&&So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
id="t-478167"&&There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news.
id="t-483855"&&So I had to come up with something to do with the morning, because there's good news in the morning.
id="t-489119"&&And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder, who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.
id="t-496975"&&So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.
id="t-500630"&&The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me. 

id="t-504391"&&"My child, what are you doing here?"

"Well, Dad, I need help.
"Well, Dad, I need help.
id="t-511215"&&I promised him that I would be the best girl, I will come back, anything they wanted after that, I will do it for them. 

id="t-518840"&&He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
id="t-520934"&&He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them.
id="t-528602"&&They all came together.
id="t-530343"&&The village, the women, the men, everybody came together to support me to come to get an education. 

I arrived in America.
I arrived in America.
id="t-541415"&&I found snow!
id="t-544624"&&I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners, and lots of food in the cafeteria.
id="t-550858"&&I was in a land of plenty. 

id="t-553511"&&I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things.
id="t-561908"&&I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
id="t-570144"&&I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
id="t-573818"&&I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education.
id="t-573818"&&I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education.
id="t-581848"&&And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
id="t-590628"&&I learned that my mom had a right to own property.
id="t-593803"&&I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman.
id="t-599135"&&Those things made me angry.
id="t-602222"&&I wanted to do something.
id="t-604123"&&As I went back, every time I went, I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.
id="t-609660"&&They were getting mutilated, and here, after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N., I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was in my face.
id="t-621903"&&I had to do something. 

id="t-624729"&&As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you.
id="t-624729"&&As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you.

id="t-633968"&&As I spoke to the women, they told me, "You know what we need?
id="t-633968"&&As I spoke to the women, they told me, "You know what we need?
id="t-638062"&&Because there had not been any school for girls.
id="t-640818"&&And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school, the mother is blamed for that.
id="t-648465"&&If she got pregnant before she got married, the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.
id="t-654246"&&She's beaten.
id="t-655887"&&They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."

id="t-659622"&&As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: "We want a school for boys."

id="t-667041"&&And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education.
id="t-673017"&&Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?"
id="t-673017"&&Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?"
id="t-673017"&&Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?"
id="t-680661"&&And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
id="t-680661"&&And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
id="t-680661"&&And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
id="t-690112"&&We have. 

id="t-691571"&&I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.
id="t-694703"&&Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
id="t-694703"&&Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
id="t-694703"&&Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
id="t-694703"&&Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
id="t-694703"&&Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
id="t-709542"&&Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties.
id="t-709542"&&Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties.
id="t-719666"&&And I looked at her, I remember that day, and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
id="t-726786"&&And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
id="t-729682"&&We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
id="t-732652"&&Five months later, that is Angeline.
id="t-735879"&&A transformation had begun in her life.
id="t-738645"&&Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference.
id="t-743120"&&She was not the top student when we took her.
id="t-744920"&&Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.
id="t-744920"&&Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.
id="t-744920"&&Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.
id="t-744920"&&Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.
id="t-744920"&&Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.

id="t-762055"&&As a new dawn is happening in my school, a new beginning is happening.
id="t-767589"&&As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.
id="t-772933"&&One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.
id="t-777629"&&One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
id="t-783597"&&This is the thing that we are doing, giving them opportunities where they can rise.
id="t-789197"&&As we speak right now, women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community. 

id="t-796398"&&(Applause) 

id="t-804078"&&I want to challenge you today.
id="t-806913"&&You are listening to me because you are here, very optimistic.
id="t-812261"&&You are somebody who is so passionate.
id="t-815775"&&You are somebody who wants to see a better world.
id="t-819622"&&You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.
id="t-824128"&&You are somebody who wants to make a difference.
id="t-826877"&&You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.
id="t-830443"&&I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.
id="t-830443"&&I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.

id="t-830443"&&I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.
id="t-844225"&&Move out, because as you change your world, as you change your community, as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family, one village, one country at a time.
id="t-858064"&&We are making a difference, so if you change your world, you are going to change your community, you are going to change your country, and think about that.
id="t-858064"&&We are making a difference, so if you change your world, you are going to change your community, you are going to change your country, and think about that.
