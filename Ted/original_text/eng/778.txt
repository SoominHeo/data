id="t-201"&&The theme of my talk today is, "Be an artist, right now."
id="t-5101"&&Most people, when this subject is brought up, get tense and resist it: "Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.
id="t-13778"&&I have to go to school, get a job, send my kids to lessons ... " You think, "I'm too busy.
id="t-13778"&&I have to go to school, get a job, send my kids to lessons ... " You think, "I'm too busy.
id="t-23976"&&There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
id="t-27437"&&Don't they just pop into your head? 

id="t-28992"&&There are so many reasons why we can't be, indeed, we're not sure why we should be.
id="t-33375"&&We don't know why we should be artists, but we have many reasons why we can't be.
id="t-38971"&&Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
id="t-43346"&&Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
id="t-52266"&&And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
id="t-56609"&&Well you might have, but I don't think so.
id="t-61227"&&This is the theme of my talk today.
id="t-63696"&&We are all born artists. 

id="t-65498"&&If you have kids, you know what I mean.
id="t-68542"&&Almost everything kids do is art.
id="t-73427"&&They draw with crayons on the wall.
id="t-76005"&&They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV, but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.
id="t-83015"&&So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
id="t-88301"&&Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear, and because they practice such art all day long, people honestly get a little tired around kids. 

id="t-100751"&&Kids will sometimes perform monodramas -- playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
id="t-107452"&&And some kids, when they get a bit older, start to lie.
id="t-112151"&&Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
id="t-117242"&&They're shocked.
id="t-117242"&&They're shocked.
id="t-117242"&&They're shocked.
id="t-122155"&&She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"

id="t-125361"&&But you shouldn't worry.
id="t-126932"&&The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
id="t-133152"&&They are talking about things they didn't see.
id="t-133152"&&They are talking about things they didn't see.
id="t-133152"&&They are talking about things they didn't see.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-137131"&&Parents should celebrate.
id="t-148973"&&Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
id="t-153424"&&Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?

id="t-161816"&&When you have a conversation like this, the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
id="t-170513"&&Soon, a story develops.
id="t-172677"&&Of course this is an infantile story, but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does.
id="t-185038"&&In essence, they are not different.
id="t-187417"&&Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels, "Flaubert did not write a novel.
id="t-192709"&&He merely connected one sentence after another.
id="t-195714"&&The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."
id="t-200441"&&That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence, then, without violating the scope of the first one, writing the next sentence.
id="t-208388"&&And you continue to make connections. 

id="t-209897"&&Take a look at this sentence: "One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."
id="t-214430"&&Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
id="t-216876"&&Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it, Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
id="t-226921"&&Kafka did not show his work to his father.
id="t-229670"&&He was not on good terms with his father.
id="t-231994"&&On his own, he wrote these sentences.
id="t-235790"&&Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought. 

And that's right.
And that's right.
id="t-246473"&&A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller.
id="t-251130"&&Kids do art.
id="t-253691"&&They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
id="t-255116"&&I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
id="t-256877"&&When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
id="t-261989"&&But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
id="t-271087"&&But parents tell them, "It will all be washed away by the waves."
id="t-274263"&&In other words, it's useless.
id="t-276085"&&There's no need.
id="t-277229"&&But kids don't mind.
id="t-279095"&&They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand.
id="t-282432"&&Kids don't do it because someone told them to.
id="t-284698"&&They aren't told by their boss or anyone, they just do it. 

id="t-289219"&&When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
id="t-294615"&&When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment, many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
id="t-304901"&&Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend, or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
id="t-312672"&&Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
id="t-316023"&&They talk about these kinds of experiences.
id="t-318346"&&You must have had such a moment.
id="t-320611"&&In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
id="t-320611"&&In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
id="t-320611"&&In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.

id="t-326754"&&The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
id="t-329855"&&It's a bit mischievous, actually.
id="t-329855"&&It's a bit mischievous, actually.

id="t-338002"&&Playing doesn't tire us.
id="t-339663"&&We can play all night long.
id="t-341098"&&If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
id="t-341098"&&If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.

id="t-341098"&&If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
id="t-351497"&&They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family.
id="t-357256"&&Of course, there were kids who had to.
id="t-360032"&&You know this gentleman, right?
id="t-361334"&&He had to tour around Europe to support his family -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -- but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
id="t-370273"&&Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.
id="t-374138"&&Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.

id="t-374138"&&Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.
id="t-386147"&&If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall, you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
id="t-395654"&&Besides, if you continue to act like an artist as you get older, you'll increasingly feel pressure -- people will question your actions and ask you to act properly. 

id="t-411824"&&Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
id="t-418011"&&I was trying my best, and my teacher came around and asked me, "What are you doing?"
id="t-424506"&&"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
id="t-426320"&&"Why are you using only black?"
id="t-428223"&&Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
id="t-430603"&&And I explained, "It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
id="t-436919"&&Then my teacher said, "Really?
id="t-436919"&&Then my teacher said, "Really?
id="t-443239"&&Or so I wished.
id="t-443239"&&Or so I wished.
id="t-443239"&&Or so I wished.
id="t-443239"&&Or so I wished.
id="t-443239"&&Or so I wished.
id="t-450346"&&You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc., but I was coloring everything in black, so he dragged me out of the group.
id="t-457147"&&There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified. 

id="t-460718"&&None of my explanations or excuses were heard, and I really got it big time.
id="t-468383"&&If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before, "Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing, but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.
id="t-478589"&&But such a teacher is seldom found.
id="t-482041"&&Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries -- I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.

id="t-482041"&&Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries -- I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.

id="t-492303"&&Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
id="t-492303"&&Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
id="t-492303"&&Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
id="t-505027"&&Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
id="t-506943"&&No crows are brought up.
id="t-510888"&&Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
id="t-514221"&&Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did.
id="t-524170"&&Of course, my work was very amateur, but let's turn to more famous examples. 

id="t-530207"&&This is Picasso's.
id="t-530207"&&This is Picasso's.
id="t-530207"&&This is Picasso's.
id="t-538609"&&Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
id="t-543253"&&That was Duchamp.
id="t-544847"&&So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
id="t-553424"&&Picasso even made the statement, "I draw not what I see but what I think."
id="t-558989"&&Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
id="t-558989"&&Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
id="t-558989"&&Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
id="t-565577"&&Unfortunately, the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
id="t-574866"&&They get locked in.
id="t-576471"&&That's our tragedy. 

id="t-577554"&&So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
id="t-582814"&&Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
id="t-584197"&&We want to express, to reveal ourselves, but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
id="t-592532"&&In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing "She's Gone" or "Hotel California," miming the guitar riffs.

id="t-592532"&&In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing "She's Gone" or "Hotel California," miming the guitar riffs.
id="t-602603"&&Some people turn into rockers like this.
id="t-605082"&&Or some people dance in clubs.
id="t-607155"&&People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long.
id="t-613567"&&That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. 

id="t-616962"&&Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
id="t-616962"&&Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
id="t-616962"&&Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
id="t-625633"&&The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else, but the dad alone builds castles.
id="t-631277"&&This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
id="t-635755"&&But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
id="t-635755"&&But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
id="t-635755"&&But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
id="t-644841"&&TV is full of people who do what we wished to do, but never got to.
id="t-650609"&&They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.
id="t-656738"&&So we start to envy them.
id="t-659888"&&We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
id="t-659888"&&We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
id="t-659888"&&We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
id="t-659888"&&We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
id="t-669835"&&We easily say these sorts of things.
id="t-672125"&&We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
id="t-679605"&&That's what I think. 

id="t-683191"&&What should we do then?
id="t-685029"&&Yes, that's right.
id="t-685806"&&Right now, we need to start our own art.
id="t-689000"&&Right this minute, we can turn off TV, log off the Internet, get up and start to do something.
id="t-695158"&&Where I teach students in drama school, there's a course called Dramatics.
id="t-699627"&&In this course, all students must put on a play.
id="t-703817"&&However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
id="t-707929"&&They can write the play, for example, and the writers may work on stage art.
id="t-712673"&&Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
id="t-714984"&&Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it, but later they have so much fun.
id="t-714984"&&Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it, but later they have so much fun.
id="t-723295"&&In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
id="t-727457"&&I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays. 

id="t-732353"&&I have another experience: In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
id="t-738919"&&I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.
id="t-744819"&&Some major in art or music and think they can't write.
id="t-749396"&&So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
id="t-753123"&&It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
id="t-753123"&&It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
id="t-753123"&&It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
id="t-761164"&&I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!"
id="t-761164"&&I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!"
id="t-767641"&&They only get to think for the first five minutes. 

id="t-770849"&&The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind, the artistic devil creeps in.
id="t-779276"&&This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you.
id="t-779276"&&This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you.
id="t-779276"&&This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you.
id="t-779276"&&This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you.
id="t-790623"&&It will say a lot of things.
id="t-792200"&&You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
id="t-794704"&&The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline, but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil.
id="t-808335"&&The students go into a kind of trance.
id="t-810174"&&After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
id="t-814636"&&And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears. 

id="t-817601"&&So I can say this: It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist, but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
id="t-827575"&&Why we cannot be something is not important.
id="t-829284"&&Most artists became artists because of the one reason.
id="t-832434"&&When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art, enemies appear on the outside.
id="t-832434"&&When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art, enemies appear on the outside.

id="t-867504"&&The magic question is, "What for?"
id="t-871166"&&But art is not for anything.
id="t-874878"&&Art is the ultimate goal.
id="t-877132"&&It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
id="t-881272"&&It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
id="t-886778"&&So in response to such a pragmatic question, we need to be bold.
