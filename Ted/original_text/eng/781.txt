id="t-964"&&When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
id="t-6966"&&My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio.
id="t-13611"&&There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him. 

"The Taliban are gone!"
"The Taliban are gone!"

id="t-25343"&&I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy. 

id="t-33117"&&"You can go to a real school now," he said. 

id="t-41628"&&A morning that I will never forget.
id="t-46797"&&A real school.
id="t-51965"&&You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
id="t-58596"&&So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school.
id="t-69629"&&It was the only way we both could be educated.
id="t-74254"&&Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.
id="t-81511"&&We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.
id="t-89841"&&The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
id="t-97880"&&It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
id="t-103730"&&We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
id="t-110605"&&From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
id="t-116894"&&We always wondered what they knew about us.
id="t-119674"&&Were we being followed?
id="t-122706"&&Do they know where we live?
id="t-126238"&&We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be. 

id="t-135822"&&I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
id="t-145809"&&My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
id="t-150960"&&A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
id="t-164348"&&But my educated mother became a teacher.
id="t-167858"&&There she is.
id="t-170884"&&She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
id="t-178929"&&And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
id="t-190218"&&There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
id="t-201836"&&To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
id="t-210182"&&During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.
id="t-222355"&&I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
id="t-222355"&&I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
id="t-222355"&&I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
id="t-240680"&&But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will.
id="t-254906"&&So do you still not want to continue?"

id="t-259988"&&Today I am 22.
id="t-263116"&&I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
id="t-269056"&&Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
id="t-279266"&&Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. 

id="t-284581"&&(Applause) 

id="t-294594"&&When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me.
id="t-305615"&&He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. 

id="t-284581"&&(Applause) 

id="t-321040"&&My family believes in me.
id="t-323689"&&I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
id="t-328639"&&That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women.
id="t-335870"&&That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
id="t-348282"&&The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
id="t-357675"&&And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. 

Like Ahmed.
Like Ahmed.
id="t-383091"&&Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes.
id="t-401536"&&As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again. 

id="t-413806"&&"Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas."

id="t-426434"&&What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success.
id="t-447536"&&It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
id="t-451474"&&In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.
id="t-466181"&&Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
id="t-473861"&&But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. 

id="t-284581"&&(Applause) 

id="t-486600"&&Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
id="t-492751"&&I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
id="t-497723"&&I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
id="t-505265"&&But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change.
id="t-524110"&&To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
id="t-539397"&&Like me, they are dreaming big. 

id="t-542604"&&Thank you. 

id="t-284581"&&(Applause)
