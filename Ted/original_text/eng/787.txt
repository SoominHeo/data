id="t-628"&&Salaam alaikum.
id="t-3544"&&Welcome to Doha.
id="t-5230"&&I am in charge of making this country's food secure.
id="t-8632"&&That is my job for the next two years, to design an entire master plan, and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course, with so many other people.
id="t-18652"&&But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story, about the story of this country that you're all here in today.
id="t-27167"&&And of course, most of you have had three meals today, and probably will continue to have after this event. 

id="t-35250"&&So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?
id="t-39683"&&We were about 11,000 people living here.
id="t-39683"&&We were about 11,000 people living here.
id="t-39683"&&We were about 11,000 people living here.
id="t-50899"&&Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages, fishing, or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.
id="t-60716"&&None of the glamour that you see today existed.
id="t-64118"&&No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.
id="t-69266"&&It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.
id="t-71883"&&Resources weren't there to develop them.
id="t-73982"&&And you can see that life expectancy was also short.
id="t-76815"&&Most people died around the age of 50. 

id="t-78717"&&So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
id="t-82516"&&1939, that's when they discovered oil.
id="t-85733"&&But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War.
id="t-92983"&&What did it do?
id="t-95117"&&It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
id="t-98417"&&It also made all those people who roamed around the desert -- looking for water, looking for food, trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize. 

id="t-109536"&&You might find this strange, but in my family we have different accents.
id="t-115349"&&My mother has an accent that is so different to my father, and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.
id="t-124383"&&There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
id="t-124383"&&There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
id="t-124383"&&There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
id="t-131733"&&Because we lived scattered.
id="t-133516"&&We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.
id="t-138668"&&And when the resources came, be it oil, we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.
id="t-149183"&&People started to get to know each other.
id="t-151567"&&And we realized that there are some differences in accents. 

id="t-155516"&&So that is the chapter two: the oil era.
id="t-158451"&&Let's look at today.
id="t-160566"&&This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.
id="t-165292"&&So what's the population today?
id="t-166683"&&It's 1.7 million people.
id="t-168933"&&That is in less than 60 years.
id="t-171632"&&The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.
id="t-177534"&&Lifespan has increased to 78.
id="t-180367"&&Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.
id="t-185176"&&And this is amongst the highest worldwide.
id="t-188583"&&From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.
id="t-196234"&&I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. 

id="t-200000"&&But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
id="t-206200"&&The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
id="t-206200"&&The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
id="t-206200"&&The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
id="t-220933"&&Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.
id="t-224866"&&This is history being made in this region.
id="t-227382"&&Not only cities that we're building, but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.
id="t-234452"&&Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.
id="t-237601"&&These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.
id="t-243800"&&But of course, with the use of technology.
id="t-245769"&&So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
id="t-252283"&&Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate. 

id="t-255134"&&The question is how.
id="t-257150"&&How could we survive that?
id="t-260416"&&We have no water whatsoever.
id="t-262500"&&Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
id="t-262500"&&Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
id="t-262500"&&Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
id="t-272967"&&It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of, probably most of you used it coming to Doha.
id="t-280466"&&So that is our lake, if you can see it.
id="t-283367"&&That is our river.
id="t-285216"&&That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.
id="t-290558"&&This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination. 

id="t-297184"&&So what are the risks?
id="t-299452"&&Do you worry much?
id="t-301002"&&I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts, you will realize, of course I have to worry.
id="t-307509"&&There is growing demand, growing population.
id="t-310018"&&We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.
id="t-313267"&&And so that number also demands food.
id="t-316759"&&And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050. 

id="t-319967"&&So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.
id="t-326474"&&There's also changing diets.
id="t-328806"&&By elevating to a higher socio-economic level, they also change their diet.
id="t-335055"&&They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.
id="t-338055"&&On the other hand, there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors.
id="t-343106"&&And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. 

id="t-348274"&&This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.
id="t-352089"&&We only have two days of water reserve.
id="t-355439"&&We import 90 percent of our food, and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
id="t-361423"&&The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.
id="t-372955"&&So we also face risks.
id="t-376206"&&These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. 

id="t-383389"&&The question is, is there a solution?
id="t-385907"&&Is there a sustainable solution?
id="t-388089"&&Indeed there is.
id="t-390073"&&This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years.
id="t-396790"&&Let's start with the water.
id="t-398222"&&So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.
id="t-401991"&&So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
id="t-401991"&&So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
id="t-401991"&&So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
id="t-407388"&&Or should we use something else?
id="t-409783"&&Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?
id="t-413122"&&I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.
id="t-417256"&&And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.
id="t-422588"&&And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
id="t-430598"&&And that is a lot of water. 

id="t-432622"&&That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food.
id="t-441257"&&But in order to sustain the horizontal line -- because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver -- we need to also develop the vertical line: system sustenance, high-level education, research and development, industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.
id="t-459719"&&But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.
id="t-465852"&&Without it we can't do anything. 

id="t-468085"&&So that's what we are planning to do.
id="t-469637"&&Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation.
id="t-475135"&&Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.
id="t-488970"&&We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever as a city, to live in peace. 

id="t-497626"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-499571"&&(Applause)
