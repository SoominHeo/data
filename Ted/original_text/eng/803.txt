id="t-790"&&The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.
id="t-6881"&&Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.
id="t-13641"&&With complete control of everything the audience can see, moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. 

id="t-27773"&&Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life, produced by the sequential projection of still frames, and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.
id="t-41299"&&Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect.
id="t-53142"&&Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years.
id="t-59521"&&Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.
id="t-72571"&&Playing with the world, and our perception of it, really is the essence of visual effects.
id="t-79277"&&So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery. 

id="t-91459"&&Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions: assumption, things are as we know them; presumption, things will behave as we expect; and context in reality, our knowledge of the world as we know it, such as scale. 

id="t-111247"&&Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession, which is, never betray the illusion.
id="t-119429"&&And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection.
id="t-125884"&&So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.
id="t-140898"&&I hope you will enjoy.
