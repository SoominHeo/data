Thank you.
Thank you.

id="t-169048"&&For the last 15 years that I have been performing, all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.
id="t-178709"&&See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.
id="t-181165"&&It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition, and while those things hold weight, it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.
id="t-189925"&&The hunger and thirst was, and still remains: How do I get people who hate poetry to love me?
id="t-199629"&&Because I'm an extension of my work, and if they love me, then they will love my work, and if they love my work, then they will love poetry, and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job, which is to transcend it to the world. 

id="t-213352"&&And in 1996, I found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines, who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."
id="t-227717"&&And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room, and I read him one of my pieces, and you know what he told me?
id="t-236350"&&"Yo' wack.
id="t-238307"&&You know what the problem is with you, homie?
id="t-241341"&&You don't read other people's poetry, and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration."
id="t-241341"&&You don't read other people's poetry, and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration."

Now I could have quit.
Now I could have quit.
id="t-263490"&&I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.
id="t-266970"&&I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. 

id="t-270355"&&So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.
id="t-274338"&&When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.
id="t-277755"&&I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning to ask him who's the best poet.
id="t-283611"&&I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food. 

id="t-290379"&&Then one day I told him, "Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?"
id="t-290379"&&Then one day I told him, "Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?"
id="t-333699"&&I wanted to know which poet he read, and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"], a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be: Broadway, baby.
id="t-349843"&&And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body. 

id="t-357023"&&But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.
id="t-359731"&&The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business. 

id="t-376729"&&And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool, you're a failed actor who became an agent, and you know why you failed as an actor?

id="t-388682"&&I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space, and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience.

id="t-413125"&&I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM.
