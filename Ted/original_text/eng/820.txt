id="t-485"&&I'm a designer and an educator.
id="t-3381"&&I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.
id="t-12388"&&But how efficient is, really, this multitasking? 

id="t-17353"&&Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.
id="t-23058"&&A couple of examples.
id="t-25973"&&Look at that.
id="t-25973"&&Look at that.
id="t-25973"&&Look at that.

id="t-40539"&&So someone tells us the story about supertaskers, so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment.
id="t-52134"&&But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?
id="t-56738"&&When's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend?
id="t-62309"&&So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super, hyper â€” (Laughter) (Applause) to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function. 

id="t-85872"&&Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?
id="t-88649"&&How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island.
id="t-95345"&&But our multitasking reality is pretty different, and full of tons of information.
id="t-103059"&&So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure? 

id="t-109763"&&I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge, but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task, or maybe turning your digital senses totally off. 

id="t-131260"&&So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
id="t-131260"&&So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
id="t-131260"&&So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
id="t-143604"&&Thank you.
