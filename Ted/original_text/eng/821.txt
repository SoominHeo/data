id="t-506"&&I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. 

id="t-4992"&&There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
id="t-8993"&&Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.
id="t-13601"&&When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly, greedy creatures that are just after your flesh, associated with politicians.

id="t-40959"&&First of all, why do they have such a bad press?
id="t-44551"&&When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture, and he said, "These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity."

id="t-69378"&&They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) — personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters. 

id="t-77461"&&More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press — (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with.

id="t-126938"&&So there's two types of vultures in this planet.
id="t-130889"&&There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras, and then the Old World vultures, where we have 16 species.

So why are vultures important?

id="t-151875"&&They're our natural garbage collectors.
id="t-154169"&&They clean up carcasses right to the bone.
id="t-154169"&&They clean up carcasses right to the bone.
id="t-154169"&&They clean up carcasses right to the bone.
id="t-167197"&&Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. 

id="t-178403"&&Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.
id="t-181819"&&They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.
id="t-185063"&&Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood, and together with the cobra, symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.
id="t-195365"&&In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god, and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana.
id="t-207102"&&In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important sky burials.

id="t-220497"&&So what is the problem with vultures?
id="t-222964"&&We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya, of which six are highly threatened with extinction.
id="t-229822"&&The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human-wildlife conflicts.

id="t-244708"&&In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.
id="t-262634"&&This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India, and they have taken a stand.
id="t-268250"&&Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites, and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb of rabies.

id="t-281922"&&Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa: 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.
id="t-288603"&&I am not against wind energy, but we need to work with the governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.

id="t-296692"&&They are bird-blending machines.
id="t-299526"&&In West Africa, there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. 

So what's being done?

So what's being done?
id="t-313687"&&We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
id="t-318502"&&We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.
id="t-323839"&&We need to work with governments in regional levels.
id="t-326546"&&We're working with local communities.
id="t-329482"&&We're talking to them about appreciating vultures, about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.
