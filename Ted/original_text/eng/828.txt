id="t-578"&&I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist, I'm actually interested in how the brain learns, and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter, better and faster.

id="t-81319"&&Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra? 

id="t-87429"&&So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
id="t-91724"&&Now I want to step back a bit.
id="t-93572"&&I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
id="t-101533"&&(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you, right?
id="t-110227"&&And I'm almost sure most of you have thought, "Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies?"
id="t-120052"&&I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare.
id="t-120052"&&I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare.
id="t-133875"&&Most parents would find that great.
id="t-136612"&&Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health.
id="t-142924"&&It's not, and binging is never good.
id="t-146124"&&But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses, actually the very game I showed you at the beginning, those action-packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. 

id="t-163302"&&There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you, right?
id="t-163302"&&There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you, right?
id="t-174389"&&I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab.
id="t-183220"&&What we do in the lab is actually measure directly, in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact of video games on the brain.
id="t-191629"&&And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work. 

id="t-194964"&&One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse.
id="t-202664"&&That's a statement about vision.
id="t-204867"&&There may be vision scientists among you.
id="t-207403"&&We actually know how to test that statement.
id="t-210342"&&We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
id="t-210342"&&We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
id="t-210342"&&We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
id="t-210342"&&We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
id="t-226636"&&The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week, 10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
id="t-234240"&&By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
id="t-234240"&&By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
id="t-234240"&&By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
id="t-240165"&&It's better than those that don't play.
id="t-242605"&&And it's better in two different ways.
id="t-244877"&&The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight.
id="t-260548"&&The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.
id="t-260548"&&The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.
id="t-260548"&&The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.
id="t-275668"&&So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision, and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better.
id="t-286493"&&Clearly, when it comes to action video games, screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse. 

id="t-293037"&&Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around: Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
id="t-301397"&&Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
id="t-305302"&&I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
id="t-308903"&&I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me.
id="t-308903"&&I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me.

id="t-342818"&&Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color.
id="t-349685"&&How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better than some of us that are older.
id="t-360356"&&What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster.
id="t-367844"&&So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. 

id="t-373535"&&Actually, those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention, and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world.

id="t-397420"&&In the lab, we get people to come to the lab, sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.

Good.
Good.
Good.
id="t-524241"&&The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls how we sustain attention, and another one is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict.
id="t-535250"&&Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. 

id="t-544218"&&This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain.
id="t-544218"&&This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain.

id="t-579830"&&Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
id="t-582706"&&We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have.
id="t-582706"&&We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have.
id="t-582706"&&We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have.
id="t-598716"&&When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
id="t-598716"&&When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
id="t-598716"&&When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.

id="t-608851"&&Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
id="t-608851"&&Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
id="t-608851"&&Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
id="t-635220"&&That's a multimedia-tasker.
id="t-637556"&&There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
id="t-652163"&&When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad. 

Right?
Right?
id="t-660092"&&The first one is that not all media are created equal.
id="t-663284"&&You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games.
id="t-663284"&&You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games.
id="t-676348"&&Even within video games, I'm telling you right now about these action-packed video games.
id="t-680941"&&Different video games have a different effect on your brains.
id="t-684275"&&So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. 

id="t-689468"&&The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
id="t-693755"&&I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc.
id="t-703267"&&Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
id="t-714803"&&So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, "Not possible."
id="t-714803"&&So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, "Not possible."
id="t-723635"&&That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. 

id="t-730172"&&Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.
id="t-730172"&&Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.
id="t-730172"&&Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.

id="t-730172"&&Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.
id="t-764203"&&So it's the same way, like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games, either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. 

id="t-787600"&&Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform.
id="t-801155"&&I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game, I can actually change your vision for the better, whether you want to play that action game or not, right?
id="t-813954"&&That's the point of rehabilitation or education.
id="t-816370"&&Most of the kids don't go to school saying, "Great, two hours of math!"

id="t-821036"&&So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that, we need to go one more step.
id="t-827939"&&And one more step is to do training studies.
id="t-830963"&&So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation.
id="t-837931"&&Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you, and again you're going to do the task, to look at this shape.
id="t-837931"&&Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you, and again you're going to do the task, to look at this shape.
id="t-850930"&&One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape.

id="t-850930"&&One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape.
id="t-869862"&&That's our target shape.
id="t-869862"&&That's our target shape.
id="t-869862"&&That's our target shape.
id="t-869862"&&That's our target shape.
id="t-878539"&&Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing, right?
id="t-882760"&&It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. 

id="t-886192"&&Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
id="t-895836"&&They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.
id="t-898582"&&They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks.
id="t-905993"&&Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.
id="t-905993"&&Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.
id="t-905993"&&Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.
id="t-905993"&&Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.

id="t-905993"&&Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.

id="t-946017"&&Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example? 

id="t-964967"&&Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.
id="t-969447"&&There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation.
id="t-981294"&&There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist.
id="t-992646"&&That's the chocolate side of the equation.
id="t-996174"&&The issue is we need to put the two together, and it's a little bit like with food.
id="t-1001454"&&Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
id="t-1001454"&&Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
id="t-1001454"&&Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
id="t-1001454"&&Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
id="t-1001454"&&Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
id="t-1047070"&&I'd like to leave you with that thought, and thank you for your attention.
id="t-1052219"&&(Applause) (Applause)
