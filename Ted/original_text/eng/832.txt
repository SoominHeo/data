id="t-1332"&&So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
id="t-5417"&&It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it.
id="t-10433"&&So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
id="t-13966"&&What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife.
id="t-13966"&&What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife.
id="t-18714"&&On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
id="t-18714"&&On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
id="t-18714"&&On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
id="t-18714"&&On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
id="t-25960"&&My wife replied, "None of your business."
id="t-29229"&&Then, being her husband, I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
id="t-32856"&&I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
id="t-35824"&&Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days. 

id="t-40927"&&Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
id="t-42712"&&She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
id="t-42712"&&She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
id="t-42712"&&She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
id="t-54693"&&And it's called affordability.
id="t-57183"&&I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
id="t-61505"&&I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
id="t-64666"&&That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
id="t-64666"&&That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.

id="t-64666"&&That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.

id="t-80404"&&The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
id="t-86434"&&I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
id="t-91494"&&They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
id="t-96134"&&Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
id="t-105257"&&Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
id="t-110071"&&That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?
id="t-114476"&&It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
id="t-114476"&&It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
id="t-114476"&&It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
id="t-120652"&&Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
id="t-124232"&&So only problem: the only available victim is my wife. 

id="t-129636"&&Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
id="t-129636"&&Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
id="t-129636"&&Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
id="t-142205"&&Close your eyes."
id="t-144156"&&Because I tried to make it intimate.
id="t-147230"&&Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
id="t-150441"&&(Laughter) So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
id="t-156539"&&Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
id="t-159655"&&But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
id="t-163052"&&That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
id="t-166094"&&They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
id="t-169653"&&Why I am not getting [any]?
id="t-171349"&&You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
id="t-179437"&&Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
id="t-179437"&&Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
id="t-179437"&&Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
id="t-187980"&&Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.
id="t-187980"&&Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.
id="t-187980"&&Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.

I wore a sanitary pad.
I wore a sanitary pad.
id="t-214147"&&That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect.
id="t-214147"&&That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect.
id="t-223809"&&My God, it's unbelievable. 

id="t-229463"&&But here the problem is, one company is making napkin out of cotton.

id="t-229463"&&But here the problem is, one company is making napkin out of cotton.
id="t-239648"&&That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
id="t-243232"&&You need first funds.
id="t-244933"&&Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
id="t-244933"&&Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
id="t-244933"&&Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
id="t-257465"&&She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls.
id="t-262775"&&Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material.
id="t-262775"&&Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material.
id="t-273790"&&Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
id="t-280215"&&In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant, anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
id="t-289995"&&That is my invention. 

id="t-293212"&&So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.

id="t-293212"&&So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.
id="t-313292"&&A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating.
id="t-317457"&&Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
id="t-319703"&&Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
id="t-323220"&&What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
id="t-326529"&&That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads.
id="t-326529"&&That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads.

id="t-349620"&&So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries. 

id="t-355637"&&Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
id="t-365137"&&A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
id="t-368422"&&That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
id="t-374522"&&(Applause) Play video one. 

id="t-382530"&&(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
id="t-387702"&&She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
id="t-395914"&&Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
id="t-400335"&&So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups.
id="t-409976"&&That is my idea. 

id="t-414429"&&AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all.
id="t-414429"&&AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all.
id="t-422644"&&They are performing puja.
id="t-424513"&&(Video): (Singing) You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
id="t-448004"&&I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
id="t-450888"&&I'm sustaining on seventh year.
id="t-450888"&&I'm sustaining on seventh year.
id="t-450888"&&I'm sustaining on seventh year.
id="t-454719"&&I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
id="t-460584"&&In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create.
id="t-464627"&&That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
id="t-468183"&&I'm doing something serious.
id="t-469683"&&If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
id="t-474032"&&Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
id="t-476430"&&Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
id="t-478781"&&Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
id="t-478781"&&Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
id="t-478781"&&Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.

id="t-478781"&&Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
id="t-478781"&&Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
id="t-496011"&&I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
id="t-498854"&&I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.
id="t-498854"&&I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.
id="t-498854"&&I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.
id="t-498854"&&I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.
id="t-513636"&&So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
id="t-513636"&&So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
