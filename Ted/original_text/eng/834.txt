id="t-66357"&&It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up, that has fascinated people throughout history.

id="t-149084"&&Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting.
id="t-154043"&&They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army.
id="t-160368"&&It sounds a little bit like a weird book, but actually they're all new types of lies. 

Let's start with the Butlers.

id="t-239455"&&Let me give you a very recent example, as in, like, last week.
id="t-242971"&&Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
id="t-246239"&&Here's one of his bestselling books.
id="t-248259"&&Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.
id="t-251672"&&My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is, "Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."
id="t-258137"&&And of course, you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.

id="t-266854"&&Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.

id="t-295327"&&In North America, we call this Astroturfing, and Astroturfing is very common now.
id="t-302382"&&We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews, everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not. 

id="t-310404"&&Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception, you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us a deceptive species, especially when you think about the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.
id="t-324870"&&But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.
id="t-329608"&&Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in.
id="t-334756"&&I can assure you there's deception there.
id="t-337085"&&And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country.
id="t-337085"&&And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country.
id="t-344702"&&Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.
id="t-349793"&&Those are the conversations that really matter.
id="t-352201"&&What does technology do to deception with those folks? 

Here's a couple of studies.
Here's a couple of studies.
id="t-378309"&&And it really throws people for a loop because we think, well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?
id="t-384446"&&The phone, in contrast, the most lies.
id="t-388750"&&Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
id="t-395414"&&This tends to be very different from what people expect. 

What about résumés?
What about résumés?
id="t-415060"&&And what we found, to many people's surprise, was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers, like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job. 

id="t-426444"&&How about Facebook itself?
id="t-428740"&&You know, we always think that hey, there are these idealized versions, people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives.
id="t-428740"&&You know, we always think that hey, there are these idealized versions, people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives.
id="t-435407"&&My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.
id="t-438475"&&Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.
id="t-442296"&&They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.
id="t-446514"&&Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook, and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated, meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. 

id="t-460309"&&All right, well, what about online dating?
id="t-462881"&&I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
id="t-462881"&&I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
id="t-462881"&&I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
id="t-473004"&&Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did is we brought people, online daters, into the lab, and then we measured them.

id="t-492814"&&Here's an example of the men and the height.
id="t-496743"&&Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.

id="t-508705"&&Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
id="t-511818"&&What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.
id="t-514685"&&In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch, what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up."

id="t-912553"&&Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing.
id="t-922076"&&They were inserting themselves into the hotel review, kind of trying to convince you they were there.
id="t-928468"&&In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spatial information.
id="t-937814"&&They said how big the bathroom was, or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel. 

Now, you guys did pretty well.

id="t-949012"&&Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
id="t-955061"&&This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.

id="t-1030303"&&First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
id="t-1034791"&&Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine, but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to, and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms.
id="t-1044986"&&So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.
id="t-1048159"&&But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives, I think we can go back to Diogenes and Confucius.
