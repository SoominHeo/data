id="t-545"&&Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, three days after the earthquake.
id="t-16135"&&We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go, the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks, we realized something.

id="t-27848"&&And coming home, my cofounder and I, we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.
id="t-33586"&&The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.

id="t-33586"&&The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.
id="t-42287"&&The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration, and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.
id="t-54426"&&And we sat here and we looked at these two problems, and finally we came to a realization.

id="t-62502"&&Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home.
id="t-67973"&&Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform.
id="t-72713"&&And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.
id="t-76383"&&Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010, we responded to the tsunami in Chile, the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.
id="t-86349"&&But it was earlier this year, when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. 

This is Clay Hunt.
This is Clay Hunt.
id="t-95831"&&We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
id="t-95831"&&We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
id="t-95831"&&We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
id="t-102091"&&Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.
id="t-105977"&&This was a tragedy, but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing.
id="t-111985"&&You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan.

id="t-124671"&&And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth. 

id="t-129106"&&And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems -- in the initial iteration of our organization, we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service.

id="t-149159"&&But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly, now moving forward, we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.
id="t-159937"&&Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.
id="t-165728"&&And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. 

id="t-171660"&&Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.

id="t-180109"&&They send him to Iraq.
id="t-181781"&&Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.
id="t-184508"&&That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.
id="t-188112"&&It's to keep the men around him alive.
id="t-190201"&&It's to pacify the village that he works in.

id="t-205513"&&Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army, the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.
id="t-213215"&&Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.

id="t-224165"&&He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.
id="t-224165"&&He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.
id="t-229623"&&He doesn't have that community anymore.
id="t-230962"&&But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri, they get that sense of community back. 

id="t-236687"&&Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City.

id="t-253423"&&He doesn't have that same self-worth.
id="t-255696"&&But you send him to Joplin after a tornado, and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service, now they have self-worth again. 

id="t-264819"&&I think it's very important, because right now somebody needs to step up, and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance.
