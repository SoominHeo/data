id="t-860"&&I've got a confession.
id="t-2580"&&I love looking through people's garbage.
id="t-5812"&&Now, it's not some creepy thing.
id="t-7741"&&I'm usually just looking for old electronics, stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
id="t-12381"&&I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
id="t-16044"&&Each one's got three different motors, so now you can build things that move.
id="t-20638"&&There's switches so you can turn things on and off.
id="t-23377"&&There's even a freaking laser, so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot. 

id="t-30778"&&Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage, and some of these things have even been kind of useful.
id="t-36773"&&But here's the thing, for me, garbage is just a chance to play, to be creative and build things to amuse myself.
id="t-43554"&&This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
id="t-47214"&&I lead a university-based biological research lab, where we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
id="t-53756"&&We aren't focused on any particular problem, and we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
id="t-58962"&&This is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers.
id="t-65470"&&And I realized a long time ago that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage I find, it's a great way to foster creativity.
id="t-75549"&&And what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab.
id="t-81669"&&And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas, it's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor. 

id="t-89620"&&So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart, and I had this sudden idea: Could I treat biology like hardware?
id="t-98889"&&Could I dismantle a biological system, mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way?
id="t-105946"&&My lab started working on this, and I want to show you the result. 

id="t-111601"&&Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is? 

id="t-115278"&&Audience: Apple! 

id="t-116453"&&Andrew Pelling: That's right -- it's an apple.
id="t-118634"&&Now, I actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples.
id="t-124294"&&And that's because we grew human cells into it.
id="t-127044"&&We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple, removed all the apple cells and DNA and then implanted human cells.
id="t-136332"&&And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold.
id="t-141170"&&This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
id="t-144331"&&And these little holes that you can see, this is where all the apple cells used to be.
id="t-149254"&&So then we come along, we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
id="t-153548"&&What happens is, these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold. 

id="t-158414"&&As weird as this is, it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
id="t-164955"&&And we found in our pre-clinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive.
id="t-175348"&&This is the point when people started asking me, "Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"
id="t-183794"&&And I'm like, "You've come to the right place."

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-187715"&&I actually brought this up with my wife.
id="t-189924"&&She's a musical instrument maker, and she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
id="t-194529"&&So I asked her, "Could you, like, literally carve some ears out of an apple for us?"
id="t-201682"&&And she did.
id="t-203157"&&So I took her ears to the lab.
id="t-205953"&&We then started preparing them.
id="t-208979"&&Yeah, I know. 

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-213397"&&It's a good lab, man. 

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-216624"&&And then we grew cells on them.
id="t-219008"&&And this is the result. 

id="t-221916"&&Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
id="t-227778"&&People have actually been working on this for decades.
id="t-231138"&&Here's the issue: commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic, because they're sourced from proprietary products, animals or cadavers.
id="t-247259"&&We used an apple and it cost pennies. 

id="t-250873"&&What's also really cool here is it's not that hard to make these things.
id="t-255103"&&The equipment you need can be built from garbage, and the key processing step only requires soap and water.
id="t-262866"&&So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
id="t-267393"&&And then we founded a mission-driven company, and we're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home.
id="t-276132"&&What I'm really curious about is if one day, it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen. 

id="t-289321"&&Speaking of kitchens, here's some asparagus.
id="t-293402"&&They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny. 

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-297386"&&Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus, what you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
id="t-305658"&&And when we image them in the lab, you can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
id="t-310832"&&This image reminds me of two things: our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord. 

id="t-319854"&&So here's the question: Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
id="t-326064"&&Because if we can, then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
id="t-335627"&&Or maybe even a spinal cord.
id="t-338126"&&Don't get me wrong -- this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do, and we are not the only ones working on this.
id="t-346116"&&But we are the only ones using asparagus. 

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-352060"&&Right now, we've got really promising pilot data.
id="t-355202"&&And we're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what's actually possible. 

id="t-360793"&&So listen, all of the work I've shown you, the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
id="t-373393"&&Play -- play is a key part of my scientific practice.
id="t-379454"&&It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears. 

id="t-386491"&&So, the next time any of you are looking at some old, broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology, I want you to think of me.
id="t-398199"&&Because I want it. 

id="t-186049"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-400556"&&Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me, and let's see what we can build. 

id="t-406552"&&Thank you. 

id="t-407727"&&(Applause)
