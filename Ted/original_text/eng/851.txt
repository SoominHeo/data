id="t-89789"&&BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right?
id="t-94760"&&But we're talking about perception here, right?
id="t-97490"&&And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception.
id="t-108469"&&Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.
id="t-114873"&&But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently? 

id="t-121566"&&Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently, and all new perceptions begin in the same way.
id="t-129617"&&They begin with a question.
id="t-132199"&&The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.

id="t-190060"&&It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. 

id="t-198358"&&So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
id="t-203168"&&It's play.
id="t-203168"&&It's play.

id="t-233682"&&Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist.
id="t-242330"&&Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.
id="t-245357"&&It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative.
id="t-251150"&&So if you add rules to play, you have a game.
id="t-255353"&&That's actually what an experiment is. 

id="t-258143"&&So armed with these two ideas, that science is a way of being and experiments are play, we asked, can anyone become a scientist?
id="t-267837"&&And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

id="t-287233"&&The first step was to ask a question. 

id="t-290641"&&Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.

id="t-373990"&&But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals.
id="t-385496"&&So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way.
id="t-390956"&&Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions.
id="t-390956"&&Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions.
id="t-402164"&&Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells.
id="t-407241"&&But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from.
id="t-350931"&&(Applause) 

id="t-422015"&&BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game.
id="t-422015"&&BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game.

id="t-436009"&&AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
id="t-439032"&&We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.
id="t-446977"&&They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
id="t-456564"&&Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle.
id="t-456564"&&Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle.
id="t-462574"&&What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
id="t-467697"&&It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults.
id="t-68000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-473874"&&BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
id="t-477338"&&It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project.
