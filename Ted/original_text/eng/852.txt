id="t-5024"&&So the bad news is that we all get sick.
id="t-10239"&&And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is, how sick do we get?
id="t-10239"&&And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is, how sick do we get?
id="t-15658"&&Is it something that we survive?
id="t-17003"&&Is it something that we can treat? 

id="t-18931"&&And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.
id="t-22187"&&And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.
id="t-25673"&&And for a long time, it was the gods, right?
id="t-27630"&&The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me, right?
id="t-27630"&&The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me, right?
id="t-35864"&&And as long as we've looked for explanations, we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science, which is hypotheses as to why we get sick, and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.

id="t-94953"&&So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.
id="t-102630"&&So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.
id="t-109127"&&And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.
id="t-115950"&&But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.
id="t-119326"&&And this is what those people signed up for.
id="t-121285"&&This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba at that time.

id="t-159133"&&It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters, from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.
id="t-169847"&&And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis, experimentation in humans, and informed consent, and you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do the vast majority of medical work.

id="t-184795"&&Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate, so if we're going to look at a new drug, right, we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments, and we gain consent for that study, to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. 

id="t-198743"&&But the world is changing around the clinical study, which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not 50 to 100 years.
id="t-207673"&&So now we're able to gather data about our genomes, but, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.
id="t-213584"&&We're able to gather information about our environment.
id="t-216350"&&And more importantly, we're able to gather information about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies, our genomes, our choices and our environment.
id="t-227469"&&And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person-to-person interaction.

id="t-254733"&&The technology between these two pictures cannot be more different, but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.
id="t-265224"&&We just have better statistics.

id="t-395840"&&It's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it.
id="t-400662"&&And it's an accident.
id="t-403138"&&So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.

id="t-425571"&&So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.
id="t-427729"&&I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.
id="t-430771"&&We can reach back and grab that dust, and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices are part of our health, what we eat is a really important aspect of our health.

id="t-547297"&&So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust, that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype, and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records, and we use it to build something together, which is a commons.
id="t-562114"&&And there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right, here, there, everywhere, right.

id="t-619323"&&And in biology, the numbers are even better.

id="t-638454"&&So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice. 

id="t-642477"&&And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects, is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians, and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
id="t-656090"&&And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age, is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health, while we use hand saws.
id="t-671477"&&If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices, and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices, and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.
id="t-692132"&&Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system that's waiting for data, but there isn't any. 

So that's what I do.
So that's what I do.
id="t-716314"&&So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust, if you reach into your body and grab your genome, if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record, you can actually go through an online informed consent process -- because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research, and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against, so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society. 

id="t-761187"&&And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.

id="t-794600"&&Those are strengths in the system. 

id="t-796951"&&And open doesn't mean that there's no money.
id="t-799616"&&Closed systems, corporations, make a lot of money on the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system.
id="t-811336"&&And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created, so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old, willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk, basically, and you're in.

id="t-920393"&&So what I'd end [with] is, the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job almost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take very many of us to achieve spectacular results.
id="t-933288"&&You just have to be willing to be unreasonable, and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men who got yellow fever ran.
