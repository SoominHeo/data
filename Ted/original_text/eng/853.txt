id="t-86447"&&Somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works.

id="t-136211"&&So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.
id="t-141115"&&If you search Amazon for the word "creativity," you'll discover something like 90,000 books.
id="t-146074"&&If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity," you get 30 million hits.

How is that possible?

id="t-180188"&&We've got to make it happen.
id="t-181544"&&We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.
id="t-184536"&&People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.
id="t-186993"&&However, if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday, if you can imagine this, all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong, what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.
id="t-202933"&&What actually happens is, if I compare this to the average real project, average real successful project, the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi, at a cost of 4,000 pounds, whilst leaving two of the children behind.

id="t-230419"&&This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.
id="t-232993"&&It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty, the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity and the number of bright minds," or something like that.

id="t-298865"&&You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. 

id="t-307232"&&What we do know is that the world has accelerated.
id="t-310010"&&Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.
id="t-312332"&&Technology accelerates things exponentially.

id="t-332117"&&At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.
id="t-334788"&&We've doubled the population in 40 years, put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.

id="t-364261"&&What's happened is, we've changed the scale.
id="t-367175"&&Size and scale are no longer the same.
id="t-370122"&&And then add to that, every time you tweet, over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own.

id="t-513875"&&Now how do we cope and deal with that?
id="t-515574"&&Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.
id="t-519007"&&Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers, because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle, and you believe it will last forever.
