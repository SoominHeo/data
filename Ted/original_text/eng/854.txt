id="t-975"&&In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti, my former professor of art history, and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
id="t-12563"&&Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
id="t-28708"&&Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo. 

id="t-50615"&&Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking, because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
id="t-71115"&&Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling, and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494, and to find out the original doors, windows, and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model, and then, with thermography, we went on to discover hidden windows.

id="t-122415"&&Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap.
id="t-143539"&&One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. 

id="t-156216"&&And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
id="t-165951"&&And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall, an air gap, and that's where we believe "The Battle of Anghiari," or at least the part that we know has been painted, which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located. 

id="t-180252"&&Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt.
id="t-180252"&&Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt.
id="t-189646"&&So I decided to go back to my alma mater, and, at the University of California, San Diego, and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
id="t-199830"&&And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology.
id="t-199830"&&And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology.

id="t-217472"&&We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011, and this time, with a great group of students, and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester, who is now the director at CISA3, and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left.
id="t-237796"&&Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far.

id="t-294306"&&Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind.
id="t-302370"&&As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had, and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named the number one artist influence at the time. 

id="t-317829"&&I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what?

id="t-346866"&&But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
id="t-353545"&&For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
id="t-358161"&&A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
id="t-364310"&&And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately, is not very reliable.

Well, also, authenticity.

id="t-444838"&&But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi."

id="t-472191"&&Well, this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries.

Well, the tablet.

id="t-536099"&&So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet.
id="t-536099"&&So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet.
id="t-548993"&&So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
id="t-553455"&&And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.

id="t-621118"&&This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums.
id="t-599240"&&(Applause) 

id="t-651650"&&Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients, but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately, it's never been tapped as an idea.
id="t-662270"&&Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning, the very first step, to do real conservation, and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation, the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting. 

id="t-685085"&&Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.
id="t-697215"&&We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today. 

id="t-709274"&&And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do.
id="t-715924"&&We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.
id="t-720564"&&As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion, there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us.
