id="t-248"&&I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
id="t-2651"&&I understand we have over 80 countries here, so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. 

id="t-9445"&&In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference.
id="t-13551"&&Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?
id="t-15665"&&Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child, where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.
id="t-23381"&&Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment where my father, who never takes off from work, he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person, going to school to see his son, how he's doing, and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know, John is good at math and art."
id="t-41450"&&And he kind of nodded, you know?
id="t-43512"&&The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-52968"&&And that always stuck with me all my life.
id="t-975359"&&(Applause) As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
id="t-79328"&&It would say you're wrong most of the time.
id="t-80885"&&That was the computer we knew.
id="t-82719"&&That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT, my father's dream.
id="t-82719"&&That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT, my father's dream.
id="t-101282"&&And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago.
id="t-101282"&&And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago.
id="t-108371"&&It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.
id="t-111409"&&I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc., and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
id="t-118875"&&It's a room broken in two halves.
id="t-120840"&&I've turned the computer on, and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
id="t-120840"&&I've turned the computer on, and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
id="t-141496"&&So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer.
id="t-141496"&&So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) And it looks kind of fast.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. 

id="t-171418"&&And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
id="t-173543"&&The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology, design and art, and how they intersect, how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.
id="t-189560"&&And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment. 

id="t-196912"&&So starting from technology, technology is a wonderful thing.
id="t-201882"&&When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
id="t-205406"&&It could show text and after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.
id="t-211474"&&Remember when images were first possible with a computer, those gorgeous, full-color images?
id="t-216352"&&And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
id="t-216352"&&And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
id="t-216352"&&And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
id="t-216352"&&And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
id="t-216352"&&And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
id="t-225859"&&Remember that excitement?
id="t-225859"&&Remember that excitement?
id="t-225859"&&Remember that excitement?
id="t-234556"&&Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet.
id="t-234556"&&Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet.
id="t-244253"&&And then the mobile phone occurred, text, images, audio, video.
id="t-244253"&&And then the mobile phone occurred, text, images, audio, video.
id="t-256782"&&You see this little pattern here?
id="t-258809"&&We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last 10 or so years, and have looked to design, as we understand most things, and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
id="t-275667"&&And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. 

id="t-280423"&&Designers talk about the relationship between form and content, content and form.
id="t-280423"&&Designers talk about the relationship between form and content, content and form.
id="t-286262"&&Well, content is the word up there: fear.
id="t-286262"&&Well, content is the word up there: fear.
id="t-286262"&&Well, content is the word up there: fear.
id="t-293900"&&Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful, and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica, it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?"
id="t-293900"&&Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful, and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica, it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?"
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts.
id="t-310336"&&So you can see how you change the scale, you change the form.
id="t-310336"&&So you can see how you change the scale, you change the form.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-316559"&&You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) Like, we gotta go to Fear.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) It's, like, amazing, right?
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) (Applause) It just changes the same content.
id="t-338978"&&Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart, they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic, and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
id="t-346419"&&You feel for them.
id="t-348604"&&Or you change the typeface to something like this.
id="t-348604"&&Or you change the typeface to something like this.
id="t-348604"&&Or you change the typeface to something like this.
id="t-348604"&&Or you change the typeface to something like this.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear.

id="t-361842"&&If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free.
id="t-361842"&&If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free.
id="t-361842"&&If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free.
id="t-373239"&&Free bold feels like Mandela free.
id="t-375834"&&It's like, yes, I can be free.
id="t-378515"&&Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
id="t-378515"&&Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
id="t-378515"&&Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
id="t-388089"&&And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove, and I have, like, Don Draper free.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
id="t-403728"&&Design does that. 

id="t-406015"&&And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect, and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.
id="t-413920"&&So -- yeah.
id="t-416546"&&So I made a lot of work in the '90s.
id="t-419737"&&This was a square that responds to sound.
id="t-419737"&&This was a square that responds to sound.
id="t-419737"&&This was a square that responds to sound.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah."
id="t-442733"&&We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
id="t-445118"&&And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"
id="t-448290"&&And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
id="t-451833"&&So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. 

id="t-455052"&&And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse.
id="t-455052"&&And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse.

id="t-472522"&&It's called "Tap, Type, Write."
id="t-474188"&&It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
id="t-474188"&&It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
id="t-484280"&&(Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift.
id="t-484280"&&(Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift.
id="t-484280"&&(Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift.
id="t-494047"&&(Typing noises) This is, like, a ring of letters.
id="t-494047"&&(Typing noises) This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a -- Let's see, this is — I love the French film "The Red Balloon."
id="t-494047"&&(Typing noises) This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a -- Let's see, this is — I love the French film "The Red Balloon."

id="t-494047"&&(Typing noises) (Typewriter bell) It's peaceful, like that.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) I'll show this last one.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) I'll show this last one.
id="t-525640"&&It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say, "Hit G, and it's going to be all right.
id="t-541438"&&Thank you.
id="t-975359"&&(Applause) Thank you. 

id="t-544085"&&So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art.
id="t-552059"&&By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
id="t-558068"&&You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
id="t-558068"&&You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
id="t-558068"&&You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
id="t-565260"&&It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say, like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great.
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 

id="t-575644"&&At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab.
id="t-575644"&&At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab.
id="t-584823"&&You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. 

id="t-590707"&&And why do we have this facility?
id="t-593248"&&Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal, the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
id="t-599571"&&At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
id="t-602283"&&And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this?
id="t-602283"&&And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this?
id="t-602283"&&And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this?
id="t-608076"&&And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done.
id="t-608076"&&And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done.
id="t-620086"&&And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa.
id="t-620086"&&And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa.
id="t-620086"&&And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa.
id="t-641213"&&So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
id="t-641213"&&So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) "Tell us more."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) "Tell us more."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) And he saw, over and over, the antique's value was all about it being old.
id="t-657820"&&And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
id="t-657820"&&And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
id="t-657820"&&And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
id="t-667675"&&And he realized, it isn't about old or new.
id="t-670713"&&It's about something in between.
id="t-670713"&&It's about something in between.
id="t-670713"&&It's about something in between.
id="t-677688"&&A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.
id="t-683122"&&You see it in all interesting art today, in all interesting businesses today.
id="t-683122"&&You see it in all interesting art today, in all interesting businesses today.

id="t-691414"&&So art makes questions, and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
id="t-699008"&&We aren't functioning so easily anymore.
id="t-701010"&&We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
id="t-704138"&&As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out.
id="t-704138"&&As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out.
id="t-717262"&&But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people, and it was the best sign ever to say no.
id="t-723309"&&It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
id="t-723309"&&It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
id="t-723309"&&It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
id="t-723309"&&It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
id="t-723309"&&It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
id="t-49677"&&(Laughter) So that is authoritarianism.
id="t-737458"&&And what is that, structurally?
id="t-737458"&&And what is that, structurally?
id="t-737458"&&And what is that, structurally?
id="t-745398"&&It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
id="t-745398"&&It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
id="t-745398"&&It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.

id="t-752136"&&And so today, leaders are faced with how to lead differently, I believe.
id="t-757450"&&This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership.
id="t-757450"&&This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership.
id="t-764345"&&Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.
id="t-768350"&&Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
id="t-772423"&&A traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
id="t-780062"&&And this frame is important today, in this complex, ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe. 

id="t-787330"&&And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox, and I said great.
id="t-795379"&&And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight, six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London, and that was really bad.
id="t-804075"&&But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
id="t-804075"&&But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
id="t-804075"&&But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
id="t-814852"&&And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
id="t-814852"&&And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
id="t-814852"&&And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
id="t-814852"&&And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
id="t-819755"&&And by the end of the experience, I realized why I was doing this.
id="t-824502"&&It's because leaders, what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen, and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London, and so leadership, connecting people, is the great question today.
id="t-841500"&&Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy, it's a wonderful design challenge. 

id="t-846152"&&And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective.
id="t-854519"&&Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.
id="t-858792"&&So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch I wrote in Python.
id="t-858792"&&So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch I wrote in Python.
id="t-863792"&&This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization.
id="t-863792"&&This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization.
id="t-863792"&&This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization.
id="t-873360"&&There may be different subdivisions in the organization, and you might want to look into different areas.
id="t-873360"&&There may be different subdivisions in the organization, and you might want to look into different areas.
id="t-881766"&&You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen?
id="t-881766"&&You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen?
id="t-901938"&&And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D, and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest, and it's a person important to engage.
id="t-915239"&&So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display on how you're interacting with them.
id="t-921874"&&How many coffees do you have?
id="t-923453"&&How often are you calling them, emailing them?
id="t-923453"&&How often are you calling them, emailing them?
id="t-923453"&&How often are you calling them, emailing them?
id="t-929637"&&Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.
id="t-934981"&&You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso, the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis.
id="t-934981"&&You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso, the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis.

id="t-944162"&&So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.
id="t-947615"&&They're targeted social media systems around leaders.
id="t-950473"&&And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design, because art and design lets you think like this, find different systems like this, and I've just begun thinking like this, so I'm glad to share that with you.
id="t-968095"&&So in closing, I want to thank all of you for your attention.
id="t-968095"&&So in closing, I want to thank all of you for your attention.
id="t-975359"&&(Applause) (Applause)
