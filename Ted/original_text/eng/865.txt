id="t-441"&&Two years ago, I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe.
id="t-8988"&&The curator had only one condition: I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.
id="t-14918"&&Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab, or a human being living in the world in 2010, I only had one thing to say: I wanted to say no.
id="t-27446"&&And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no, and a thousand times no."

id="t-31982"&&So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.
id="t-35778"&&on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years, from Spain to the borders of China.
id="t-46186"&&I collected my findings in a book, placed them chronologically, stating the name, the patron, the medium and the date.
id="t-55099"&&Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation, which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany, in September of 2010. 

id="t-65419"&&Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started, and life stopped for 18 days, and on the 12th of February, we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo, believing that the revolution had succeeded. 

id="t-82626"&&Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square.
id="t-82626"&&Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square.
id="t-94241"&&I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street.
id="t-102112"&&So I took one "no" off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it: "no to military rule."
id="t-109690"&&And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
id="t-112706"&&But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book like ammunition, and adding messages to them, and I started spraying them on the walls.
id="t-121106"&&So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you. 

id="t-123812"&&No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator. 

id="t-130316"&&No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution, and he sat there with this guitar, singing.
id="t-139790"&&One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward. 

No to blinding heroes.
No to blinding heroes.

id="t-157688"&&No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion, because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December 16th, during a demonstration, leaving behind three orphans and a widow. 

No to burning books.
No to burning books.

id="t-178924"&&No to stripping the people, and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads, "Long live a peaceful revolution," because we will never retaliate with violence. 

No to barrier walls.
No to barrier walls.

id="t-211719"&&Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo.
id="t-216966"&&A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall.
id="t-216966"&&A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall.
id="t-223115"&&In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head.
id="t-223115"&&In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head.
id="t-232947"&&After acts of violence, another artist came, painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank, demonstrators, and a message that read, "Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face, the face of every martyr.
id="t-232947"&&After acts of violence, another artist came, painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank, demonstrators, and a message that read, "Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face, the face of every martyr.
id="t-251446"&&Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank and adds a message: "Army and people, one hand.
id="t-251446"&&Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank and adds a message: "Army and people, one hand.
id="t-262018"&&Another artist comes, paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank.
id="t-251446"&&Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank, leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster.
id="t-279943"&&So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit, on the tank, and on the whole wall, and this is how it stands today until further notice.
id="t-279943"&&So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit, on the tank, and on the whole wall, and this is how it stands today until further notice.

id="t-290114"&&Now, I want to leave you with a final no.
id="t-294380"&&I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.
id="t-305538"&&The message reads, [Arabic] "You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."

Thank you.
id="t-321264"&&(Applause) (Applause) Thank you.
id="t-321264"&&(Applause) (Applause) Thank you.
