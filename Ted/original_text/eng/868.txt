Other people.
Other people.
id="t-3283"&&Everyone has relationships with other people, and they're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons.
id="t-8853"&&Good relationships, bad relationships, annoying relationships, agnostic relationships, and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship.
id="t-20738"&&So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all interested in interacting with other people, I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features, and I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object, into a scientific probe, and provide the early stages, embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact. 

id="t-43474"&&But before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible.
id="t-47466"&&The first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity.
id="t-52958"&&Without needles and radioactivity, without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
id="t-67797"&&You've probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation.

id="t-84419"&&In the 1990s, it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode, and in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.

id="t-106576"&&You make a blood flow movie, you have an independent proxy of brain activity. 

id="t-110888"&&This has literally revolutionized cognitive science.
id="t-113922"&&Take any cognitive domain you want, memory, motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law, getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on, put people into functional MRI devices, and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.
id="t-128241"&&It's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures, but in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.

id="t-136017"&&That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation.
id="t-136017"&&That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation.
id="t-148224"&&And now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.
id="t-151621"&&We can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings, and we have a few burgeoning biological measures. 

id="t-161167"&&Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do, and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.
id="t-167731"&&Valuation is just what you think it is, you know?
id="t-169866"&&If you went and you were valuing two companies against one another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.
id="t-175406"&&Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.
id="t-179285"&&If you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?
id="t-181975"&&Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
id="t-181975"&&Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
id="t-181975"&&Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
id="t-186586"&&So instead, you convert them to a common currency scale, put them on that scale, and value them accordingly.
id="t-191643"&&Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well, and we're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation, and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.
id="t-208143"&&I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important discovery, and we know a good bit about that now, and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease, and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse, and that makes sense.
id="t-222495"&&Drugs of abuse would come in, and they would change the way you value the world.
id="t-222495"&&Drugs of abuse would come in, and they would change the way you value the world.

Here's the key feature though.
Here's the key feature though.
id="t-243616"&&We have a behavioral superpower in our brain, and it at least in part involves dopamine.
id="t-248058"&&We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea, for a mere idea.
id="t-248058"&&We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea, for a mere idea.
id="t-256252"&&In 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp waiting to take them to the next level.

id="t-270130"&&More than two thirds of them had college degrees.
id="t-273615"&&But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive.
id="t-273615"&&But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive.

id="t-284246"&&One thing that I've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my little talk, and that is other people.
id="t-290728"&&These same valuation systems are redeployed when we're valuing interactions with other people.
id="t-296216"&&So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs, that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease, that contributes to various forms of psychosis, is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you're interacting with somebody else. 

id="t-314478"&&Let me give you an example of this.
id="t-317055"&&You bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it. 

Let me just give you a few examples.

Here's a couple.

id="t-349932"&&Now, the elements of the scene also communicate this to us, but you can read it straight off their faces, and if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.

id="t-388297"&&All right, so what does this mean?
id="t-391094"&&It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.
id="t-394444"&&It engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.

id="t-406708"&&So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?
id="t-413060"&&And the short answer is games.

id="t-427569"&&So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.
id="t-430536"&&Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue.

id="t-468538"&&This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.
id="t-471242"&&That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe.
id="t-471242"&&That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe.
id="t-481231"&&You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.
id="t-484159"&&You have to be able to remember what you've done.
id="t-487372"&&You have to stand up in the moment to do that.
id="t-488792"&&Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back, and you have to do something that is interesting, which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
id="t-497711"&&That is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.
id="t-501044"&&You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.

id="t-522043"&&In doing this, what we've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges.
id="t-526181"&&Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.
id="t-529578"&&When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up, or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system: Hey, get out of the mine.

id="t-542630"&&People come to the table, and even these very blunt, staged social interactions, and they, and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people, and they bring enormous sensitivities to it.
id="t-553789"&&So we realized we could exploit this, and in fact, as we've done that, and we've done this now in many thousands of people, I think on the order of five or six thousand.

id="t-580451"&&Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure, the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.
id="t-587083"&&We can compute that during the game.
id="t-589567"&&And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.

id="t-724453"&&Let me leave you with one thought in closing.
id="t-726794"&&The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited, in a way.
id="t-732468"&&We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously.
id="t-736611"&&The fact is, though, that even when we're alone, we're a profoundly social creature.
