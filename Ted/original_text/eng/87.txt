id="t-1166"&&I've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years, and I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.
id="t-7934"&&I believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
id="t-14335"&&Hungry, extreme poverty: these often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems, too big to solve.
id="t-22006"&&But as a field practitioner, I believe these are actually very solvable problems if we just take the right strategies. 

id="t-30390"&&Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker, and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers, we can move the world.
id="t-36959"&&In the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on.
id="t-42096"&&This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes. 

id="t-47994"&&What is extreme poverty?
id="t-50287"&&When I first moved to rural East Africa, I stayed overnight with a farm family.
id="t-54629"&&They were wonderful people.
id="t-54629"&&They were wonderful people.
id="t-54629"&&They were wonderful people.
id="t-60824"&&They gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.
id="t-63359"&&In the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.
id="t-66265"&&And then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
id="t-74703"&&For that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.
id="t-79575"&&And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt when they handed one of those cups to me, and I knew I had to accept their hospitality. 

id="t-86781"&&Children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.
id="t-91265"&&Every day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.
id="t-95114"&&Amongst the extreme poor, one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.
id="t-102326"&&When that's combined with poor access to health care, one in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.
id="t-109819"&&And only one quarter of children complete high school because they lack school fees.
id="t-113908"&&Hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.
id="t-120771"&&We see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race, but until we solve these problems for all of our members, we fail that standard, because every person on this planet matters.
id="t-132698"&&This child matters.
id="t-135125"&&These children matter.
id="t-137638"&&This girl matters. 

id="t-140209"&&You know, we see things like this, and we're upset by them, but they seem like such big problems.
id="t-145349"&&We don't know how to take effective action.
id="t-148893"&&But remember our friend Archimedes.
id="t-151572"&&Global poverty has powerful levers.
id="t-153924"&&It's a problem like any other.
id="t-156023"&&I live and work in the field, and as a practitioner, I believe these are very solvable problems.
id="t-161320"&&So for the next 10 minutes, let's not be sad about the state of the world.
id="t-165003"&&Let's engage our brains.
id="t-166858"&&Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving and figure out what those levers are. 

id="t-172416"&&Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.
id="t-176157"&&Think about how extraordinary this is.
id="t-178244"&&If this picture represents the world's poor, then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
id="t-184368"&&This gets me really excited.
id="t-186319"&&All of these people, one profession.
id="t-189247"&&Think how powerful this is.
id="t-190727"&&When farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor earn more money and climb out of poverty.
id="t-196697"&&And it gets better.
id="t-197941"&&The product of farming is, of course, food.
id="t-200220"&&So when farmers become more productive, they earn more food, and they don't just help themselves, but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.
id="t-209228"&&And when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.
id="t-213443"&&We only have two ways we can feed the world: we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive, or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland, which would be environmentally disastrous.
id="t-225688"&&Farmers are basically a really important leverage point.
id="t-229496"&&When farmers become more productive, they earn more income, they climb out of poverty, they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.
id="t-238187"&&Farmers stand at the center of the world. 

id="t-242306"&&And not a farmer like this one, but rather this lady.
id="t-246055"&&Most of the farmers I know are actually women.
id="t-248699"&&Look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.
id="t-251995"&&She is physically strong, mentally tough, and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.
id="t-257686"&&If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands, then I'm really glad it's her. 

id="t-262691"&&(Applause) 

id="t-268125"&&There's just one problem: many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
id="t-274748"&&Currently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year, they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
id="t-281864"&&These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age, and it's why many farmers are still very poor. 

id="t-288755"&&But good news, again.
id="t-290161"&&Lever number two: humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.
id="t-296449"&&Let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.
id="t-299944"&&First, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.
id="t-304365"&&If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety together with a drought-resistant variety, you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.
id="t-313390"&&Next, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly, is environmentally sustainable.
id="t-319433"&&If you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that's taller than I am, you unlock enormous yield gain.
id="t-327118"&&These are known as farm inputs.
id="t-329241"&&Farm inputs need to be combined with good practice.
id="t-331865"&&When you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost, farmers multiply their harvests.
id="t-338946"&&These proven tools and practices have more than tripled agricultural productivity in every major region of the world, moving mass numbers of people out of poverty.
id="t-347928"&&We just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

id="t-353925"&&So overall, this is amazing news.
id="t-355671"&&Humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago, in theory.
id="t-360908"&&We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.
id="t-364354"&&In this century, the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in remote places.
id="t-368995"&&They lack access to these things.
id="t-372154"&&Therefore, ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people.
id="t-378185"&&We don't need more genius types right now.
id="t-380507"&&The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime. 

id="t-386088"&&So these are the three levers, and the most powerful lever is simply delivery.
id="t-391033"&&Wherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits set up delivery networks for life-improving goods, we eliminate poverty. 

id="t-400023"&&OK, so that sounds really nice in theory, but what about in practice?
id="t-403354"&&What do these delivery networks look like?
id="t-406006"&&I want to share the concrete example that I know best, my organization, One Acre Fund.
id="t-411165"&&We only serve the farmer, and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.
id="t-416284"&&We start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.
id="t-419262"&&Now, this may appear initially very challenging, but it's pretty possible.
id="t-419262"&&Now, this may appear initially very challenging, but it's pretty possible.
id="t-423787"&&We buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network, and store it in 20 warehouses like this.
id="t-429638"&&Then, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.
id="t-436953"&&They then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.
id="t-440415"&&It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.
id="t-443694"&&Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.
id="t-448536"&&Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.
id="t-453587"&&And then we surround all that with training.
id="t-456151"&&Our rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training to farmers in the field every two weeks. 

id="t-463496"&&Wherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty.
id="t-469193"&&This is a farmer in our program, Consolata.
id="t-472033"&&Look at the pride on her face.
id="t-474212"&&She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet.
id="t-481264"&&Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata. 

id="t-262691"&&(Applause) 

id="t-491881"&&The key to doing this is scalable delivery.
id="t-494482"&&In any given area, we hire a rural field officer who delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average, with more than 1,000 people living in those families.
id="t-503805"&&Today, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers growing very quickly.
id="t-508665"&&This is our delivery army, and we're just one organization.
id="t-512682"&&There are many companies, governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies just like this.
id="t-518105"&&And I believe we stand at a moment in time where collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers. 

id="t-525755"&&Let me show you how possible this is.
id="t-527960"&&This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a map of the United States for scale.
id="t-531982"&&I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory.
id="t-535394"&&It's very challenging.
id="t-537248"&&But we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent, and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.
id="t-547265"&&That's a remarkably small area overall.
id="t-550195"&&If you were to lay these boxes next to each other within a map of the United States, they would only cover the Eastern United States.
id="t-557284"&&You can order pizza anywhere in this territory and it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.
id="t-564581"&&If America can deliver pizza to an area of this size, then Africa's companies, governments and non-profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers.
id="t-573966"&&This is possible. 

id="t-576995"&&I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.
id="t-580292"&&In every field of human development, humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.
id="t-586276"&&We just need to deliver them.
id="t-588322"&&So again, in every area of human development, super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive, highly effective tools.
id="t-595869"&&Humanity is armed to the teeth with simple, effective solutions to poverty.
id="t-601596"&&We just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.
id="t-605266"&&Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
id="t-612440"&&Urban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.
id="t-617282"&&Again, using a map of the United States for scale, this is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.
id="t-624346"&&In fact, for the first time in human history, we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.
id="t-630055"&&The world's companies, governments and non-profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this relatively small area.
id="t-637927"&&We just lack the will. 

id="t-640913"&&If we are willing, every one of us has a role to play.
id="t-645920"&&We first need more people to pursue careers in human development, especially if you live in a developing nation.
id="t-651487"&&We need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers, sales agents for life-improving goods.
id="t-657439"&&These are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others.
id="t-662532"&&But we also need a lot of support roles.
id="t-665731"&&These are roles available at just my organization alone, and we're just one out of many.
id="t-670399"&&This may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty, there is a role for you in this fight.
id="t-677158"&&And no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty, we need a lot more resources.
id="t-682448"&&This is our number one constraint.
id="t-684811"&&For private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital, private equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.
id="t-692477"&&But there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.
id="t-695928"&&Private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor, so philanthropy still has a major role to play.
id="t-702998"&&Anybody can give, but we need more leadership.
id="t-706112"&&We need more visionary philanthropists and global leaders who will take problems in human development and lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet.
id="t-716276"&&If you're interested in these ideas, check out this website. 

id="t-719122"&&We need more leaders.
id="t-722174"&&Humanity has put people on the moon.
id="t-724220"&&We've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet.
id="t-728901"&&We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace.
id="t-732207"&&We are an exceptional people.
id="t-735822"&&But we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
id="t-739485"&&Until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential, we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.
id="t-748516"&&Logistically speaking, it's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty.
id="t-753220"&&We just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody.
id="t-757665"&&If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.
id="t-762024"&&Let's deploy our time, our careers, our collective wealth.
id="t-766781"&&Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime. 

id="t-771971"&&Thank you. 

id="t-262691"&&(Applause)
