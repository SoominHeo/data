id="t-37153"&&Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration, the White House was anything but open.
id="t-45317"&&Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.
id="t-47845"&&We were running Windows 2000.
id="t-50024"&&Social media were blocked at the firewall.
id="t-52207"&&We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today.
id="t-56770"&&I came in to become the head of Open Government, to take the values and the practices of transparency, participation and collaboration, and instill them into the way that we work, to open up government, to work with people. 

id="t-69940"&&Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products, like cars and computers, and the more complex the products are a society creates, the more successful the society is over time.

id="t-110512"&&So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy, what did we do?
id="t-118293"&&Turns out that had never been done before.
id="t-121525"&&We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case, but in advance.

id="t-137267"&&In fact, many people told us it was illegal. 

id="t-140108"&&Here's the crux of the obstacle.
id="t-143221"&&Governments exist to channel the flow of two things, really, values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
id="t-153165"&&But the way that our institutions are designed, in our rather 18th-century, centralized model, is to channel the flow of values through voting, once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year.

id="t-172059"&&Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal, perhaps a little too much. 

id="t-177675"&&Then in the 19th century, we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies.
id="t-185499"&&But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
id="t-185499"&&But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
id="t-185499"&&But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
id="t-193888"&&We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society, and not limited simply to our institutions. 

id="t-204336"&&Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow, that the design of our systems, whether natural or social, channel the flow of whatever runs through them.
id="t-215083"&&So a river is designed to channel the flow of water, and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree, sometimes even having to route around an obstacle, but to get that nutrition flowing.
id="t-232078"&&The same can be said for our social systems, for our systems of government, where, at the very least, flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is, what's really broken, and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today, to redesign the flow of our institutions. 

id="t-249539"&&We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks, and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent.
id="t-261216"&&Think about it: What other business do you know, what other sector of the economy, and especially one as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis?

id="t-323274"&&You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook governing 900 million inhabitants.
id="t-328724"&&We might even call them citizens, because they've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion, and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways.
id="t-340618"&&But private communities, private, corporate, privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
id="t-346550"&&They cannot replace government.
id="t-348560"&&Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance.
id="t-358207"&&But social media do teach us something.

id="t-365619"&&It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways.
id="t-376361"&&We need to think about how to open up the API of government, and the way that we're going to do that, the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution -- because we have to maintain those public values, we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks, all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions, to engage in the practice of governance. 

We have a precedent for this.
We have a precedent for this.
id="t-415927"&&Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power from government to citizens.
id="t-422853"&&Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance. 

id="t-444124"&&Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution, I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.
id="t-456152"&&Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget. 

id="t-483561"&&But it's not just about policing government.
id="t-485959"&&It's also about creating government.
id="t-487686"&&Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding, getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities.
id="t-499709"&&No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services, sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
id="t-509738"&&Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008, this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble, whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti, or more recently in Italy.
id="t-528744"&&And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them. 

id="t-538779"&&Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously, is the opening up of government data, not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data.
id="t-553472"&&There's so many examples I could have picked, and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi.
id="t-553472"&&There's so many examples I could have picked, and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi.
id="t-565689"&&In February, he approached the White House, and said, "I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."
id="t-579274"&&February 2012 to June of 2012, the finalists are announced in the competition.
id="t-585502"&&Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear, getting anything done in a four-month period of time?
id="t-591237"&&You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time, let alone generate real, palpable innovations that improve people's lives. 

id="t-598128"&&And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government, because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today.
id="t-620815"&&In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions, from well-driller to florist.
id="t-626606"&&Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas, but do not make a flower arrangement without a license, because that will land you in jail.

id="t-664053"&&It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development.
id="t-664053"&&It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development.
id="t-674847"&&Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia, largely owned by the Russian government, has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
id="t-685819"&&Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles, from open innovation, and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking, but into the public sector.
id="t-697698"&&And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data, not simply to make apps, but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government. 

id="t-707652"&&So a lot of these innovations are local.
id="t-709782"&&In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack, a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
id="t-726208"&&The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive.
id="t-730977"&&"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan. 

id="t-734652"&&But it's not limited to the local.
id="t-737195"&&British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance. 

id="t-746658"&&Let me be very clear, and perhaps controversial, that open government is not about transparent government.
id="t-755950"&&Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works.
id="t-760280"&&It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change government.
id="t-767828"&&What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information.
id="t-775618"&&And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow of money into politics, and arguably, it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work. 

id="t-790921"&&We're going to see this evolution really in two phases, I think.
id="t-790921"&&We're going to see this evolution really in two phases, I think.
id="t-802117"&&Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started, I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent, and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity.

id="t-840466"&&We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal, complete, and total openness, so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation, beginning this year. 

The second phase of this evolution — Yeah.
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah.
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah.

id="t-865215"&&The first phase is in getting better information in.
id="t-867750"&&The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.

id="t-894496"&&There are many things that we can do to get us there.
id="t-898327"&&Obviously opening up the data is one, but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.
id="t-907583"&&Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate, like the jury is, but we're going to need lots more things like it.
id="t-919514"&&And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
id="t-924165"&&We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino, and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos.
id="t-937253"&&When we start by teaching young people that we live, not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, to change our institutions, that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation, towards this open government movement, towards this open government revolution. 

id="t-960277"&&So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
id="t-968382"&&We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
id="t-971677"&&Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
