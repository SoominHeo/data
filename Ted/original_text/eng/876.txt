id="t-11290"&&Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical, and I think it's something that you can teach.
id="t-17792"&&I think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared, and I think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature, your own cognitive habits, and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully. 

id="t-29852"&&I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big in those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever," and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing.

id="t-42183"&&They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go, to try, to try.
id="t-42183"&&They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go, to try, to try.
id="t-63281"&&And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity to feel that I was able to express my own voice, and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
id="t-71753"&&I feel like I've got something to say and something to share. 

id="t-74769"&&And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body.
id="t-79933"&&I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have, and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them, touch them, help them think differently about things. 

id="t-94881"&&So for me, choreography is very much a process of physical thinking.
id="t-94881"&&So for me, choreography is very much a process of physical thinking.
id="t-104155"&&It's something that I have to do with other people.
id="t-105981"&&You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.
id="t-108735"&&I work often with designers and visual artists, obviously dancers and other choreographers, but also, more and more, with economists, anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, people really who come from very different domains of expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process. 

id="t-130766"&&What I thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking, and we're all experts in physical thinking.
id="t-138031"&&Yeah, you all have a body, right?
id="t-139409"&&And we all know what that body is like in the real world, so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception, the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
id="t-149273"&&So, we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms, yeah?
id="t-156009"&&You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup, or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.
id="t-160734"&&So we're experts in physical thinking already.
id="t-162692"&&We just don't think about our bodies very much.
id="t-164728"&&We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack, then you become really very aware of your bodies.
id="t-172536"&&But how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally? 

id="t-180589"&&What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.
id="t-183545"&&I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.
id="t-185848"&&I'll just be doing it.
id="t-187823"&&I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something. 

I want to introduce you.
I want to introduce you.
I want to introduce you.

id="t-194670"&&(Applause) 

id="t-197518"&&They have no idea what we're going to do.
id="t-200122"&&So this is not the type of choreography where I already have in mind what I'm going to make, where I've fixed the routine in my head and I'm just going to teach it to them, and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.
id="t-211250"&&That's not the methodology at all that we work with.
id="t-214184"&&But what's important about it is how it is that they're grasping information, how they're taking information, how they're using it, and how they're thinking with it. 

id="t-222695"&&I'm going to start really, really simply.
id="t-224143"&&Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it, it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something very simply, where you take one idea from a body, and it happens to be my body, and translate that into somebody else's body, so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy. 

id="t-242912"&&And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like, that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in the real world.
id="t-242912"&&And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like, that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in the real world.

id="t-256114"&&I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
id="t-256114"&&I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
id="t-256114"&&I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
id="t-256114"&&I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
id="t-266925"&&So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
id="t-266925"&&So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.

id="t-266925"&&So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
id="t-274098"&&It gives me something to do, something to work towards.
id="t-277106"&&If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor, all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee, yeah?
id="t-277106"&&If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor, all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee, yeah?

id="t-289744"&&So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something, and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it, they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory and they're holding onto memory?

id="t-304422"&&And we'll see what we come up with.
id="t-305826"&&So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're accessing this and what they're doing, and I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E," and the letter "D," to make something.

So I have to get myself in the zone.
So I have to get myself in the zone.

id="t-331877"&&It's a bit of a cross of my arm. 

id="t-340438"&&So all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T" and flashing through it with some action.
id="t-350404"&&I'm not remembering what I'm doing.
id="t-350404"&&I'm not remembering what I'm doing.
id="t-350404"&&I'm not remembering what I'm doing.
id="t-360947"&&Strike moment.
id="t-362817"&&That's it. 

id="t-367789"&&So we're starting to build a phrase. 

id="t-372131"&&So what they're doing, let's see, something like that, so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they're generating it into a phrase.
id="t-379136"&&You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
id="t-381394"&&I'm not asking them to copy exactly.
id="t-383684"&&They're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase.
id="t-389357"&&I can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they're moving.
id="t-394031"&&Yeah, they're super quick, right? 

id="t-397111"&&So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it into something that's physical.
id="t-405616"&&Some dancers, when they're watching action, take the overall shape, the arc of the movement, the kinetic sense of the movement, and use that for memory.
id="t-414375"&&Some work very much in specific detail.
id="t-416658"&&They start with small little units and build it up.
id="t-416658"&&They start with small little units and build it up.
id="t-416658"&&They start with small little units and build it up.

id="t-438012"&&So they're solving this problem for me, having a little -- They're constructing that phrase.
id="t-446854"&&They have something and they're going to hold on to it, yeah?
id="t-446854"&&They have something and they're going to hold on to it, yeah?
id="t-450353"&&That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. 

Okay.
Okay.
id="t-454683"&&So basically I'm going to make a duet.
id="t-457399"&&I want you to think about them as architectural objects, so what they are, are just pure lines.
id="t-463190"&&They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?
id="t-469971"&&So what I'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them: If, then; if, then.
