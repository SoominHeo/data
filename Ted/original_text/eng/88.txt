id="t-3825"&&I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female, like all of you.
id="t-7455"&&And I'm also a social justice comedian, something that I insist is an actual job. 

id="t-12127"&&To explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here.
id="t-14818"&&I've performed all over the country.
id="t-16597"&&And let me tell you, America is majestic, right?
id="t-18918"&&It's got breathtaking nature, waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see.
id="t-23848"&&It is really something. 

id="t-25784"&&Now, the American population can be broken up into three main categories: there's mostly wonderful people, haters and Florida. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-35331"&&Besides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters.
id="t-38669"&&They are a minority, but they overcompensate by being extra loud.
id="t-43409"&&They have the Napoleon complex of demographics, and yes, some of the men do wear heels. 

id="t-47834"&&As a social justice comedian, it's my goal to convert these haters, because they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes, like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.
id="t-59400"&&This is not an exhaustive list; I'm probably missing 3-7 items. 

id="t-63004"&&But the point is, we have to reckon with the haters.
id="t-66003"&&But there's variance within this group and it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?
id="t-70883"&&So what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
id="t-74420"&&I basically took all of the haters, I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist, and this is what I found. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-81695"&&First off, we have the trolls.
id="t-84013"&&These are your garden-variety digital haters.
id="t-86420"&&They're the people who quit their jobs so they can post on YouTube videos all day long.
id="t-91448"&&There's also the drive-by haters.
id="t-94133"&&Now, these people will be at a stoplight, they'll wait for the light to turn green and when it does, they yell, "Go back to your own country!"
id="t-101288"&&Now back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars and hated you to your face.
id="t-105845"&&But they just don't make them like they used to -- which is another sign of the decline in America. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-112293"&&The next category is the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation- gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.
id="t-117827"&&These guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization, like a church or a nonprofit, and they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice. 

id="t-126324"&&But the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.
id="t-130888"&&The swing hater is sister to the swing voter -- they just can't decide!
id="t-136252"&&They're like ideological sluts who move from hating to not hating.
id="t-140168"&&And they do it because they don't have enough information.
id="t-142947"&&This is the group I like to target with social justice comedy.
id="t-145949"&&Why comedy?
id="t-147283"&&Because on a scale of comedy to brochure, the average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-154733"&&Comedy is very popular.
id="t-156117"&&And by the way, this is a mathematically accurate graph, generated from fake numbers. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-162311"&&Now, the question is: Why does social justice comedy work?
id="t-166329"&&Because, first off, it makes you laugh.
id="t-169052"&&And when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.
id="t-172238"&&And in that moment of openness, a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information, and if they're really skilled, a rectal exam. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-182794"&&Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy: first off, it's not partisan.
id="t-188002"&&This isn't political comedy, this is about justice, and no one is against justice.
id="t-192288"&&Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
id="t-197090"&&Three, it's funny but sneaky, like you could be hearing an interesting treatise on income inequality, that's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-208158"&&Here's how I see social justice comedy working.
id="t-211205"&&A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians -- in a non-violent way -- 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-217265"&&And we went around the country to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia -- places where they love the Muzzies -- and we did stand-up shows.
id="t-226657"&&We called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-231284"&&We turned this into a movie, and then after the movie came out, a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars on an anti-Muslim poster campaign with the MTA -- that's the New York City subway system.
id="t-243729"&&Now, the posters were truly offensive, not to mentioned poorly designed -- I mean, if you're going to be bigoted, you might as well use a better font. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-252043"&&But we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign that says nice things about Muslims, while promoting the movie.
id="t-259188"&&So myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah decided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign.
id="t-264857"&&We raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months, got the posters approved, and two days after they were supposed to go up, the MTA decided to ban the posters, citing political content. 

id="t-277900"&&Let's take a look at a couple of those posters.
id="t-280157"&&Here's one.
id="t-281475"&&Facts about Muslims: Muslims invented the concept of a hospital.
id="t-284834"&&OK.
id="t-286009"&&Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-291603"&&Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-295578"&&Let's take a look at another one.
id="t-297484"&&The ugly truth about Muslims: they have great frittata recipes. 

id="t-301549"&&Now clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.
id="t-306080"&&Either that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political -- but it isn't.
id="t-311609"&&It's about justice.
id="t-312886"&&So we decided to change our fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-321863"&&So basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians took on a major New York City agency and the comedians won. 

id="t-328970"&&(Applause and cheers) 

id="t-331570"&&Thank you.
id="t-332745"&&Victory was a very weird feeling.
id="t-334492"&&I was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time?
id="t-337452"&&'Cause this is amazing!"

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-341702"&&Here's another example.
id="t-343999"&&I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
id="t-343999"&&I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
id="t-343999"&&I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
id="t-349467"&&So I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com.
id="t-352137"&&It's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week, while taking the weekends off.
id="t-356626"&&Let's take a look at an example.
id="t-359008"&&They generally appear as single-panel cartoons, "I denounce terrorism!
id="t-359008"&&They generally appear as single-panel cartoons, "I denounce terrorism!
id="t-365872"&&The point of the website is that it denounces terrorism while recognizing that it's ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism. 

id="t-373656"&&But if bigotry isn't your thing, social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.
id="t-379346"&&For example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp went to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.
id="t-385750"&&Now, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens.
id="t-392528"&&Not to brag, but at the end of every month, I have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income.
id="t-397966"&&So we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents. 

id="t-33724"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-406539"&&The bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
id="t-411994"&&Security would come out, brandish their weapons, and then we would squeal with fear and run away, because -- and this is the last rule of social justice comedy -- sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants. 

id="t-423175"&&Most of my work is meant to be fun.
id="t-426046"&&It's meant to generate a connection and laughter.
id="t-429157"&&But yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security.
id="t-432513"&&Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.
id="t-435504"&&Sometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes, they'll kill me and they'll kill my family.
id="t-443489"&&And those death threats are definitely not funny. 

id="t-447287"&&But despite the occasional danger, I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons.
id="t-453369"&&I mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing.
id="t-458994"&&But still, a lot of things are still kind of awful.
id="t-463265"&&So I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke. 

id="t-331570"&&Thank you. 

id="t-468208"&&(Applause)
