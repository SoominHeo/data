id="t-11235"&&Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer, presumably because it appeals to my well-known and abundant narcissism.

id="t-31734"&&So, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose, and that is that I'm really bored with music, and I'm really bored with the role of the composer, and so I decided to put that idea, boredom, as the focus of my presentation to you today.
id="t-46067"&&And I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story, tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention, and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline, and how boredom also, in a sense, pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional, narrow definition of a composer. 

id="t-70908"&&What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) Okay, I wrote that.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) Okay, I wrote that.
id="t-90743"&&No, no, I didn't write that.
id="t-92374"&&In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven, and so I was not functioning as a composer.
id="t-97201"&&Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter, and there I am, interpreter.
id="t-97201"&&Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter, and there I am, interpreter.
id="t-97201"&&Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter, and there I am, interpreter.
id="t-105022"&&But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"
id="t-109229"&&And I say this rhetorically, because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is, of course, a piece of music, but I put this here now because, just to set it in your brains for the moment, because we're going to return to this question.
id="t-122228"&&It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. 

id="t-125821"&&So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven, and my problem with it is, it's boring.
id="t-131255"&&I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like -- (Laughter) It's Beethoven, how can you say that?
id="t-139793"&&No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
id="t-139793"&&No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
id="t-139793"&&No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.

id="t-190754"&&So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.
id="t-193866"&&(Applause) That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
id="t-193866"&&(Applause) That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
id="t-193866"&&(Applause) That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
id="t-193866"&&(Applause) That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
id="t-210707"&&I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.
id="t-224454"&&So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there, and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.

id="t-256256"&&It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon I go through other instruments, they become familiar, and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument, and I brought one with me today, and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like. 

id="t-76207"&&(Music) 

You gotta have doorstops, that's important.

You gotta have doorstops, that's important.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) They're all mounted on my instruments.

I can actually do all sorts of things.

I can actually do all sorts of things.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) And with a bank of live electronics, I can change the sounds radically.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) (Music) Like that, and like this.
id="t-76207"&&(Music) And so forth. 

id="t-341410"&&So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about — This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter) and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.

(Laughter) and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.
id="t-193866"&&(Applause) So in that regard, this is one of the things, this is one of the privileges of being, and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way, when I told you that I'm the world's greatest, if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.

id="t-380398"&&Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.
id="t-385945"&&I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player, and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.

id="t-399307"&&Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises, and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.
id="t-415755"&&I get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person, sometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people, and this is probably the capacity, the role creatively for which I'm probably best known professionally.
id="t-428991"&&Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this, and others look like this, and some look like this, and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.
id="t-439169"&&It takes a long, long time to make these scores, and right now I'm working on a piece that's 180 pages in length, and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.

id="t-452403"&&So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me, so after a while the process of notating is not only boring, but I actually want the notation to be more interesting, and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. 

id="t-464791"&&This is an excerpt from a score called "The Metaphysics of Notation."
id="t-469212"&&The full score is 72 feet wide.
id="t-471756"&&It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.
id="t-471756"&&It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.

id="t-513611"&&Now this was a really exciting experience for me.
id="t-517295"&&It was gratifying musically, but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum, and that is as visual artist.

id="t-532269"&&So one of the things is that, I mean, some people would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante," and maybe that's true.
id="t-532269"&&So one of the things is that, I mean, some people would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante," and maybe that's true.

I can understand the question, though.
I can understand the question, though.
id="t-552195"&&I mean, there's not any traditional notation.
id="t-554454"&&I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.
id="t-560079"&&I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations, and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches, follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour. 

id="t-570830"&&So this is a case of actually adapting something, or maybe stealing something, and then turning it into a musical notation. 

id="t-578115"&&Another adaptation would be this piece.
id="t-580270"&&I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.
id="t-583616"&&I made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them, and the players follow these scores.
id="t-589092"&&They follow the second hands, and as they pass over the various symbols, the players respond musically.
id="t-594099"&&Here's another example from another piece, and then its realization. 

id="t-598376"&&So in these two capacities, I've been scavenger, in the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right, or thief maybe, and I've also been designer, in the case of making the wristwatches.
id="t-608075"&&And once again, this is, for me, interesting. 

id="t-611655"&&Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.
id="t-614974"&&Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements, and I often perform them.
id="t-614974"&&Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements, and I often perform them.
id="t-621579"&&This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter, who is an extraordinary performer.
id="t-625955"&&Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation. 

id="t-76207"&&(Music) 

id="t-658275"&&Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp, the intonation was a little questionable.

This is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players.
This is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players.

id="t-702327"&&This was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language, which produced no decibels to speak of, but affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience. 

id="t-712053"&&So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors, people might, you know, wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"

id="t-725599"&&But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself, and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."
id="t-731933"&&You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.

id="t-808800"&&There was the florist, and I can understand that, once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally, but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you. 

id="t-821009"&&This is going to be a piece called "Aphasia," and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound, and this invites yet another role, and final one I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.
id="t-832421"&&And the score for the piece looks like this, and it instructs me, the performer, to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples.
id="t-847170"&&I recorded an awesome singer, and I took the sound of his voice in my computer, and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you're about to hear.

id="t-911254"&&I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question, that this is not the important question.

id="t-923899"&&I allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me, and I don't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion, some paradigm, of what music composition is supposed to be, and that has actually urged me, in a sense, to take on a whole bunch of different roles, and so what I want you to think about is, to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline, and, okay, I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here, because, like, I realized I mentioned some psychological defects earlier, and we also, along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior, and there was some delusional behavior and things like that, and here I think we could say that this is an argument for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia, at least in the popular use of the term, and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay.
