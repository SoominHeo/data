id="t-516"&&I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.
id="t-4623"&&And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well.
id="t-9047"&&When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes, I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
id="t-19655"&&I'm not connecting to them.
id="t-21263"&&Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up.
id="t-26767"&&I'm suffering from gallery fatigue. 

id="t-29951"&&How many of you out there suffer from -- yes.
id="t-29951"&&How many of you out there suffer from -- yes.
id="t-34332"&&Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it.
id="t-34332"&&Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it.
id="t-42871"&&For me, I look at the paintings on the wall and I think, somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it.
id="t-52759"&&In fact, most of the time I don't see it. 

id="t-55423"&&And I leave feeling actually unhappy.
id="t-59197"&&I feel guilty and unhappy with myself, rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting, I think there's something wrong with me.
id="t-66184"&&And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that. 

id="t-69092"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-70363"&&The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.
id="t-72672"&&If you think about going into a restaurant, when you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?
id="t-72672"&&If you think about going into a restaurant, when you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?
id="t-72672"&&If you think about going into a restaurant, when you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?
id="t-82884"&&If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?
id="t-82884"&&If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?
id="t-82884"&&If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?
id="t-94491"&&How come, then, it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery?
id="t-99685"&&Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting? 

id="t-102980"&&Well I'm trying to take a different approach.
id="t-105684"&&And there's two things I do: When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other.
id="t-119085"&&I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.
id="t-127061"&&So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
id="t-127061"&&So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
id="t-127061"&&So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
id="t-132821"&&And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting, and I tell myself a story about it. 

Why a story?
Why a story?
id="t-147077"&&We tell stories all the time about everything, and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place, and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it.
id="t-160677"&&Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?
id="t-164668"&&So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries. 

id="t-171606"&&There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them.
id="t-180424"&&The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter.
id="t-189162"&&This is the most glorious painting.
id="t-191662"&&I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster.
id="t-191662"&&I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster.
id="t-200243"&&It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone, I never tire of looking at her. 

id="t-205737"&&What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face.
id="t-214017"&&But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing, and that is the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.
id="t-223551"&&I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time.
id="t-228936"&&So that keeps me coming back. 

id="t-232535"&&One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall, I lay in bed and looked at her, and I suddenly thought, I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that.
id="t-245723"&&And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him.
id="t-253606"&&Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.
id="t-256762"&&Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.
id="t-261531"&&And I thought, well, what is that relationship? 

So I went to find out.
So I went to find out.
id="t-269896"&&In fact, we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are, and we know very little about Vermeer himself.
id="t-276730"&&Which made me go, "Yippee!"
id="t-279504"&&I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to. 

id="t-284163"&&So here's how I came up with the story.
id="t-286759"&&First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house.
id="t-290728"&&How does Vermeer know her?
id="t-293216"&&Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter.
id="t-299183"&&The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
id="t-301408"&&And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look, but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.
id="t-306288"&&For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time, if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
id="t-311720"&&It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that. 

id="t-315504"&&So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him.
id="t-319634"&&Well, who else would be in the house?
id="t-321898"&&A servant, a lovely servant.
id="t-325281"&&So, she's in the house.
id="t-326842"&&How do we get her into the studio?
id="t-329503"&&We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio.
id="t-329503"&&We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio.
id="t-343323"&&It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
id="t-346400"&&And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before, you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet. 

id="t-353208"&&How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?
id="t-357104"&&Well, he compartmentalizes his life.
id="t-359400"&&He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
id="t-359400"&&He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
id="t-359400"&&He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
id="t-359400"&&He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
id="t-359400"&&He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
id="t-374859"&&And he decides to paint her. 

id="t-376939"&&He has her wear very plain clothes.
id="t-379207"&&Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.
id="t-388544"&&This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring.
id="t-393104"&&Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.
id="t-393104"&&Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.
id="t-393104"&&Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.
id="t-402020"&&We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.
id="t-407061"&&Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings, different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.
id="t-419232"&&So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
id="t-423710"&&It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife. 

id="t-429813"&&So we've got all the elements for our story.
id="t-432990"&&She's in the studio with him for a long time.
id="t-435420"&&These paintings took a long time to make.
id="t-437463"&&They would have spent the time alone, all that time.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-440334"&&She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
id="t-447941"&&And if she doesn't, well -- that's the story. 

id="t-69092"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-455351"&&The next painting I'm going to talk about is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.
id="t-461188"&&He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people.
id="t-468157"&&And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
id="t-476084"&&I like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right. 

id="t-485893"&&He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
id="t-489884"&&He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
id="t-489884"&&He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
id="t-489884"&&He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
id="t-502877"&&The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.
id="t-502877"&&The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.
id="t-502877"&&The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.
id="t-502877"&&The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.
id="t-502877"&&The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.
id="t-524874"&&And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.
id="t-532744"&&He's never going to look at me. 

id="t-534265"&&So I was thinking of a story where, if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?
id="t-539160"&&Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.
id="t-541362"&&I'm thinking of an older version of himself.
id="t-543888"&&He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me.
id="t-543888"&&He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me.
id="t-543888"&&He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me.
id="t-554754"&&And he never does. 

id="t-556280"&&And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad.
id="t-562127"&&I've written an entire novel about her, and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
id="t-565776"&&Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
id="t-572561"&&And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again. 

id="t-581823"&&The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.
id="t-69092"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-589225"&&This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
id="t-592276"&&They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is. 

id="t-599153"&&Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.
id="t-604689"&&They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
id="t-607113"&&So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage, along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings. 

id="t-616672"&&This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons: One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.
id="t-627257"&&He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?
id="t-630264"&&The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.
id="t-630264"&&The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.
id="t-630264"&&The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.
id="t-639304"&&This must be a guy who blushes all the time.
id="t-642338"&&What is he thinking about that's making him blush?
id="t-644480"&&The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
id="t-651056"&&Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.
id="t-654624"&&And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed. 

id="t-661048"&&I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks, and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him, and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?
id="t-669072"&&And I thought, if I'm going to make a story, what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?
id="t-673328"&&Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?
id="t-676958"&&And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.
id="t-678888"&&He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.
id="t-683032"&&Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
id="t-686681"&&You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
id="t-693915"&&Now, here's the story.
id="t-698636"&&It's short. 

id="t-701566"&&"Rosy" 

id="t-704297"&&I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.
id="t-708347"&&It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread, set close together so that the fit is snug.
id="t-718760"&&The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
id="t-722323"&&Perhaps that was the intention.
id="t-726073"&&I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.
id="t-730991"&&I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed.
id="t-735386"&&I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion, from wine, from high emotion. 

id="t-741442"&&As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys, but not by George.
id="t-748354"&&Only George could call me Rosy.
id="t-751428"&&I would not allow anyone else.
id="t-753587"&&He managed to make the word tender.
id="t-757811"&&When I made the announcement, George did not turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.
id="t-763674"&&He should not have been surprised.
id="t-765578"&&It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin.
id="t-771098"&&But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.
id="t-773682"&&I know, I could barely utter them. 

id="t-776983"&&Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
id="t-781385"&&Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.
id="t-786642"&&We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
id="t-786642"&&We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
id="t-786642"&&We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.

He glanced at me.
He glanced at me.

id="t-798573"&&"We will still see each other," I insisted.
id="t-800577"&&"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.
id="t-803865"&&Nothing need change."
id="t-805601"&&George did not speak.
id="t-805601"&&George did not speak.
id="t-805601"&&George did not speak.
id="t-805601"&&George did not speak.

id="t-816817"&&George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
id="t-820398"&&"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.
id="t-824481"&&I'm sure you'll be content together."
id="t-829317"&&He never used my nickname again. 

id="t-832634"&&Thank you. 

id="t-834393"&&(Applause) 

id="t-832634"&&Thank you. 

id="t-834393"&&(Applause)
