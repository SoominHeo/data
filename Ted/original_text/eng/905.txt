id="t-1012"&&Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so I've never seen color, and I don't know what color looks like, because I come from a grayscale world.
id="t-15272"&&To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white. 

id="t-21986"&&But, since the age of 21, instead of seeing color, I can hear color.
id="t-28408"&&In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona, is this electronic eye.
id="t-44485"&&It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction.
id="t-58663"&&(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like — This is the sound of purple.

id="t-84480"&&So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time.
id="t-93651"&&At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception.
id="t-104360"&&I didn't have to think about the notes.
id="t-106119"&&And after some time, this perception became a feeling.
id="t-108744"&&I started to have favorite colors, and I started to dream in colors. 

id="t-112524"&&So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds.
id="t-112524"&&So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds.
id="t-128522"&&It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.
id="t-133762"&&It had become a part of my body, an extension of my senses, and after some time, it even became a part of my official image. 

id="t-144795"&&This is my passport from 2004.
id="t-147141"&&You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment, but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body, an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo. 

id="t-163974"&&So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color, because color is almost everywhere, so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso, for example.

id="t-182505"&&And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking, it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.
id="t-187916"&&It's like going to a nightclub.
id="t-187916"&&It's like going to a nightclub.
id="t-187916"&&It's like going to a nightclub.
id="t-192660"&&Especially the aisle with cleaning products.
id="t-192660"&&Especially the aisle with cleaning products.
id="t-192660"&&Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

id="t-198086"&&Also, the way I dress has changed.
id="t-200558"&&Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
id="t-200558"&&Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
id="t-200558"&&Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

id="t-207543"&&(Applause) 

id="t-212674"&&So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.
id="t-212674"&&So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.
id="t-212674"&&So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.

id="t-231692"&&Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song.
id="t-231692"&&Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song.
id="t-246424"&&So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters.
id="t-246424"&&So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters.
id="t-255150"&&And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts, that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs. 

id="t-267692"&&Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed, because when I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.
id="t-281824"&&(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite, the other way around.
id="t-281824"&&(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite, the other way around.
id="t-287562"&&Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.
id="t-296904"&&Here's some faces. 

id="t-298641"&&(Musical chords) 

Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good.
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good.

id="t-316601"&&Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.
id="t-319650"&&Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.
id="t-322448"&&They have similar sound of eyes. 

id="t-324585"&&So you relate people that you wouldn't relate, and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces.
id="t-332786"&&So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.
id="t-335882"&&The good thing about this is, if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
id="t-340353"&&It's not my fault, because — (Laughter) 

id="t-342624"&&And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color.
id="t-353138"&&I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green.
id="t-359225"&&The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise, and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience, 

id="t-365650"&&so I started to paint music and paint people's voices, because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. 

id="t-373896"&&And here's some music translated into color.
id="t-379015"&&For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.
id="t-384215"&&(Music) Very yellow and very colorful, because there's many different frequencies.
id="t-388217"&&(Music) And this is a completely different song.
id="t-388217"&&(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby."
id="t-388217"&&(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby."

id="t-403689"&&So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color, for example, these are two very well-known speeches.
id="t-414400"&&One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream," and the other one is Hitler.
id="t-419589"&&And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels, and then I ask people, "Which one do you prefer?"
id="t-427488"&&And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. 

id="t-435784"&&So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors, just like human vision.
id="t-443108"&&I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
id="t-446703"&&But then, I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough.
id="t-452024"&&There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but that electronic eyes can perceive.
id="t-457828"&&So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. 

id="t-471389"&&For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.
id="t-478904"&&I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.
id="t-482357"&&And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe, because ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive. 

id="t-499574"&&That's why, two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. 

id="t-512577"&&We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses, so if we extend our senses, we will consequently extend our knowledge.
id="t-521544"&&I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body.
id="t-530962"&&I think this will be a big, big change that we will see during this century. 

id="t-534856"&&So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend.
id="t-540190"&&I would encourage you to become a cyborg.
id="t-540190"&&I would encourage you to become a cyborg.
id="t-540190"&&I would encourage you to become a cyborg.
id="t-207543"&&(Applause)
