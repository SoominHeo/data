id="t-1086"&&About 75 years ago, my grandfather, a young man, walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that, and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen: none other than Mae West, the heartthrob of the '30s, and he could never forget her.
id="t-21267"&&In fact, when he had his daughter many years later, he wanted to name her after Mae West, but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West?
id="t-29915"&&The Indian family said, no way! 

id="t-31601"&&So when my twin brother Kaesava was born, he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name.
id="t-38764"&&He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E, why can't Keshava be K-A-E?
id="t-46011"&&So he changed Kaesava's spelling.
id="t-48251"&&Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago.
id="t-52522"&&He decided to spell, or, rather, misspell Raehan with an A-E. 

id="t-56833"&&You know, my grandfather died many years ago when I was little, but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny.

id="t-69560"&&You know, as for me, my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project.
id="t-74037"&&We actually sit every few years, argue, disagree, fight, and actually come up with our very own 200-year plan. 

id="t-82460"&&Our friends think we're mad.
id="t-84420"&&Our parents think we're cuckoo.
id="t-85908"&&Because, you know, we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom, but we both like to live larger than life.
id="t-94581"&&I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before you can become an ascetic.
id="t-100165"&&This is me being a rock star, even if it's in my own house.
id="t-103284"&&You know? 

id="t-104548"&&So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago, we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves.
id="t-113620"&&What do we mean by beyond ourselves? 

id="t-116284"&&Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world.
id="t-122652"&&There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years, so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. 

id="t-133060"&&You know, I never really believed in legacy.
id="t-133060"&&You know, I never really believed in legacy.
id="t-133060"&&You know, I never really believed in legacy.
id="t-138284"&&Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.
id="t-141570"&&It caused so much trouble for me.
id="t-144218"&&I was so upset.
id="t-145634"&&You know, a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. 

id="t-153010"&&Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me, and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. 

id="t-162905"&&You know, the 9/11 cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again.
id="t-169729"&&I said, I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. 

id="t-172858"&&But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw, because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. 

id="t-181684"&&You know, sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic.
id="t-186249"&&Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. 

id="t-192298"&&One of the most important things in my 200-year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves.
id="t-199756"&&You know, we carry so much baggage, from our parents, from our society, from so many people -- fears, insecurities -- and our 200-year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire.
id="t-213245"&&We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems.
id="t-217220"&&The latest date I put was, I said, I am going to expire my fear of my leftist, feminist mother-in-law, and this today is the date!
id="t-217220"&&The latest date I put was, I said, I am going to expire my fear of my leftist, feminist mother-in-law, and this today is the date!
id="t-477032"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-231511"&&Anyway, you know, I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself, and that's the most important kind of decisions I make.
id="t-244735"&&And this directly translates into my paintings.
id="t-247930"&&But like my friends, I can do that really well on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.
id="t-253567"&&Name it, I'm on it.
id="t-255000"&&I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world, you know?
id="t-255000"&&I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world, you know?
id="t-261208"&&It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory, but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology.
id="t-269236"&&We only remember what we want to.
id="t-269236"&&We only remember what we want to.
id="t-272031"&&And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know?
id="t-272031"&&And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know?

id="t-283229"&&Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our 200-year plan to really curate our digital legacy. 

id="t-292332"&&That is a picture of my mother, and she recently got a Facebook account.
id="t-298102"&&You know where this is going.
id="t-299868"&&And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.
id="t-477032"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-305652"&&And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone.
id="t-305652"&&And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone.
id="t-305652"&&And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone.
id="t-305652"&&And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone.
id="t-305652"&&And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone.

id="t-320973"&&Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves.
id="t-326468"&&Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. 

id="t-330268"&&You know, whether you agree with, you know, legacy or not, we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time.
id="t-338469"&&So Netra and I really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy, and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. 

id="t-350132"&&How, you may ask? 

id="t-351965"&&Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time.
id="t-351965"&&Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time.
id="t-361829"&&I can actually visualize my future approaching.
id="t-364580"&&I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want.
id="t-368181"&&It's like a video game obstacle course.
id="t-368181"&&It's like a video game obstacle course.
id="t-368181"&&It's like a video game obstacle course.
id="t-382985"&&Are they feeling it from their heart, or is it just a cerebral thing?
id="t-386884"&&And it really informs my painting.
id="t-388992"&&Even when I do an art show, I really think about, what should people walk away with? 

id="t-392759"&&I remember when I was 19, I did, I wanted to do my first art exhibition, and I wanted the whole world to know about it.
id="t-402439"&&I didn't know TED then, but what I did was I closed my eyes tight, and I started dreaming.
id="t-402439"&&I didn't know TED then, but what I did was I closed my eyes tight, and I started dreaming.
id="t-421736"&&And I woke up from my visualization and I said, who was that?
id="t-421736"&&And I woke up from my visualization and I said, who was that?

id="t-433087"&&As it turned out, next morning I wrote a letter to both of them, and Shabana Azmi replied, and came and launched my very first show 12 years ago.
id="t-443952"&&And what a bang it started my career with!
id="t-443952"&&And what a bang it started my career with!
id="t-456236"&&This is a picture of my family, and that is Netra, my wife.
id="t-461063"&&She's the co-creator of my 200-year plan. 

id="t-464176"&&Netra's a high school history teacher.
id="t-464176"&&Netra's a high school history teacher.
id="t-469976"&&I keep saying, "Nets, you live in the past while I'll create the future, and when I'm done, you can study about it."
id="t-477032"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-478992"&&She gave me an indulgent smile, and as punishment, she said, "Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history, and you are sitting in it, and I'm grading you."

I'm like, "Oh, God."
I'm like, "Oh, God."

id="t-490815"&&I actually went and sat in on her class.
id="t-490815"&&I actually went and sat in on her class.
id="t-490815"&&I actually went and sat in on her class.
id="t-505567"&&I said, "Wow," again.
id="t-508359"&&Then she said, "Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity."

id="t-518311"&&History as an imaging tool?
id="t-521566"&&I was so inspired. 

id="t-523199"&&I went and created my own version of Indian history.
id="t-526136"&&I actually included stories from my grandmother.
id="t-529045"&&She used to work for the telephone exchange, and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.
id="t-535068"&&And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard.
id="t-535068"&&And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard.
id="t-541451"&&This is my version of Indian history. 

id="t-544245"&&You know, if this is so, it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity.
id="t-557347"&&Go tell Facebook to figure that out! 

id="t-560664"&&Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years.
id="t-560664"&&Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years.
id="t-560664"&&Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years.
id="t-573947"&&We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. 

id="t-578084"&&You know, I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy.
id="t-586262"&&Education is great.
id="t-587786"&&It really teaches us who we are, and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world, but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. 

id="t-600083"&&I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have.
id="t-606298"&&It lets us create who we are, and curate what is to come. 

id="t-610395"&&I like to think -- Thank you. 

id="t-613635"&&I like to think of myself as a storyteller, where my past and my future are only stories, my stories, waiting to be told and retold.
id="t-613635"&&I like to think of myself as a storyteller, where my past and my future are only stories, my stories, waiting to be told and retold.

Shukran!
