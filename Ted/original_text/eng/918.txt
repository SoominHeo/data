id="t-908"&&I'd like to talk about my dad.
id="t-2500"&&My dad has Alzheimer's disease.
id="t-5076"&&He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
id="t-5076"&&He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
id="t-5076"&&He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
id="t-24100"&&My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. 

My dad's not alone.
My dad's not alone.
id="t-43926"&&That's a lot of people.
id="t-43926"&&That's a lot of people.
id="t-43926"&&That's a lot of people.
id="t-56540"&&And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."
id="t-65740"&&Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
id="t-74189"&&I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. 

id="t-79940"&&Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.
id="t-85500"&&I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active, that's what the research says you should do.
id="t-93724"&&But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.
id="t-98212"&&If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
id="t-101724"&&That's what happened with my dad.
id="t-101724"&&That's what happened with my dad.
id="t-101724"&&That's what happened with my dad.
id="t-110012"&&(Laughter) He got dementia anyway.
id="t-98212"&&If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
id="t-118573"&&Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.
id="t-124333"&&So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. 

id="t-128082"&&Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father, and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation: I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength, and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.

id="t-153764"&&You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.
id="t-157900"&&It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.
id="t-162188"&&And reading is just about impossible.
id="t-164812"&&When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.
id="t-173772"&&With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
id="t-178284"&&He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.
id="t-183789"&&He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
id="t-190819"&&But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
id="t-190819"&&But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
id="t-190819"&&But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
id="t-200308"&&Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
id="t-204564"&&Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?
id="t-207668"&&So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
id="t-211868"&&I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
id="t-211868"&&I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
id="t-211868"&&I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
id="t-110012"&&(Laughter) And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob. 

But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it.
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it.
id="t-236668"&&Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.
id="t-245150"&&They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
id="t-254652"&&That all seems like win to me.
id="t-257164"&&I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
id="t-260187"&&A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms.
id="t-260187"&&A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms.
id="t-260187"&&A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms.
id="t-260187"&&A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms.
id="t-277124"&&So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
id="t-280564"&&I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile.
id="t-287207"&&I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around. 

Finally, the third thing.
Finally, the third thing.
id="t-300879"&&My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.
id="t-305646"&&I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills, but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons, he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.
id="t-318717"&&And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.
id="t-323422"&&even when it's so hard.
id="t-324806"&&When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines.
id="t-330398"&&I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.
id="t-334317"&&And what I need now is to learn to be like that.
id="t-337365"&&I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive. 

id="t-342838"&&I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
id="t-345357"&&What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.
id="t-349221"&&But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.
id="t-352671"&&Thank you. 

id="t-354421"&&(Applause)
