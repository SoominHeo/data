id="t-1206"&&I'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories.
id="t-6767"&&Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time.
id="t-14184"&&Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes.
id="t-21547"&&But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
id="t-25551"&&What if a photograph could actually collapse time, compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image? 

id="t-35395"&&I've created a concept called "Day to Night" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.
id="t-41308"&&I know it has for me. 

id="t-43260"&&My process begins by photographing iconic locations, places that are part of what I call our collective memory.
id="t-51570"&&I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
id="t-55024"&&I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.
id="t-59981"&&Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night. 

id="t-69600"&&Using time as a guide, I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time.
id="t-79431"&&I can take you to Paris for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
id="t-84342"&&And I can show you the early morning rowers along the River Seine.
id="t-88554"&&And simultaneously, I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
id="t-93820"&&And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light. 

id="t-99885"&&I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air, and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day. 

id="t-110549"&&Day to Night is a global project, and my work has always been about history.
id="t-115975"&&I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice and actually seeing it during a specific event.
id="t-121993"&&And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata, an event that's actually been taking place since 1498.
id="t-129906"&&The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
id="t-134821"&&And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is: this is not a timelapse, this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
id="t-145181"&&I am a relentless collector of magical moments.
id="t-148848"&&And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them. 

id="t-156227"&&The entire concept came about in 1996.
id="t-160893"&&LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
id="t-170710"&&I got to the set and realized: it's a square.
id="t-174111"&&So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images.
id="t-181391"&&So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.
id="t-184973"&&And as I pan my camera to the right, I noticed there was a mirror on the wall and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
id="t-192848"&&And for that one moment, that one image I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?"
id="t-198085"&&And then I came back to my studio in New York, and I hand-glued these 250 images together and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
id="t-207694"&&I'm changing time in a photograph."
id="t-210422"&&And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years until technology finally has caught up to my dreams. 

id="t-219401"&&This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
id="t-222880"&&And I'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures.
id="t-229330"&&To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this, most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane.
id="t-237718"&&So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop capturing the entire day unfold. 

id="t-244290"&&One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
id="t-247290"&&And trust me when I tell you, this is the greatest seat in the house to have. 

id="t-252226"&&But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
id="t-255785"&&So once I decide on my view and the location, I have to decide where day begins and night ends.
id="t-262704"&&And that's what I call the time vector.
id="t-265476"&&Einstein described time as a fabric.
id="t-269257"&&Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity.
id="t-274924"&&I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane. 

id="t-283095"&&One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
id="t-295249"&&I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph. 

id="t-301114"&&Now when I do these pictures, it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
id="t-306750"&&I build a photograph based on time, and this is what I call the master plate.
id="t-311766"&&This can take us several months to complete.
id="t-315126"&&The fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs.
id="t-323218"&&So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control.
id="t-328543"&&It's at the end of the process, if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same, that I then decide who's in and who's out, and it's all based on time.
id="t-337809"&&I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.
id="t-346168"&&I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds. 

id="t-355268"&&Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt, the great Hudson River School painter.
id="t-363723"&&He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
id="t-367120"&&This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
id="t-370347"&&So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
id="t-373427"&&This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic.
id="t-379592"&&I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
id="t-382371"&&I was literally on the side of a cliff, capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions, the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
id="t-390988"&&And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
id="t-395641"&&The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night. 

id="t-406072"&&And on a personal note, I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
id="t-411783"&&And when that sun started to rise in the valley, I started to literally shake with excitement because I looked at the painting and I go, "Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier."

id="t-425757"&&Day to Night is about all the things, it's like a compilation of all the things I love about the medium of photography.
id="t-433071"&&It's about landscape, it's about street photography, it's about color, it's about architecture, perspective, scale -- and, especially, history. 

id="t-442371"&&This is one of the most historical moments I've been able to photograph, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.
id="t-449682"&&And if you look closely in this picture, you can actually see time changing in those large television sets.
id="t-455901"&&You can see Michelle waiting with the children, the president now greets the crowd, he takes his oath, and now he's speaking to the people.
id="t-464698"&&There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.
id="t-469096"&&For this particular photograph, I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air and it was not very stable.
id="t-476050"&&So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight, our horizon line shifted.
id="t-480804"&&So for every picture you see, and there were about 1,800 in this picture, we both had to tape our feet into position every time I clicked the shutter.
id="t-490010"&&(Applause) 

id="t-494202"&&I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.
id="t-498868"&&I think the two most important are patience and the power of observation.
id="t-504958"&&When you photograph a city like New York from above, I discovered that those people in cars that I sort of live with everyday, they don't look like people in cars anymore.
id="t-514936"&&They feel like a giant school of fish, it was a form of emergent behavior.
id="t-520063"&&And when people describe the energy of New York, I think this photograph begins to really capture that.
id="t-526260"&&When you look closer in my work, you can see there's stories going on.
id="t-530235"&&You realize that Times Square is a canyon, it's shadow and it's sunlight.
id="t-535883"&&So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.
id="t-539105"&&So wherever the shadows are, it's night and wherever the sun is, it's actually day. 

id="t-544453"&&Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around.
id="t-549940"&&But in a very unique and special way, I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.
id="t-556703"&&They embody a new metaphysical visual reality.
id="t-562996"&&When you spend 15 hours looking at a place, you're going to see things a little differently than if you or I walked up with our camera, took a picture, and then walked away. 

id="t-573175"&&This was a perfect example.
id="t-575175"&&I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."
id="t-577667"&&I watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
id="t-582041"&&They were more interested in using it as a backdrop.
id="t-585106"&&They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away.
id="t-590089"&&And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example, a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into.
id="t-603922"&&The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself.
id="t-490010"&&(Applause) 

id="t-614681"&&And finally, my most recent image, which has such a special meaning for me personally: this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
id="t-624925"&&And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera, this is not a reserve.
id="t-629532"&&I went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.
id="t-636503"&&Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a drought going on during the peak migration, a five-week drought.
id="t-641886"&&So all the animals were drawn to the water.
id="t-644503"&&I found this one watering hole, and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving, I had a real opportunity to capture something unique. 

id="t-654325"&&We spent three days studying it, and nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed during our shoot day.
id="t-660438"&&I photographed for 26 hours in a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.
id="t-667340"&&What I witnessed was unimaginable.
id="t-669920"&&Frankly, it was Biblical.
id="t-671491"&&We saw, for 26 hours, all these competitive species share a single resource called water.
id="t-679115"&&The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years.
id="t-685301"&&The animals never even grunted at each other.
id="t-689515"&&They seem to understand something that we humans don't.
id="t-693650"&&That this precious resource called water is something we all have to share. 

id="t-699699"&&When I created this picture, I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph. 

id="t-714809"&&As technology evolves along with photography, photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory, but they will compose a new narrative of untold stories, creating a timeless window into our world. 

id="t-735285"&&Thank you. 

id="t-490010"&&(Applause)
