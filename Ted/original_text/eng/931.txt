So, that's what I've done with my life.
So, that's what I've done with my life.
id="t-65731"&&(Applause) 

id="t-85382"&&As a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida, and I did what most little kids do.
id="t-89788"&&I played a little baseball, did a few other things like that, but I always had the sense of being an outsider, and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate, I thought, "Wow, that's for me," you know?
id="t-102520"&&Because there was no coach standing directly over you, and these guys, they were just being themselves.
id="t-106858"&&There was no opponent directly across from you.
id="t-109253"&&And I loved that sense, so I started skating when I was about 10 years old, in 1977, and when I did, I picked it up pretty quickly.
id="t-118925"&&In fact, here's some footage from about 1984.
id="t-122829"&&It wasn't until '79 I won my first amateur championship, and then, by '81, I was 14, and I won my first world championship, which was amazing to me, and in a very real sense, that was the first real victory I had. 

id="t-139410"&&Oh, watch this.
id="t-140234"&&This is a casper slide, where the board's upside down.
id="t-140234"&&This is a casper slide, where the board's upside down.

id="t-150700"&&So, as she mentioned, that is overstated for sure, but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating.
id="t-158788"&&Here's some images of that. 

id="t-165748"&&Now, I was about halfway through my pro career in, I would say, the mid-'80s.
id="t-172439"&&Freestyle itself, we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw, but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding, where guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie, like I showed you?

id="t-191905"&&So it was evolving upwards.
id="t-194178"&&In fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today, they pretty much mean a street skater, because freestyle, it took about five years for it to die, and at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which, phew!

id="t-218732"&&That's how you make your money, you know?
id="t-219843"&&You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes.
id="t-219843"&&You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes.

id="t-227108"&&The crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it, because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.
id="t-227108"&&The crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it, because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.
id="t-235698"&&Champion sounds so goofy, but it's what it was, right?
id="t-238334"&&And I got to -- What drew me to skateboarding, the freedom was now restored, where I could just create things, because that's where the joy was for me, always, was creating new stuff.
id="t-249935"&&The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks.
id="t-255792"&&Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different. 

id="t-258850"&&So, as humbling and rotten as it was — And believe me, it was rotten.
id="t-258850"&&So, as humbling and rotten as it was — And believe me, it was rotten.
id="t-258850"&&So, as humbling and rotten as it was — And believe me, it was rotten.

id="t-258850"&&So, as humbling and rotten as it was — And believe me, it was rotten.

id="t-277245"&&So, humbling as it was, I began again.
id="t-279909"&&Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) And again, there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me — Oh, that one?
id="t-290570"&&That's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
id="t-290570"&&That's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
id="t-290570"&&That's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
id="t-295656"&&See how it's sliding on the backside?
id="t-295656"&&See how it's sliding on the backside?
id="t-295656"&&See how it's sliding on the backside?
id="t-302200"&&You know, at the very root of that, see, caspers, see how you throw it?
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) Simple as that, right?
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) Simple as that, right?
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) Simple as that, right?

id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) Simple as that, right?
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) Simple as that, right?
id="t-328254"&&It's just the way you throw your board over.
id="t-330474"&&Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy, and the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks based out of the variations. 

id="t-336361"&&So that's the kind of thing that, here, check this out, here's another way, and I won't overdo this.
id="t-340884"&&A little indulgent, I understand.
id="t-343107"&&There's something called a primo slide.
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) It is the funnest trick ever to do.
id="t-345576"&&(Skateboard noises) It's like skinboarding. 

id="t-356179"&&And this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way?
id="t-359060"&&Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way.
id="t-359060"&&Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way.

id="t-391515"&&And so the night before my surgery, I'd watched, and I was like, "How am I going to do this?"
id="t-394984"&&So I ran up, and I jumped on my board, and I cavemanned, and I flipped it down, and I remember thinking, I landed so light-footed, thinking, if my knee gives, they'll just have more work to do in the morning.
id="t-405883"&&(Laughs) (Laughter) 

id="t-407524"&&And so, when it was the crazy thing.
id="t-409982"&&I don't know how many of you guys have had surgery, but -- (Laughter) -- you are so helpless, right?
id="t-415309"&&You're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by, every time it's always that, and right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep, all I was thinking is, "Man, when I wake up and I get better, the first thing I'm going to do is film that trick."

id="t-433962"&&Now, let me -- I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks.
id="t-433962"&&Now, let me -- I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks.
id="t-439869"&&What we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks.

id="t-439869"&&What we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks.
id="t-462130"&&How can I expand, how can the context, how can the environment change the very nature of what I do?
id="t-467904"&&So you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I gotta admit, just because I was struggling with this because I'm here, but I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you, not only to be here in front of you, but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus, because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.

id="t-490483"&&So let me give you another example of how context shapes content.
id="t-496243"&&This is a place not that far from here.

id="t-496243"&&This is a place not that far from here.
id="t-496243"&&This is a place not that far from here.
id="t-504004"&&It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right?
id="t-510282"&&But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies, so check this out.
id="t-510282"&&But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies, so check this out.
id="t-519203"&&Freestyle oriented, manual down -- wheelie down.

id="t-519203"&&Freestyle oriented, manual down -- wheelie down.

id="t-527052"&&This one, a little sketchy going backwards, and watch the back foot, watch the back foot.

id="t-549423"&&And another example of how the context changed, and the creative process for me and for most skaters, is, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security, you check for stuff.
id="t-549423"&&And another example of how the context changed, and the creative process for me and for most skaters, is, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security, you check for stuff.
id="t-570632"&&No matter how good you are, right, you still gotta deal with — So you hit this wall, and when I hit it, the first thing you do is you fall forward, and I'm like, all right, all right.
id="t-579485"&&As you adjust, you punch it up, and then when I would do that, it was throwing my shoulder this way, which as I was doing it, I was like, "Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip," because that's how you load up for a 360 flip. 

id="t-595626"&&And so this is what I want to emphasize that, as you can imagine, all of these tricks are made of sub-movements, executive motor functions, more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you, but one thing I do know is, every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements.

id="t-622463"&&And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around, and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent, and that's when the cognitive mind, you think, "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."
id="t-631653"&&So that's how that works to me, the creative process, the process itself of street skating. 

So, next — Oh, mind you.
So, next — Oh, mind you.
id="t-639705"&&These are some of the best skaters in the world.
id="t-639705"&&These are some of the best skaters in the world.

id="t-646080"&&And the beauty of skateboarding is that, no one guy is the best.
id="t-657607"&&What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves.
id="t-663681"&&Every single one of these guys, you look at them, you can see a silhouette of them, and you realize, like, "Oh, that's him, that's Haslam, that's Koston, there's these guys, these are the guys. 

id="t-674001"&&And skaters, I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging, but belonging on their own terms, and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do, these basic tricks, 360 flips, we take that, we make it our own, and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself.
id="t-699804"&&The greater the contribution, the more we express and form our individuality, which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with.
id="t-710699"&&The summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual.

id="t-828719"&&I've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company, and it grew, and it became the biggest, and then it went down, and then it became the biggest again, which is harder than the first time, and then we sold it, and then we sold it again.
