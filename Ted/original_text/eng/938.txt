id="t-312"&&I collaborate with bacteria.
id="t-2450"&&And I'm about to show you some stop-motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. 

id="t-11230"&&So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing, and as they do so they create an electrical charge.
id="t-17618"&&And this attracts metals from their local environment.
id="t-22118"&&And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria. 

id="t-26952"&&One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water.
id="t-34036"&&And the desalination process is one where we take out salts.
id="t-37486"&&We can use it for drinking and agriculture.
id="t-40001"&&Removing the salts from water -- particularly seawater -- through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe. 

id="t-50620"&&So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology.
id="t-54251"&&We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure.
id="t-58352"&&And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane.
id="t-62576"&&This takes energy, producing clean water.
id="t-66543"&&But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine. 

id="t-70244"&&But the process is very expensive and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.
id="t-74291"&&And also, the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.
id="t-78957"&&And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. 

id="t-83940"&&So I work in Singapore at the moment, and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology.
id="t-90724"&&And Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water.
id="t-98206"&&But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine.
id="t-103309"&&And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. 

id="t-106507"&&So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium, potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine.
id="t-115340"&&And this, in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned, equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources. 

id="t-128071"&&So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before; imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine.
id="t-147092"&&And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube, a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. 

id="t-154342"&&Thank you.
