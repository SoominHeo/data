id="t-1037"&&Well, I work at the SETI Institute.
id="t-1037"&&Well, I work at the SETI Institute.
id="t-1037"&&Well, I work at the SETI Institute.
id="t-7658"&&In other words, I look for aliens, and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.
id="t-15706"&&I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate. 

id="t-18039"&&Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic, ridiculous, maybe even hopeless, but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay, and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work, if that's what you call it.
id="t-35021"&&This thing — whoops, can we go back?
id="t-38029"&&Hello, come in, Earth.
id="t-38029"&&Hello, come in, Earth.
id="t-38029"&&Hello, come in, Earth.

id="t-42079"&&This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968, I was working there collecting data for my thesis.
id="t-50417"&&Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data, so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself, because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid within about 30 miles.
id="t-66034"&&So here are pictures of myself.
id="t-68043"&&The observatory had just acquired a new book, written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded and translated and edited by a little-known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. 

id="t-82061"&&And I remember reading that book, and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate, to send bits of information from one star system to another.
id="t-98610"&&Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone, haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea, but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute.
id="t-98610"&&Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone, haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea, but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute.
id="t-132023"&&So it was true. 

All right.
All right.
id="t-137031"&&The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
id="t-150004"&&Now, Frank didn't hear anything.
id="t-151600"&&Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force, which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
id="t-156974"&&But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed, we have been doing SETI ever since, not continuously, but ever since. 

id="t-169502"&&We still haven't heard anything.
id="t-169502"&&We still haven't heard anything.
id="t-173066"&&In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth, but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact, the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better.
id="t-184068"&&This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles from whatever seat you're in right now.
id="t-189021"&&This is something that we're using today to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten very much better too.
id="t-194500"&&This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.
id="t-197026"&&This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.
id="t-199047"&&Some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960, 100 trillion times better.
id="t-211534"&&That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card, okay?
id="t-216030"&&But something that's not appreciated by the public is, in fact, that the experiment continues to get better, and, consequently, tends to get faster.
id="t-224037"&&This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot, you lose 10 percent of the audience.
id="t-224037"&&This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot, you lose 10 percent of the audience.
id="t-224037"&&This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot, you lose 10 percent of the audience.
id="t-236647"&&In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
id="t-236647"&&In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
id="t-236647"&&In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
id="t-241042"&&But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader, because of this increase in speed.
id="t-248016"&&In fact, those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent, will note that this is a semi-log plot.
id="t-254089"&&In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
id="t-254089"&&In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
id="t-254089"&&In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
id="t-254089"&&In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
id="t-263533"&&They don't really know what exponential means, but this is exponential.
id="t-267081"&&In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course, every card-carrying member of the digerati knows that that's Moore's Law. 

id="t-273497"&&So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems, a million star systems, looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there.
id="t-283547"&&Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?
id="t-286045"&&I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?
id="t-289059"&&And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.
id="t-289059"&&And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

id="t-308084"&&So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy, just in our galaxy, by the way, and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our telescopes. 

id="t-324040"&&That's a lot of real estate, but of course, most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless, like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.
id="t-329564"&&Neptune's probably not very big in your life.
id="t-331654"&&So the question is, what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life?
id="t-337683"&&We don't know the answer to that either, but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project, the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand, one in a hundred, something like that.
id="t-357876"&&Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's one in a thousand, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy.
id="t-367383"&&Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here, but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know, keep that in mind.
id="t-367383"&&Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here, but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know, keep that in mind.

id="t-393040"&&All right, so the bottom line is this: Because of the increase in speed, and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.
id="t-405050"&&And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you: Either we're going to find E.T.
id="t-405050"&&And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you: Either we're going to find E.T.

id="t-420320"&&Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about, and that is, what happens?
id="t-420320"&&Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about, and that is, what happens?
id="t-430039"&&I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.
id="t-432404"&&Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company.
id="t-432404"&&Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company.
id="t-432404"&&Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company.
id="t-440051"&&Now, I might be at ground zero for this. 

id="t-442015"&&I happen to know what the consequence for me would be, because we've had false alarms.
id="t-442015"&&I happen to know what the consequence for me would be, because we've had false alarms.

id="t-459814"&&I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call, somebody to call, the government to call.

id="t-475005"&&Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night, the phone rings and it's The New York Times.
id="t-481406"&&And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings.

But what about you?
But what about you?
id="t-501050"&&And the answer is that we don't know the answer.
id="t-503057"&&We don't know what that's going to do to you, not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.
id="t-507066"&&I mean, that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris, you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to, what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case?"
id="t-523071"&&And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood, but it probably wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict what finding E.T.
id="t-523071"&&And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood, but it probably wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict what finding E.T.
id="t-533685"&&But here are a couple things I can say.
id="t-535307"&&To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.
id="t-539464"&&You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.
id="t-541088"&&They're not building transmitters.
id="t-542378"&&They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand anything that they're going to say, then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own.
id="t-558050"&&Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen, and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know, giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress.
id="t-569603"&&It would change his day, all right? 

That's one thing.
That's one thing.
id="t-577553"&&We will know that we're not that miracle, right, that we're just another duck in a row, we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn.
id="t-588002"&&We're not a miracle, okay? 

id="t-591103"&&The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague, but I think interesting and important, and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society, because they will be, that will tell you something about our own possibilities, that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.
id="t-608295"&&Because they survived their technology, we could do it too.
id="t-611203"&&Normally when you look out into the universe, you're looking back in time.
id="t-611203"&&Normally when you look out into the universe, you're looking back in time.
id="t-615555"&&That's interesting to cosmologists.
id="t-617594"&&But in this sense, you actually can look into the future, hazily, but you can look into the future.
id="t-623053"&&So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection. 

id="t-628590"&&Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime, and that is, SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.
id="t-642464"&&Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers.
id="t-642464"&&Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers.
id="t-642464"&&Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers.
id="t-657345"&&And they're just doing it because they want to explore, and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity," but that's not frivolous.
id="t-657345"&&And they're just doing it because they want to explore, and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity," but that's not frivolous.
id="t-667059"&&You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants, maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.
id="t-676175"&&They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.
id="t-678076"&&You gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something.
id="t-681658"&&But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out, those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive.
id="t-681658"&&But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out, those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive.

id="t-690929"&&I also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what I think is a critical lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy, the lack of the ability to even understand science.
id="t-706023"&&Now, look, a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country.
id="t-711463"&&You've heard about it.
id="t-714015"&&Well, here's one example, in fact.
id="t-716067"&&Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
id="t-718386"&&It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them out there, but they're here, right?
id="t-724097"&&Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.
id="t-729512"&&Well, that would be interesting if it was true, and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is very good.
id="t-729512"&&Well, that would be interesting if it was true, and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is very good.

id="t-738036"&&But there are other things that people believe that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy, or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution, all that sort of thing, or global warming.
id="t-752604"&&These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity, that you can't trust the scientists. 

id="t-758080"&&Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's a critically important problem, and you might say, "Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"
id="t-767030"&&Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem, but it can address the problem.
id="t-771092"&&It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science.
id="t-771092"&&It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science.
id="t-785021"&&I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library, if you could find the library, right?
id="t-795025"&&In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home.
id="t-795025"&&In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home.
id="t-795025"&&In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home.
id="t-806488"&&Now, that's not true anymore.
id="t-808081"&&Today, you've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are.
id="t-808081"&&Today, you've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are.
id="t-808081"&&Today, you've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are.

id="t-818058"&&And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson, finding the Higgs boson.
id="t-822276"&&Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets, "Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
id="t-829055"&&And I bet the answer you're going to get, is, "Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is, and I don't know if it's important."
id="t-834265"&&And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc, okay?
id="t-838511"&&And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
id="t-838511"&&And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
id="t-838511"&&And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
id="t-845070"&&SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.
id="t-846687"&&We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to try to eavesdrop on signals.
id="t-846687"&&We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to try to eavesdrop on signals.
id="t-851055"&&Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated, but everybody gets the idea. 

So that's one thing.
So that's one thing.
id="t-859008"&&It's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings, and I think that's part of our hardwiring.
id="t-865071"&&I mean, we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be, if you will, competitors, or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates.
id="t-865071"&&I mean, we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be, if you will, competitors, or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates.
id="t-873015"&&I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth.
id="t-873015"&&I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth.
id="t-877047"&&We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.
id="t-884754"&&You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.
id="t-887088"&&It's mostly about things that have big teeth.
id="t-889144"&&Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
id="t-889144"&&Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
id="t-889144"&&Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
id="t-896026"&&This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science, obviously biology, obviously astronomy, but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of, "We're looking for E.T."
id="t-913338"&&So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact, it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults, you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.
id="t-923701"&&But if you give talks to kids, you know, one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think, "Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go, you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.
id="t-934368"&&They get interested in something. 

id="t-936050"&&Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal, personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless, that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and 11.
id="t-936050"&&Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal, personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless, that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and 11.
id="t-948056"&&So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try and make 10 percent of the talks that I give, I try and make those for kids.
id="t-955078"&&I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually, it was actually my junior high school.
id="t-955078"&&I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually, it was actually my junior high school.

id="t-978067"&&And so I got interested in electronics, and you know, I studied to get my ham license.
id="t-978067"&&And so I got interested in electronics, and you know, I studied to get my ham license.
id="t-983044"&&Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

id="t-983044"&&Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.
id="t-987605"&&So that's my point, that you can have a big effect on these kids. 

id="t-992033"&&In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds that had come to this talk.
id="t-1002005"&&I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.
id="t-1004521"&&Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle looking up at me with big eyes, and I started, there was a white board behind me, and I started off by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said, "All right, now look, this is the number of stars in the visible universe, and this number is so big there's not even a name for it."
id="t-1022116"&&And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said, "Well, actually there is a name for it.
