id="t-2430"&&This sound, this smell, this sight all remind me of the campfires of my childhood, when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.
id="t-24617"&&There was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.
id="t-32106"&&It was dreaming time. 

id="t-36087"&&Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming, although I'm known to make my dreams come true.
id="t-43134"&&Last year, I created a one-man show.
id="t-46425"&&For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity, how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible. 

id="t-57759"&&And then TED challenged me: "Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"
id="t-63273"&&(Laughter) Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.
id="t-68190"&&But here I am.
id="t-70453"&&One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable, every second will have its importance and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.
id="t-76781"&&No, no, no.
id="t-78199"&&No, the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.
id="t-84749"&&So please join me for a minute of silence. 

id="t-106026"&&Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.
id="t-108186"&&But hey, we're on TED time. 

id="t-110904"&&When I was six years old, I fell in love with magic.
id="t-115759"&&For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation.
id="t-122633"&&Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box.
id="t-130019"&&So I looked in the book for the most difficult move, and it was this. 

id="t-136907"&&Now I'm not supposed to share that with you, but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.
id="t-144097"&&Now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages.
id="t-153174"&&One, two, three, four, five, six and seven.
id="t-159383"&&And let me show you something else.
id="t-160984"&&The cards were bigger than my hands. 

id="t-171433"&&Two months later, six years old, I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
id="t-177295"&&And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"
id="t-182161"&&Six years old.
id="t-183501"&&The magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.
id="t-186883"&&You cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing.
id="t-193234"&&For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect."
id="t-202840"&&Two years later, one -- zoop.
id="t-202840"&&Two years later, one -- zoop.
id="t-202840"&&Two years later, one -- zoop.
id="t-202840"&&Two years later, one -- zoop.

id="t-215270"&&Passion is the motto of all my actions.
id="t-223831"&&As I'm studying magic, juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.
id="t-235226"&&Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly.
id="t-235226"&&Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly.
id="t-235226"&&Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly.

id="t-245703"&&I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe, and he agrees to sell me three clubs.
id="t-245703"&&I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe, and he agrees to sell me three clubs.
id="t-245703"&&I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe, and he agrees to sell me three clubs.
id="t-256109"&&Nothing to do with golf.
id="t-257625"&&They are those beautiful oblong objects, but quite difficult to make.
id="t-263759"&&They have to be precisely lathed.
id="t-265625"&&Oh, when I was buying the clubs, somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.
id="t-270942"&&Well I didn't think much of it at the time. 

id="t-273292"&&Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.
id="t-277258"&&But I could not understand.
id="t-279594"&&I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.
id="t-283360"&&The clubs were escaping me at each throw.
id="t-286542"&&And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.
id="t-289559"&&Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn, the world's greatest juggler.
id="t-295860"&&And he was frowning.
id="t-297375"&&And he finally asked, "Can I see those?"
id="t-299792"&&So I proudly showed him my clubs.
id="t-302158"&&He said, "Philippe, you have been had.
id="t-302158"&&He said, "Philippe, you have been had.
id="t-302158"&&He said, "Philippe, you have been had.
id="t-307976"&&They are impossible to juggle."
id="t-313127"&&Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds. 

id="t-321374"&&So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers, and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.
id="t-327408"&&It was more interesting; I heard.
id="t-329326"&&I heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air -- the high-wire walkers.
id="t-337234"&&Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood, so that's it.
id="t-337234"&&Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood, so that's it.

id="t-345619"&&I found two trees -- but not any kind of trees, trees with character -- and then a very long rope.
id="t-356496"&&And I put the rope around and around and around and around and around till I had no more rope.
id="t-360746"&&Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.
id="t-363263"&&I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers, and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.
id="t-371215"&&So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
id="t-371215"&&So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
id="t-371215"&&So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
id="t-378311"&&So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes. 

id="t-385333"&&Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.
id="t-389344"&&So I cut one rope off.
id="t-391387"&&And the next day one rope off.
id="t-393132"&&And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.
id="t-397931"&&Now you can imagine at that time I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.
id="t-404165"&&So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try -- this is how not to learn wire walking. 

id="t-63273"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-414116"&&Intuition is a tool essential in my life.
id="t-422648"&&In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers, I am my own teacher, progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler. 

id="t-436099"&&On the high wire, within months, I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus, except I am not satisfied. 

id="t-444015"&&I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.
id="t-452276"&&But nobody wanted to hire me.
id="t-454980"&&So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.
id="t-460399"&&Notre Dame, the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the World Trade Center.
id="t-471417"&&And I developed a certitude, a faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.
id="t-477250"&&If not, I will never do that first step. 

id="t-480002"&&Well nonetheless, on the top of the World Trade Center my first step was terrifying.
id="t-493111"&&All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.
id="t-497384"&&Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.
id="t-500220"&&The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel.
id="t-500220"&&The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel.
id="t-500220"&&The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel.
id="t-510099"&&I step over the beam.
id="t-511831"&&I put my left foot on the cable, the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building.
id="t-521878"&&Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?
id="t-525697"&&My right leg will be unburdened, my right foot will freely meet the wire.
id="t-531717"&&On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.
id="t-536289"&&On the other, the universe of the clouds, so full of unknown we think it's empty.
id="t-542582"&&At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.
id="t-548797"&&It's a straight line, which sags, which sways, which vibrates, which rolls on itself, which is ice, which is three tons tight, ready to explode, ready to swallow me.
id="t-565981"&&An inner howl assails me, the wild longing to flee.
id="t-571964"&&But it is too late.
id="t-574431"&&The wire is ready.
id="t-577081"&&Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable. 

id="t-589718"&&Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary. 

id="t-596243"&&So after the walk people ask me, "How can you top that?"
id="t-599313"&&Well I didn't have that problem.
id="t-601618"&&I was not interested in collecting the gigantic, in breaking records.
id="t-606302"&&In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks -- or some completely different type of performance.
id="t-619797"&&Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example. 

id="t-625959"&&So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character I created 45 years ago, I am as happy as when I am in the clouds. 

id="t-642463"&&But this here, this is not the street.
id="t-646749"&&So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.
id="t-649325"&&So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?
id="t-651498"&&You know that, right?
id="t-652864"&&You don't want me to juggle, right? 

id="t-655113"&&(Applause) 

id="t-663335"&&(Music) 

id="t-655113"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1119358"&&Thank you.
id="t-1119358"&&Thank you. 

id="t-794720"&&Each time I street juggle I use improvisation.
id="t-808765"&&Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown.
id="t-815167"&&And since what's impossible is always unknown, it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible. 

id="t-826889"&&Now I have done the impossible not once, but many times.
id="t-826889"&&Now I have done the impossible not once, but many times.
id="t-826889"&&Now I have done the impossible not once, but many times.
id="t-826889"&&Now I have done the impossible not once, but many times.

id="t-833964"&&Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high-wire walk.
id="t-840601"&&And I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben Hinnom Valley.
id="t-848384"&&And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stopped and, like a magician, I produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace. 

id="t-860472"&&Well now I must say, it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.
id="t-866273"&&And in my hotel room, each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air, she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
id="t-866273"&&And in my hotel room, each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air, she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
id="t-866273"&&And in my hotel room, each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air, she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
id="t-879561"&&I mean, a bird needs space to fly.
id="t-881310"&&It will go perfectly on the day of the walk. 

id="t-883562"&&Now comes the day of the walk.
id="t-886943"&&Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.
id="t-890593"&&The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.
id="t-895177"&&But he seemed nervous.
id="t-898062"&&There was tension in my wire, but I also could feel tension on the ground.
id="t-902426"&&Because all those people were made up of people who, for the most part, considered each other enemies. 

So I start the walk.
So I start the walk.
id="t-912464"&&I stop in the middle.
id="t-914242"&&I make the dove appear.
id="t-916961"&&People applaud in delight.
id="t-918877"&&And then in the most magnificent gesture, I send the bird of peace into the azure.
id="t-925177"&&But the bird, instead of flying away, goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.
id="t-63273"&&(Laughter) And people scream.
id="t-933960"&&So I grab the dove, and for the second time I send her in the air.
id="t-941374"&&But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school, goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole. 

id="t-63273"&&(Laughter) 

You laugh, you laugh.
You laugh, you laugh.
You laugh, you laugh.
You laugh, you laugh.
id="t-955594"&&Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.
id="t-958813"&&They must think this guy with this dove, he must have spent years working with him.
id="t-963343"&&What a genius, what a professional. 

id="t-63273"&&(Laughter) 

So I take a bow.
So I take a bow.
id="t-969710"&&And at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird.
id="t-973295"&&Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly, does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop and ends up on the wire behind me.
id="t-981728"&&And the entire valley goes crazy. 

id="t-984744"&&Now but hold on, I'm not finished.
id="t-986827"&&So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.
id="t-992010"&&And something happened.
id="t-993593"&&Somebody somewhere, a group of people, starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.
id="t-999244"&&And within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps.
id="t-1005077"&&But not an applause of delight like before, an applause encouragement.
id="t-1010594"&&For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
id="t-1014759"&&They had become one, pushing me to triumph. 

id="t-1019708"&&I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony.
id="t-1025388"&&So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.
id="t-1028524"&&So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison. 

id="t-1032424"&&(Clapping) 

id="t-655113"&&(Applause) 

id="t-596243"&&So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.
id="t-1047919"&&And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.
id="t-1054007"&&He didn't know the true story.
id="t-1055424"&&And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard-to-manage city, instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says, "If Philippe can do that, I can do this," and he goes back to work. 

id="t-1070442"&&Inspiration.
id="t-1079468"&&By inspiring ourselves we inspire others.
id="t-1084106"&&I will never forget this music, and I hope now neither will you.
id="t-1088406"&&Please take this music with you home, and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly, and look at the world from a different perspective.
id="t-1102970"&&And when you see mountains, remember mountains can be moved. 

id="t-655113"&&(Applause) 

id="t-1119358"&&Thank you.
id="t-1119358"&&Thank you.
id="t-1119358"&&Thank you. 

id="t-655113"&&(Applause)
