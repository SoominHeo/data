id="t-442"&&Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name to say, "I exist."
id="t-6181"&&Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say, "They exist."
id="t-13531"&&From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine, the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio, paper and glue -- as easy as that. 

id="t-26087"&&I asked a question last year: Can art change the world?
id="t-30581"&&Well let me tell you, in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year, because the Arab Spring is still spreading, the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?
id="t-42827"&&The Occupy movement found a voice, and I still have to speak English constantly.
id="t-48292"&&So there has been a lot of change. 

id="t-51125"&&So when I had my TED wish last year, I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
id="t-56423"&&You are going to take the photos.
id="t-59091"&&You're going to send them to me.
id="t-61671"&&I'm going to print them and send them back to you.
id="t-64888"&&Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. 

id="t-69260"&&This is Inside Out.
id="t-71729"&&One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.
id="t-75912"&&Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.
id="t-79912"&&And we keep sending more every day.
id="t-82167"&&This is the size.
id="t-83611"&&Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.
id="t-87533"&&This one was from Haiti. 

id="t-91048"&&When I launched my wish last year, hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.
id="t-97925"&&But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked: no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.
id="t-107858"&&A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world.
id="t-116208"&&These are the people I want to talk about to you today. 

id="t-121020"&&Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia, hundreds of portraits were made.
id="t-130545"&&And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator [with] their own photos.
id="t-130545"&&And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator [with] their own photos.
id="t-130545"&&And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator [with] their own photos.
id="t-139125"&&Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country.
id="t-146413"&&They really make Inside Out their own project.
id="t-150496"&&Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station, and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. 

Russia.
Russia.
id="t-166417"&&He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say, "We have rights."
id="t-174760"&&They used Inside Out as a platform for protest. 

id="t-179291"&&Karachi, Pakistan.
id="t-181208"&&Sharmeen is actually here.
id="t-183008"&&She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town.
id="t-191667"&&And I want to thank her today. 

North Dakota.
North Dakota.
id="t-206865"&&The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.
id="t-210500"&&He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.
id="t-213475"&&And he's here also today.
id="t-215342"&&Each time I get a wall in New York, I use his photos to continue spreading the project. 

id="t-223863"&&Juarez: You've heard of the border -- one of the most dangerous borders in the world.
id="t-229750"&&Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border.
id="t-237308"&&Do you know what it takes to do this?
id="t-239333"&&People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.
id="t-243435"&&It was amazing. 

id="t-245554"&&While in Iran at the same time Abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government.
id="t-257261"&&I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action. 

id="t-261971"&&There are tons of school projects.
id="t-264573"&&Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.
id="t-268223"&&Education is so essential.
id="t-270123"&&Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them, they paste them on the school.
id="t-275133"&&Here they even got the help of the firemen.
id="t-277125"&&There should be even more schools doing this kind of project. 

id="t-280900"&&Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
id="t-280900"&&Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
id="t-280900"&&Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
id="t-289770"&&You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo, 30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.
id="t-296104"&&Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street.
id="t-305167"&&This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.
id="t-309244"&&They were all holding their photo as a statement.
id="t-311554"&&On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.
id="t-315583"&&It's everywhere.
id="t-317085"&&Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there. 

id="t-320104"&&These projects took thousands of actions in one year, making hundreds of thousands of people participating, creating millions of views.
id="t-331633"&&This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on. 

id="t-338738"&&So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"
id="t-338738"&&So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"
id="t-338738"&&So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"
id="t-346456"&&But maybe we should change the question.
id="t-349186"&&Can art change people's lives?
id="t-351725"&&From what I've seen this year, yes.
id="t-351725"&&From what I've seen this year, yes.
id="t-351725"&&From what I've seen this year, yes.
id="t-358283"&&Let's turn the world inside out together.
id="t-361071"&&Thank you. 

id="t-362464"&&(Applause)
