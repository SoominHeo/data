id="t-0"&&So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.
id="t-3671"&&It has generated considerable insight in physics, in biology and economics, but not that much in the humanities and in history.
id="t-10900"&&I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind, that you cannot measure history.
id="t-18348"&&But I don't think that's right.
id="t-19875"&&I want to show you a couple of examples why. 

id="t-21917"&&So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact: that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language.
id="t-29371"&&That's a powerful historical force.
id="t-31675"&&So the king of England, Alfred the Great, will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.
id="t-38788"&&(Laughter) Now it's just the way it is.
id="t-42625"&&Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force. 

id="t-44917"&&So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.
id="t-47204"&&So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.
id="t-50861"&&So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.
id="t-50861"&&So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.
id="t-50861"&&So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.
id="t-56052"&&But some verbs are irregular.
id="t-57396"&&"Yesterday I thought."
id="t-58792"&&Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.
id="t-64288"&&Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular. 

id="t-67023"&&So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of English language, and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change, namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another, it regularizes 10 times slower.
id="t-84742"&&That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping. 

id="t-88677"&&Now in some cases math can even help explain, or propose explanations for, historical forces.
id="t-95210"&&So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.
id="t-100894"&&There's actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller.
id="t-108763"&&So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I.
id="t-116904"&&So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?
id="t-119827"&&What's the origin of this? 

id="t-121827"&&So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis, propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this, which lies in our brains.
id="t-130023"&&This is a very well-known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways -- quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.
id="t-138733"&&For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.
id="t-144042"&&It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.
id="t-147486"&&But it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.
id="t-155285"&&So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.
id="t-171596"&&And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before. 

id="t-174681"&&So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. 

id="t-186025"&&So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them, but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.
id="t-192731"&&The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.
id="t-197583"&&So there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time.
id="t-202504"&&Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million actually.
id="t-206542"&&And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture. 

id="t-217600"&&So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.
id="t-226400"&&And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.
id="t-230521"&&It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. 

id="t-238723"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-240214"&&(Applause)
