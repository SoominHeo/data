id="t-686"&&So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.
id="t-7394"&&But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is. 

id="t-13625"&&The 404 page is that.
id="t-16731"&&It's that broken experience on the Web.
id="t-19071"&&It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.
id="t-24958"&&And it serves you the 404 page.
id="t-27258"&&It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.
id="t-32083"&&And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself, it's annoying when you hit this thing.
id="t-37750"&&Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. 

id="t-40008"&&And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, where does 404 come from?
id="t-44625"&&It's from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors, which, when I started digging into them, it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.
id="t-55917"&&You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey. 

id="t-59042"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-61931"&&Yes. 

id="t-63958"&&But these things are everywhere.
id="t-66202"&&They're on sites big, they're on sites small.
id="t-68898"&&This is a global experience. 

id="t-71583"&&What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks.
id="t-78617"&&And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this.
id="t-82819"&&You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.
id="t-88887"&&A 404 page is not what you're looking for.
id="t-90977"&&You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.
id="t-94429"&&Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk.
id="t-102104"&&And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"
id="t-104083"&&And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.
id="t-106248"&&And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."
id="t-109190"&&That's the 404 feeling. 

id="t-59042"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-112952"&&I mean, I've heard about that. 

id="t-115208"&&So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator, and we had eight startups sitting around there.
id="t-122677"&&And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not, until one day Athletepath, which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes, found this video. 

id="t-132625"&&(Video) Guy: Joey! 

id="t-136190"&&Crowd: Whoa! 

id="t-140994"&&Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
id="t-144375"&&They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
id="t-151250"&&Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404. 

id="t-59042"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-158685"&&(Applause) 

id="t-160466"&&So this turned into a contest.
id="t-162833"&&Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page.
id="t-167579"&&Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, commiserated with your pet.
id="t-173315"&&Each one of them found this.
id="t-174708"&&It turned into a 24-hour contest.
id="t-175958"&&At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.
id="t-179083"&&And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands.
id="t-185530"&&So you take a look out in the real world, and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.
id="t-189900"&&You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.
id="t-192831"&&This is one that commiserates with you.
id="t-194829"&&This is one that blames you.
id="t-196579"&&This is one that I loved.
id="t-198417"&&This is an error page, but what if this error page was also an opportunity? 

id="t-204796"&&So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be.
id="t-211555"&&Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you. 

id="t-222565"&&Thank you. 

id="t-158685"&&(Applause)
