id="t-750"&&I'm a very lucky person.
id="t-4059"&&I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it.
id="t-10865"&&And my passion was inspired at the age of seven, when my parents first took me to Morocco, at the edge of the Sahara Desert.
id="t-18946"&&Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.
id="t-24442"&&What an amazing experience.
id="t-26718"&&And it made me want to explore more. 

id="t-29211"&&So as a filmmaker, I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before.
id="t-41125"&&And what's more, I'm really lucky, because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.
id="t-46875"&&Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. 

id="t-58816"&&You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects, but new technology is changing the way we can film.
id="t-68539"&&It's enabling us to get fresh, new images and tell brand new stories.
id="t-74492"&&In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that. 

id="t-83167"&&Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.
id="t-86208"&&You see them all the time, you think.
id="t-89458"&&But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed.
id="t-95250"&&So what we did, we went to Alaska, which is where the grizzlies rely on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes for their denning.
id="t-106789"&&And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air. 

id="t-114304"&&(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.
id="t-124129"&&There is nothing to eat up here, but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
id="t-131583"&&Lots of snow in which to dig a den.
id="t-139450"&&To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast, where the snow will already be melting.
id="t-152502"&&But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
id="t-185723"&&These mountains are dangerous places, but ultimately the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon. 

id="t-201064"&&KB: I love that shot.
id="t-203625"&&I always get goosebumps every time I see it.
id="t-205917"&&That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilized camera.
id="t-210750"&&And it's a wonderful bit of gear, because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.
id="t-217167"&&But technology alone isn't enough.
id="t-220375"&&To really get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time.
id="t-225917"&&And that sequence was especially difficult. 

id="t-228875"&&The first year we got nothing.
id="t-232375"&&We had to go back the following year, all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.
id="t-238958"&&And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.
id="t-241583"&&And eventually we got lucky.
id="t-244625"&&The cloud lifted, the wind was still, and even the bear showed up.
id="t-250708"&&And we managed to get that magic moment. 

id="t-253292"&&For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered.
id="t-265500"&&Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.
id="t-273500"&&In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.
id="t-282083"&&And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower.
id="t-289620"&&It depends solely on the bat. 

id="t-291583"&&Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this.
id="t-296744"&&See what you think.
id="t-301590"&&(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.
id="t-310536"&&A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.
id="t-315042"&&But how to reach it?
id="t-319887"&&Necessity is the mother of evolution.
id="t-325083"&&(Music) This two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue, the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world.
id="t-364438"&&If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
id="t-376122"&&(Applause) KB: What a tongue.
id="t-380677"&&We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.
id="t-390167"&&So imagine how quick that thing is in real life. 

id="t-393250"&&Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"
id="t-398462"&&And the truth is I just don't have one.
id="t-400995"&&There are so many wonderful places.
id="t-403542"&&But some locations draw you back time and time again.
id="t-407042"&&And one remote location -- I first went there as a backpacker; I've been back several times for filming, most recently for Untamed Americas -- it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America, and it's the most otherworldly place I know.
id="t-425792"&&But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.
id="t-428894"&&It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you.
id="t-435083"&&Sometimes it's hard to breathe, especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.
id="t-440437"&&And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.
id="t-445042"&&But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity.
id="t-455710"&&Have a look. 

id="t-459896"&&(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics, between Chile and Bolivia, the Andes completely change.
id="t-470413"&&It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" -- a place of extremes and extreme contrasts.
id="t-482614"&&Where deserts freeze and waters boil.
id="t-490958"&&More like Mars than Earth, it seems just as hostile to life.
id="t-505196"&&The stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing.
id="t-526929"&&Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
id="t-532813"&&But just looking up with the naked eye, you really don't need one.
id="t-325083"&&(Music) (Applause) 

id="t-593167"&&KB: Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.
id="t-601867"&&Thank you for letting me share that with you.
id="t-376122"&&(Applause)
