id="t-467"&&When we think of games, there's all kinds of things.
id="t-2498"&&Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game.
id="t-2498"&&Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game.
id="t-6728"&&All these things happen to me.
id="t-8896"&&But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player.
id="t-16293"&&This is one my partner and I worked on.
id="t-18161"&&Maybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.
id="t-18161"&&Maybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.
id="t-22663"&&Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.
id="t-28632"&&This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out.
id="t-32829"&&Or maybe you're in your living room, you know, playing with the Wii with the kids, or something like that, and, you know, there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.

id="t-47950"&&But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable, but let's just think about this.
id="t-53215"&&So this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.
id="t-55943"&&Now I don't know where you guys were, but I was in my living room.
id="t-55943"&&Now I don't know where you guys were, but I was in my living room.
id="t-60386"&&And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.
id="t-60386"&&And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.
id="t-60386"&&And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.

id="t-60386"&&And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.
id="t-75081"&&And so this was just an amazing experience. 

id="t-77941"&&Or, you know, if anybody here is from Boston -- So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after, I believe, 351 years, when they won the World Series, it was amazing.
id="t-89898"&&I happened to be living in Springfield at the time, and the best part of it was -- is that -- you would close the women's door in the bathroom, and I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?
id="t-99474"&&Or the houses, you'd come out, because every game, well, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?
id="t-105222"&&So we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on on the whole block, and kids, like, the attendance was down in school, and kids weren't going to school.
id="t-113402"&&But it's okay, it's the Red Sox, right?
id="t-115415"&&I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked.
id="t-119417"&&So this was an amazing experience, and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles, people didn't say -- you know, really, "I can die now because the Red Sox won."
id="t-119417"&&So this was an amazing experience, and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles, people didn't say -- you know, really, "I can die now because the Red Sox won."

id="t-130788"&&So games, it means something more to us.
id="t-134169"&&It absolutely means something more. 

id="t-135540"&&So now, just, this is an abrupt transition here.
id="t-137997"&&There was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.
id="t-140888"&&I was the head of a college department teaching games, so, again, it was sort of a real job, and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them.

id="t-177231"&&And this is one of my favorite shots here.
id="t-179492"&&So you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.
id="t-179492"&&So you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.
id="t-184680"&&And this is actually from his Degradation series.
id="t-187153"&&And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just, look at that little boy there.
id="t-187153"&&And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just, look at that little boy there.

id="t-196786"&&Just imagine if that's a black guy.
id="t-198884"&&So, "Honey, come here, let's get your picture with the black guy."
id="t-198884"&&So, "Honey, come here, let's get your picture with the black guy."
id="t-198884"&&So, "Honey, come here, let's get your picture with the black guy."

id="t-217234"&&So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer, and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred, and it was on an Indian reservation.

id="t-236964"&&And that was fascinating to me as a game designer, because it never occurs to me, like, should I make the game about this difficult topic or not?
id="t-243726"&&Because we just make things that are fun or, you know, will make you feel fear, you know, that visceral excitement.
id="t-249170"&&But every other medium does it. 

So this is my kid.
So this is my kid.
id="t-259448"&&So she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."

Now, this was a big moment.
Now, this was a big moment.
Now, this was a big moment.
Now, this was a big moment.

id="t-270603"&&Anyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"

id="t-273948"&&So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
id="t-279254"&&So the ships start in England, they come down from England, they go to Africa, they go across the ocean -- that's the Middle Passage part — they come to America where the slaves are sold, she's telling me.
id="t-287344"&&But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free. 

id="t-292738"&&Pause for about 10 seconds. 

id="t-295308"&&"Can I play a game, Mommy?"

And I thought, that's it?
And I thought, that's it?
And I thought, that's it?
And I thought, that's it?

id="t-319490"&&And so I happened to have all of these little pieces.
id="t-321798"&&I'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.
id="t-324464"&&So I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these, and I tell her to paint them in different families.
id="t-324464"&&So I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these, and I tell her to paint them in different families.
id="t-332189"&&So she's painting her little families.
id="t-334513"&&So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
id="t-334513"&&So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
id="t-334513"&&So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
id="t-334513"&&So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.

id="t-334513"&&So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
id="t-353075"&&Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."
id="t-355191"&&So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother, and as we're going across the ocean, following these rules, she realizes that she's rolling pretty high, and she says to me, "We're not going to make it."
id="t-368193"&&And she realizes, you know, we don't have enough food, and so she asks what to do, and I say, "Well, we can either" -- Remember, she's seven -- "We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side."
id="t-380979"&&And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right?
id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"

id="t-388137"&&After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
id="t-407628"&&And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.
id="t-407628"&&And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.
id="t-407628"&&And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.

id="t-417707"&&And so, we made this game, and she got it.
id="t-420589"&&She got it because she spent time with these people.
id="t-423369"&&It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie. 

id="t-426638"&&And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.
id="t-429730"&&This is the game, which I've ended up calling The New World, because I like the phrase.
id="t-433668"&&I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships. 

id="t-438984"&&But when this happened, I saw the whole planet.
id="t-438984"&&But when this happened, I saw the whole planet.
id="t-438984"&&But when this happened, I saw the whole planet.
id="t-446846"&&My history is Irish.
id="t-446846"&&My history is Irish.
id="t-446846"&&My history is Irish.
id="t-450941"&&It's the entire history of my family in a single game. 

id="t-453433"&&I made another game called Train.
id="t-455138"&&I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. 

id="t-465049"&&And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.
id="t-468962"&&This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.
id="t-471440"&&I was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.
id="t-475111"&&It's the same thing.
id="t-476099"&&I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games. 

id="t-478604"&&And the one I'm working on right now, which is -- because I'm right in the middle of it, and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers.
id="t-485619"&&And originally it was a math problem more or less.
id="t-488333"&&Like, here's the economics of illegal immigration.
id="t-490972"&&And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that.
id="t-490972"&&And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that.

id="t-507491"&&I'll look away from the picture.
id="t-507491"&&I'll look away from the picture.
id="t-507491"&&I'll look away from the picture.
id="t-512553"&&It's how they say they care, and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying "food" in the first sentence.
id="t-519123"&&And so to me, this beautiful culture, this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games. 

id="t-526593"&&And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics, it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves.
id="t-535318"&&We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so.
id="t-535318"&&We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so.
