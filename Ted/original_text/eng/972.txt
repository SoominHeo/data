id="t-0"&&It's a great honor to be here.
id="t-3000"&&It's a great honor to be here talking about cities, talking about the future of cities.
id="t-8000"&&It's great to be here as a mayor.
id="t-10000"&&I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives.
id="t-16000"&&That's the place to be.
id="t-18000"&&And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.
id="t-21000"&&Rio's a beautiful city, a vibrant place, special place.
id="t-25000"&&Actually, you're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world.
id="t-29000"&&And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio. 

id="t-35000"&&(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the envelope containing the result.
id="t-40000"&&Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce that the games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.
id="t-49000"&&(Cheering) 

id="t-55000"&&EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional, but it was not easy to get there.
id="t-60000"&&Actually it was a very hard challenge.
id="t-63000"&&We had to beat the European monarchy.
id="t-66000"&&This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.
id="t-69000"&&We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.
id="t-72000"&&We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city.
id="t-78000"&&So it was not easy at all.
id="t-80000"&&And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that I think fits perfectly to the situation of Rio winning the Olympic bid.
id="t-88000"&&We really showed that, yes, we can. 

id="t-92000"&&And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.
id="t-94000"&&I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done, that you don't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way, that cities are a great challenge.
id="t-106000"&&It's a difficult task to deal with cities.
id="t-108000"&&But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live.
id="t-119000"&&I want you all to imagine Rio.
id="t-121000"&&You probably think about a city full of energy, a vibrant city full of green.
id="t-126000"&&And nobody showed that better than Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."

id="t-130000"&&(Music) (Video) Bird: This is incredible.
id="t-130000"&&(Music) 

id="t-152000"&&EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that, but it's not like that everywhere.
id="t-157000"&&We're like every big city in the world.
id="t-159000"&&We've got lots of people, pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.
id="t-164000"&&These pictures I'm showing here, they are some pictures from Madureira.
id="t-168000"&&It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.
id="t-170000"&&And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira, in this region, to see what we should think as our first commandment. 

id="t-177000"&&So every time you see a concrete jungle like that, what you've got to do is find open spaces.
id="t-183000"&&If you don't have open spaces, you've got to go there and open spaces.
id="t-187000"&&So go inside these open spaces and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces.
id="t-193000"&&This is going to be the third largest park in Rio by June this year.
id="t-198000"&&It's going to be a place where people can meet, where you can put nature.
id="t-202000"&&The temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.
id="t-205000"&&So the first commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly.
id="t-215000"&&Every time you think of a city, you've got to think green.
id="t-219000"&&You've got to think green and green. 

id="t-222000"&&So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.
id="t-225000"&&Let's think that cities are made of people, lots of people together.
id="t-229000"&&cities are packed with people.
id="t-231000"&&So how do you move these people around?
id="t-234000"&&When you have 3.5 billion people living in cities -- by 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.
id="t-240000"&&So every time you think about moving these people around, you think about high-capacity transportation.
id="t-245000"&&But there is a problem.
id="t-247000"&&High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money. 

id="t-252000"&&So what I'm going to show here is something that was already presented in TED by the former mayor of Curitiba who created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.
id="t-261000"&&And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.
id="t-264000"&&It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.
id="t-264000"&&It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.
id="t-264000"&&It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.
id="t-269000"&&You transform it inside as a train car.
id="t-272000"&&You use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.
id="t-275000"&&The contractors, they don't like that.
id="t-277000"&&You don't have to dig deep down underground.
id="t-280000"&&You can build nice stations.
id="t-282000"&&This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.
id="t-285000"&&Again, you don't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that.
id="t-289000"&&This station has the same comfort, the same features as a subway station.
id="t-294000"&&A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.
id="t-297000"&&So spending much less money and doing it much faster, you can really change the way people move. 

id="t-302000"&&This is a map of Rio.
id="t-304000"&&All the lines, the colored lines you see there, it's our high-capacity transportation network.
id="t-310000"&&In this present time today, we only carry 18 percent of our population in high-capacity transportation.
id="t-317000"&&With the BRTs we're doing, again, the cheapest and fastest way, we're going to move to 63 percent of the population being carried by high-capacity transportation. 

id="t-328000"&&So remember what I said: You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done.
id="t-334000"&&You can find original ways to get things done.
id="t-337000"&&So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people. 

id="t-347000"&&Moving to the third commandment.
id="t-350000"&&And this is the most controversial one.
id="t-352000"&&It has to do with the favelas, the slums -- whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.
id="t-358000"&&But the point we want to make here tonight is, favelas are not always a problem.
id="t-364000"&&I mean, favelas can sometimes really be a solution, if you deal with them, if you put public policy inside the favelas.
id="t-373000"&&Let me just show a map of Rio again.
id="t-375000"&&Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants -- More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.
id="t-382000"&&All these red parts are favelas.
id="t-384000"&&So you see, they are spread all over the city.
id="t-387000"&&This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.
id="t-390000"&&You see the contrast between the rich and poor. 

id="t-393000"&&So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.
id="t-396000"&&The first one is, you can change from what I call a [vicious] circle to a virtual circle.
id="t-402000"&&But what you've got to do to get that is you've got to go inside the favelas, bring in the basic services -- mainly education and health -- with high quality.
id="t-412000"&&I'm going to give a fast example here.
id="t-414000"&&This was an old building in a favela in Rio -- [unclear favela name] -- that we just transformed into a primary school, with high quality.
id="t-424000"&&This is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela, again, with high quality.
id="t-430000"&&We call it a family clinic.
id="t-432000"&&So the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality. 

id="t-438000"&&The second point I want to make about the favelas is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.
id="t-442000"&&Bring infrastructure to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.
id="t-447000"&&Rio has the aim, by 2020, to have all its favelas completely urbanized.
id="t-452000"&&Another example, this was completely packed with houses, and then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.
id="t-458000"&&This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology.
id="t-466000"&&We even built a theater there -- 3D movie.
id="t-469000"&&And this is the kind of change you can get for that.
id="t-473000"&&And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela.
id="t-480000"&&So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is, a city of the future has to be socially integrated.
id="t-488000"&&You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated. 

id="t-492000"&&But moving to our fourth commandment, I really wouldn't be here tonight.
id="t-498000"&&Between November and May, Rio's completely packed.
id="t-503000"&&We just had last week Carnivale.
id="t-503000"&&We just had last week Carnivale.
id="t-503000"&&We just had last week Carnivale.
id="t-507000"&&We have New Year's Eve.
id="t-509000"&&There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.
id="t-511000"&&We have problems.
id="t-513000"&&We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.
id="t-516000"&&You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes.
id="t-520000"&&We have problems with the tropical rains.
id="t-523000"&&Almost every year we have these landslides, which are terrible. 

id="t-527000"&&But the reason I could come here is because of that.
id="t-531000"&&This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old.
id="t-536000"&&It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.
id="t-539000"&&And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology, from here, from Long Beach, so I got here last night and I know everything.
id="t-546000"&&We're going to speak now to the Operations Center.
id="t-548000"&&This is Osorio, he's our secretary of urban affairs.
id="t-552000"&&So Osorio, good to be there with you.
id="t-555000"&&I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year.
id="t-560000"&&So how's the weather in Rio now? 

Osorio: The weather is fine.
Osorio: The weather is fine.
id="t-565000"&&Let me get you our weather satellite radar.
id="t-568000"&&You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.
id="t-571000"&&Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather, today and in the next few days. 

id="t-577000"&&EP: Okay, how's the traffic?
id="t-579000"&&We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.
id="t-579000"&&We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.
id="t-579000"&&We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.

id="t-584000"&&Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine.
id="t-586000"&&Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses.
id="t-590000"&&A live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.
id="t-593000"&&You see, the streets are clear.
id="t-595000"&&Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio.
id="t-598000"&&Nothing of concern in terms of traffic.
id="t-600000"&&I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.
id="t-603000"&&We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern.
id="t-610000"&&We are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city. 

id="t-614000"&&EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.
id="t-616000"&&These are the cars. 

id="t-618000"&&Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.
id="t-620000"&&Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.
id="t-623000"&&This is live transmission.
id="t-625000"&&We have GPS's in all of our trucks.
id="t-627000"&&And you can see them working in all parts of the city.
id="t-631000"&&Waste collection on time.
id="t-633000"&&Public services working well. 

id="t-635000"&&EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.
id="t-637000"&&It was great to have you here.
id="t-639000"&&We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.
id="t-641000"&&(Applause) Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork, no distance, 24/7 working.
id="t-651000"&&So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight is, a city of the future has to use technology to be present.
id="t-658000"&&I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city. 

id="t-661000"&&But everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments, are means, are ways, for us to govern cities -- invest in infrastructure, invest in the green, open parks, open spaces, integrate socially, use technology.
id="t-676000"&&But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities, we talk about a gathering of people.
id="t-681000"&&And we cannot see that as a problem.
id="t-683000"&&That is fantastic.
id="t-685000"&&If there's 3.5 billion now, it's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.
id="t-689000"&&That is great, that means we're going to have 10 billion minds working together, 10 billion talents together. 

id="t-697000"&&So a city of the future, I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens, integrates socially its citizens.
id="t-706000"&&A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party, which are cities. 

id="t-711000"&&Thank you very much. 

id="t-641000"&&(Applause)
