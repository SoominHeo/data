id="t-634"&&I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work.
id="t-7961"&&I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.
id="t-17903"&&Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet. 

id="t-31504"&&My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit.
id="t-47185"&&I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.
id="t-52230"&&If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them. 

id="t-61545"&&Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
id="t-69497"&&And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report.
id="t-77193"&&Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020.
id="t-83521"&&And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end.
id="t-90364"&&I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics may not. 

id="t-102684"&&My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change.
id="t-107710"&&On-site, I take thousands of photographs.
id="t-110696"&&Back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes over 10 feet wide. 

id="t-121412"&&I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors.
id="t-126456"&&I consider my work drawings but others call them painting.
id="t-130203"&&I cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a "finger painter."

id="t-134248"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-135390"&&But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper.
id="t-143990"&&Drawing is a form of meditation for me.
id="t-148354"&&It quiets my mind.
id="t-150437"&&I don't perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water.
id="t-153665"&&Instead, the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape.
id="t-160964"&&Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting with foam.
id="t-171884"&&On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10 seconds. 

id="t-134248"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-179348"&&(Applause) 

id="t-183336"&&Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size.
id="t-187816"&&But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.
id="t-190822"&&My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had art supplies all over the house.
id="t-195269"&&My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures.
id="t-207139"&&We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole. 

id="t-213871"&&In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.
id="t-224232"&&My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.
id="t-227146"&&She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor.
id="t-235812"&&The cancer quickly took over her body and mind, and she passed away six months later.
id="t-243110"&&During the months of her illness, though, her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final journey. 

id="t-253374"&&My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape.
id="t-266738"&&The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling.
id="t-271168"&&The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected.
id="t-277284"&&I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced.
id="t-285021"&&Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability.
id="t-291042"&&From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun. 

id="t-298940"&&We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges.
id="t-305381"&&The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did.
id="t-311431"&&And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival. 

id="t-320616"&&The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
id="t-332942"&&One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
id="t-340752"&&While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century. 

id="t-357484"&&Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal.
id="t-364844"&&When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
id="t-370743"&&Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form. 

id="t-381095"&&Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the negative.
id="t-389083"&&My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.
id="t-395845"&&I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future. 

id="t-409102"&&Thank you. 

id="t-179348"&&(Applause)
