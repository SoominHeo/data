id="t-0"&&Hi, my name is Frank, and I collect secrets.
id="t-4000"&&It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004.
id="t-9000"&&I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards, just like this.
id="t-14000"&&They were blank on one side, and on the other side I listed some simple instructions.
id="t-20000"&&I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they'd never told anyone before.
id="t-26000"&&And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect. 

id="t-32000"&&But soon the idea began spreading virally.
id="t-35000"&&People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards.
id="t-40000"&&I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox, not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C., but from Texas, California, Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.
id="t-51000"&&Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.
id="t-55000"&&PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.
id="t-61000"&&And this is my postcard collection today.
id="t-66000"&&You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets. 

id="t-74000"&&What I'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection, starting with this one.
id="t-85000"&&"I found these stamps as a child, and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to.
id="t-93000"&&I never did have someone."
id="t-95000"&&Secrets can take many forms.
id="t-97000"&&They can be shocking or silly or soulful.
id="t-102000"&&They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet.
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) Maybe one of you sent this one in.
id="t-121000"&&I don't know.
id="t-123000"&&This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard.
id="t-129000"&&This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side. 

id="t-138000"&&"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
id="t-138000"&&"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
id="t-138000"&&"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
id="t-146000"&&Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas, of frailty and heroism, playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now.
id="t-160000"&&"Everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes I'm dead."
id="t-173000"&&"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people, so sometimes I didn't wear panties, and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-189000"&&This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.
id="t-192000"&&I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students.
id="t-197000"&&And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students.
id="t-203000"&&And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos.
id="t-207000"&&And I should also mention that, just like today, at that PostSecret event, I was using a wireless microphone.
id="t-216000"&&"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.
id="t-218000"&&We all heard you pee."
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) This was really embarrassing when it happened, until I realized it could have been worse.
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) This was really embarrassing when it happened, until I realized it could have been worse.
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) This was really embarrassing when it happened, until I realized it could have been worse.

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-242000"&&"Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn't use.
id="t-248000"&&I feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"
id="t-256000"&&"One of these men is the father of my son.
id="t-259000"&&He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-272000"&&"That Saturday when you wondered where I was, well, I was getting your ring.
id="t-277000"&&It's in my pocket right now."
id="t-279000"&&I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day.
id="t-284000"&&It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
id="t-287000"&&And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard. 

id="t-294000"&&And he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life."
id="t-299000"&&He said, "My knees are still shaking."
id="t-302000"&&He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I, we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud.
id="t-311000"&&I read some to her, she reads some to me."
id="t-314000"&&He says, "It's really brought us closer together through the years. 

id="t-318000"&&And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom, I was beside myself.
id="t-326000"&&And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
id="t-328000"&&And just like every Sunday, we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
id="t-334000"&&He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one."
id="t-339000"&&But she finally did.
id="t-341000"&&She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.
id="t-344000"&&And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."
id="t-349000"&&And she turned to him and said, "Is that our cat?"
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) And when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) And when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) And when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.

id="t-368000"&&So I emailed him back and I said, "Please share with me an image, something, that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."
id="t-378000"&&And he emailed me this picture. 

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-385000"&&"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
id="t-388000"&&I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you."
id="t-395000"&&This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it, but this secret has impacted many lives, starting with a student up in Canada named Matty.
id="t-407000"&&Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website, a website called IFoundYourCamera.
id="t-414000"&&Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found, memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos.
id="t-423000"&&And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week.
id="t-428000"&&And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for.
id="t-440000"&&This one's my favorite. 

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-445000"&&Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers.
id="t-452000"&&And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is, but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.
id="t-458000"&&Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture.
id="t-466000"&&"That's me, my husband and son.
id="t-469000"&&The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.
id="t-473000"&&Thank you for making your site.
id="t-475000"&&These pictures mean more to me than you know.
id="t-478000"&&My son's birth is on this camera.
id="t-480000"&&He turns four tomorrow."
id="t-484000"&&Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans, sometimes going through language barriers. 

id="t-497000"&&This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.
id="t-500000"&&"When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again."
id="t-514000"&&When I posted this secret, dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones, sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years, messages from family or friends who had died.
id="t-529000"&&They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them, it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
id="t-538000"&&One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother. 

id="t-95000"&&Secrets can take many forms.
id="t-97000"&&They can be shocking or silly or soulful.
id="t-554000"&&They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. 

id="t-561000"&&Voicemail recording: First saved voice message.
id="t-565000"&&Grandma: ♫ It's somebody's birthday today ♫ ♫ Somebody's birthday today ♫ ♫ The candles are lighted ♫ ♫ on somebody's cake ♫ ♫ And we're all invited ♫ ♫ for somebody's sake ♫ You're 21 years old today.
id="t-588000"&&Have a real happy birthday, and I love you.
id="t-591000"&&I'll say bye for now. 

id="t-593000"&&FW: Thank you. 

id="t-595000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-601000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-595000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-614000"&&June Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful, so touching.
id="t-618000"&&Have you ever sent yourself a postcard?
id="t-620000"&&Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret? 

id="t-622000"&&FW: I have one of my own secrets in every book.
id="t-625000"&&I think in some ways, the reason I started the project, even though I didn't know it at the time, was because I was struggling with my own secrets.
id="t-633000"&&And it was through crowd-sourcing, it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me, that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me. 

id="t-643000"&&JC: And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book?
id="t-647000"&&Has anyone in your life been able to tell? 

id="t-649000"&&FW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah. 

id="t-111000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-595000"&&(Applause)
