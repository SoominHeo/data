id="t-0"&&You know, cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.
id="t-6000"&&For students, it's quite an experience, but for a school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain.
id="t-15000"&&So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught, they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.
id="t-23000"&&Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are, cadavers may not be easily available. 

id="t-30000"&&So to address this, we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.
id="t-37000"&&So we call this Anatomage Table.
id="t-42000"&&So with this Anatomage Table, students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver.
id="t-51000"&&And the table form is important, and since it's touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab, or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table.
id="t-69000"&&Our digital body is one-to-one life size, so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy. 

id="t-80000"&&I'm going to do some demonstrations.
id="t-86000"&&As you can see, I use my finger to interact with my digital body.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to do some cuts.
id="t-95000"&&I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.
id="t-99000"&&Then it's going to show inside.
id="t-103000"&&And I can change my cut to see different parts.
id="t-111000"&&Maybe I can cut there, see the brain, and I can change my cut.
id="t-121000"&&You can see some internal organs.
id="t-124000"&&So we call this the slicer mode.
id="t-138000"&&OK, I'm going to do another cut.
id="t-145000"&&Right there.
id="t-149000"&&This shows a lot of internal structures.
id="t-152000"&&So if I want to see the back side, I can flip and see from behind.
id="t-162000"&&Like this.
id="t-165000"&&So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you, that means we did the right job.
id="t-176000"&&So our doctors said these are eye candies. 

id="t-181000"&&So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.
id="t-187000"&&What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones, just to see a few internal organs.
id="t-197000"&&Right here.
id="t-200000"&&Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here.
id="t-213000"&&OK. Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to do some surgery here.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.

id="t-226000"&&You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.
id="t-229000"&&(Laughter) But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."
id="t-229000"&&(Laughter) Okay. 

id="t-248000"&&All right then.
id="t-250000"&&Let me zoom in.
id="t-80000"&&I'm going to make a cut right there.
id="t-256000"&&And then you can see the inside of the heart.
id="t-262000"&&You can see the atrium and the ventricles, how blood flows to our arteries and veins.
id="t-268000"&&Just like this, students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to.
id="t-275000"&&It doesn't have to be always dissection.
id="t-278000"&&Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.
id="t-281000"&&So let me show you, I'm going to start with the skeletal structure, and I can add a few internal organs.
id="t-290000"&&Yep.
id="t-293000"&&Maybe I can add quickly this way.
id="t-300000"&&And I can build muscles gradually, just like that.
id="t-308000"&&We can see tendons and muscles.
id="t-310000"&&Wish I could build my muscle this fast.
id="t-229000"&&(Laughter) And this is another way to learn anatomy. 

id="t-320000"&&Another thing I can show you is, more often than not, doctors get to meet patients in X-ray form.
id="t-330000"&&So, Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.
id="t-338000"&&You can also interact with your X-ray, and also if you want, you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray, too.
id="t-352000"&&So when you are done, just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session.
id="t-362000"&&It looks like our table also can transform gender, too.
id="t-368000"&&It's a female now. 

So this is Anatomage Table.
So this is Anatomage Table.
id="t-373000"&&(Applause)
