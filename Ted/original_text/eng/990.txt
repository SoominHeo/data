id="t-0"&&This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
id="t-4000"&&The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together.
id="t-14000"&&Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world.
id="t-19000"&&They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time.
id="t-25000"&&Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. 

id="t-30000"&&Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this.
id="t-34000"&&It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
id="t-37000"&&And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household.
id="t-42000"&&It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
id="t-48000"&&You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
id="t-53000"&&LEGO made it accessible.
id="t-55000"&&LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. 

id="t-62000"&&Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block.
id="t-69000"&&The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
id="t-77000"&&Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time. 

id="t-84000"&&But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts.
id="t-88000"&&I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that.
id="t-97000"&&Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. 

id="t-105000"&&A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
id="t-108000"&&Let me show you how they work.
id="t-112000"&&LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function.
id="t-118000"&&They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
id="t-125000"&&And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets.
id="t-130000"&&So you can't put them the wrong way.
id="t-133000"&&The bricks are color-coded.
id="t-135000"&&Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire.
id="t-140000"&&So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
id="t-146000"&&You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
id="t-150000"&&You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer.
id="t-157000"&&Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker.
id="t-169000"&&Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
id="t-175000"&&I'm going to stop that. 

id="t-177000"&&So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
id="t-182000"&&Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
id="t-189000"&&So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
id="t-196000"&&The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library.
id="t-200000"&&We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick.
id="t-204000"&&Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible. 

id="t-208000"&&We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
id="t-211000"&&And it's been an incredible experience.
id="t-213000"&&The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
id="t-219000"&&For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
id="t-226000"&&We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
id="t-228000"&&So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material.
id="t-236000"&&Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ... 

id="t-241000"&&(Clanging) 

id="t-243000"&&(Buzzing) 

id="t-245000"&&A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."
id="t-255000"&&Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
id="t-260000"&&(Laughter) But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
id="t-266000"&&It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. 

id="t-260000"&&(Laughter) 

id="t-277000"&&To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material.
id="t-282000"&&And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
id="t-285000"&&So littleBits is open-source.
id="t-287000"&&You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
id="t-290000"&&We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
id="t-299000"&&So go ahead and start inventing. 

id="t-301000"&&Thank you. 

id="t-303000"&&(Applause)
