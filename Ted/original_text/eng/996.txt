id="t-0"&&So my name is Taylor Wilson.
id="t-2000"&&I am 17 years old and I am a nuclear physicist, which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.
id="t-9000"&&And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point, that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to.
id="t-20000"&&So nuclear fusion is our energy future.
id="t-23000"&&And the second point, making the case that kids can really change the world. 

id="t-27000"&&So you may ask -- (Applause) You may ask me, well how do you know what our energy future is?
id="t-37000"&&Well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old.
id="t-41000"&&That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.
id="t-44000"&&I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old.
id="t-49000"&&I decided I wanted to make a star. 

id="t-51000"&&Now most of you are probably saying, well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.
id="t-56000"&&I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.
id="t-59000"&&Well it doesn't break even.
id="t-61000"&&It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in, but it still does some pretty cool stuff.
id="t-66000"&&And I assembled this in my garage, and it now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada, Reno.
id="t-72000"&&And it slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.
id="t-77000"&&So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.
id="t-82000"&&And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together, and in the process it has some byproducts, and I utilize those byproducts. 

id="t-92000"&&So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
id="t-99000"&&I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has.
id="t-103000"&&For hundreds of dollars, I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
id="t-111000"&&I built this in my garage. 

id="t-29000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-115000"&&And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes.
id="t-119000"&&Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities I've developed a device that, on a very small scale, can produce these isotopes. 

id="t-126000"&&So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.
id="t-131000"&&That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor.
id="t-135000"&&Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage, so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.
id="t-141000"&&So maybe I don't want to admit to that.
id="t-144000"&&This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.
id="t-151000"&&And this is me with President Obama, showing him my Homeland Security research. 

id="t-29000"&&(Applause) 

id="t-161000"&&So in about seven years of doing nuclear research, I started out with a dream to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage, and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world, and I think other kids can too.
id="t-176000"&&So thank you very much. 

id="t-29000"&&(Applause)
