HD 40307 is an orange  main-sequence star located approximately 42 light-years away in the constellation of Pictor , taking its primary name from its Henry Draper Catalogue designation.
It is calculated to be slightly less massive than the Sun.
HD 40307 was observed during or before 1900 as part of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung.
The star has six known planets, three discovered in 2008 and three more in 2012.
One of them, HD 40307 g, is a potential super-Earth in the habitable zone, with an orbital period of about 200 days.
This object might be capable of supporting liquid water on its surface, although much more information must be acquired before its habitability can be assessed.
