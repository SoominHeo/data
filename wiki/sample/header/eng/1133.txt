"I Remember You" is the twenty-fifth and penultimate episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time.
The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward.
It originally aired on Cartoon Network on October 15, 2012.
The episode later re-aired on March 25, 2013, together with the fifth season episode "Simon &amp; Marcy," and as such was advertised as a half-hour special.
The series follows the adventures of Finn , a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will.
In this episode, Marceline the Vampire Queen  collaborates with the Ice King  to write a song, and Marceline tries to get the Ice King to remember who he really is.
This episode reveals that Marceline and the Ice King knew each other during aftermath of the Mushroom War, a cataclysmic event that occurred a thousand years previous.
Formerly titled "Help," "I Remember You" helped expand upon and explore the Ice King's previous life.
The episode features four songs—"The Fry Song," "Oh Bubblegum," "Nuts," and "Remember You"—all of which were written by Sugar, although Sanchez co-wrote the lyrics on "Oh Bubblegum."
Sugar used an omnichord for the demo of the eponymous song, and her playing ended up as part of the episode.
"I Remember You" was watched by 2.535 million people and received universal critical acclaim, with many critics praising the story's depth and its exploration of mental disorders, memory, and loss.
