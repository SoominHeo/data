Rhina cyclostomus Swainson, 1839 The bowmouth guitarfish , also called the shark ray or mud skate, is a species of ray and the sole member of the family Rhinidae.
Its evolutionary affinities are not fully resolved, though it may be related to true guitarfishes and skates.
This rare species occurs widely in the tropical coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific, at depths of up to 90 m .
Highly distinctive in appearance, the bowmouth guitarfish has a wide and thick body with a rounded snout and large shark-like dorsal and tail fins.
Its mouth forms a W-shaped undulating line, and there are multiple thorny ridges over its head and back.
It has a dorsal color pattern of many white spots over a bluish gray to brown background, with a pair of prominent black markings over the pectoral fins.
This large species can reach a length of 2.7 m  and weight of 135 kg .
Usually found near the sea floor, the bowmouth guitarfish prefers sandy or muddy areas near underwater structures.
It is a strong-swimming predator of bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs.
This species gives live birth to litters of two to eleven pups, which are nourished during gestation by yolk.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature  has assessed the bowmouth guitarfish as Vulnerable because it is widely caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries for its valuable fins and meat.
It is viewed as a nuisance by trawlers, however, because its bulk and thorny skin cause it to damage netted catches.
Habitat degradation and destruction pose an additional, significant challenge to this ray's survival.
The bowmouth guitarfish adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.
