"Navras" is a song from The Matrix Revolutions soundtrack by goa trance band Juno Reactor, composed by Don Davis and Juno Reactor featuring vocal elements by Lakshmi Shankar and Azam Ali.
The song contains an adaption of the Asato ma mantra found in the Hindu sacred text the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, section I.iii.28, used in the soundtrack of the movie The Matrix Revolutions.

The name Navras might refer to the notion of nine rasas  in Sanskrit aesthetics.
