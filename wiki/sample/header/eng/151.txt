The men's foil was one of three fencing events on the Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme.
It was held on the second day of competition, 7 April.
Eight fencers took part, with the preliminary fencing involving a round-robin held in two groups.
The first group was Pierrakos-Mavromichalis, Delaborde, Callot, and Poulos.
The second was Komninos-Miliotis, Balakakis, Gravelotte, and Vouros.
The two fencers that were undefeated in their groups faced each other in the final for gold and silver medals, while Pierrakos-Mavromichalis was awarded third place as he had the best record  of the remaining fencers in actual bouts.
Vouros's second win came from a forfeit by Komninos-Miliotis.
