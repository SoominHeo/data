In topology and related branches of mathematics, a T1 space is a topological space in which, for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other.
An R0 space is one in which this holds for every pair of topologically distinguishable points.
The properties T1 and R0 are examples of separation axioms.
