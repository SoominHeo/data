"Adventure Time" is an animated short created by Pendleton Ward, as well as the pilot to the Cartoon Network series of the same name.
The short follows the adventures of Pen , a human boy, and his best friend Jake , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will.
In this episode, Pen and Jake have to rescue Princess Bubblegum  from the antagonistic Ice King .
"Adventure Time" first aired as a stand-alone short on Nicktoons Network in January 2007, after which it subsequently went viral on the internet; as of April 2008, the pilot has had over 3,000,000 views.
It was then re-aired as part of Nicktoons Network's Random!
Cartoons series showcase on December 7, 2008, subsequently leading to the creation of the animated series.
It was nominated for an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject.
The short and the later-produced television series share elements, but the two differ slightly in setting, conception and continuity, especially in regard to the post-apocalyptic setting, which is only featured in the television series.
