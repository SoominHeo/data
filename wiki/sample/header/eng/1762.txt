Gabriel Naudé  was a French librarian and scholar.
He was a prolific writer who produced works on many subjects including politics, religion, history and the supernatural.
An influential work on library science was the 1627 book Advice on Establishing a Library.
Naudé was later able to put into practice all the ideas he put forth in Advice, when he was given the opportunity to build and maintain the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin.
Naudé is a precursor of Pierre Bayle and Fontenelle.
