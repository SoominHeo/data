A kotatsu  is a low, wooden table frame covered by a futon, or heavy blanket, upon which a table top sits.
Underneath is a heat source, formerly a charcoal brazier but now electric, often built into the table itself.
Kotatsu are used almost exclusively in Japan, although similar devices are used elsewhere: for example the Spanish brasero.
