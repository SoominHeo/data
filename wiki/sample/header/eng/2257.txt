Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis  is a form of tuberculosis caused by bacteria that are resistant to some of the most effective anti-TB drugs.
XDR-TB strains have arisen after the mismanagement of individuals with multidrug-resistant TB .
Almost one in four people in the world is infected with TB bacteria.
Only when the bacteria become active do people become ill with TB.
Bacteria become active as a result of anything that can reduce the personâ€™s immunity, such as HIV, advancing age, or some medical conditions.
TB can usually be treated with a course of four standard, or first-line, anti-TB drugs .
If these drugs are misused or mismanaged, multidrug-resistant TB  can develop.
MDR-TB takes longer to treat with second-line drugs , which are more expensive and have more side-effects.
XDR-TB can develop when these second-line drugs are also misused or mismanaged and therefore also become ineffective.
XDR-TB raises concerns of a future TB epidemic with restricted treatment options, and jeopardizes the major gains made in TB control and progress on reducing TB deaths among people living with HIV/AIDS.
It is therefore vital that TB control be managed properly and new tools developed to prevent, treat and diagnose the disease.
The true scale of XDR-TB is unknown as many countries lack the necessary equipment and capacity to accurately diagnose it.
It is estimated however that there are around 40,000 cases per year.
As of June 2008, 49 countries had confirmed cases of XDR-TB.
By 2013, that number had risen to 84.
