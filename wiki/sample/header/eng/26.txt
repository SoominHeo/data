The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle in the Invasion of Poland and marked the start of the Second World War in Europe.
Beginning on September 1, 1939, German naval forces and soldiers and Danzig police assaulted the Polish Military Transit Depot  on the peninsula of Westerplatte, in the harbour of the Free City of Danzig.
The Poles held out for seven days in the face of a heavy attack that included dive bomber attacks.
The defense of Westerplatte served as an inspiration for the Polish Army and people in the face of successful German advances elsewhere, and today is still regarded as a symbol of resistance to the invasion.
The site is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments , as designated September 1, 2003 and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.
