The anthem without a title was the untitled national anthem of the Netherlands Antilles.
The anthem was written in English by Zahira Hiliman from Sint Maarten and translated into the native Papiamento language by Lucille Berry-Haseth from Curaçao.
The anthem was written in two of the three official languages of the Netherlands Antilles, English and Papiamento; Dutch was the third official language.
It was adopted in 2000.
In addition to this anthem, many of the islands in the Netherlands Antilles had their own anthems.
On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved into Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the three public bodies of the Caribbean Netherlands.
