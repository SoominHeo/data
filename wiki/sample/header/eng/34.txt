In computing, the Windows Driver Model  –  also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model –  is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model.
