East Timor centavo coins were introduced in East Timor in 2003 for use alongside United States Dollar banknotes and coins, which had been introduced in 2000 to replace the Indonesian rupiah following the commencement of U.N. administration.
One centavo is equal to one US cent.
The coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and feature pictures of local plants and animals.
East Timor does not yet issue its own banknotes.
The coins are minted in Lisbon by the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national mint.
