Runglish, Rusinglish, Ruglish or Russlish , is a Russianâ€“English macaronic language.
The term "runglish" was popularized in 2000 as a name for one of the languages aboard the International Space Station.
Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalyov said: "We say jokingly that we communicate in 'Runglish,' a mixture of Russian and English languages, so that when we are short of words in one language we can use the other, because all the crew members speak both languages well."
NASA has since begun listing Runglish as one of the on-board languages.
Although less widespread than other pidgins and creoles, such as Tok Pisin, Runglish is spoken in a number of English-Russian communities, most notably the Russian-speaking community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York.
