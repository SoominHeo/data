The Roa–Hønefoss Line  is a 32-kilometer  long, single track railway line between Roa and Hønefoss in Norway.
At Roa Station, the line connects to the Gjøvik Line, while at Hønefoss Station, it connects to the Randsfjorden Line and the Bergen Line.
The line runs through Buskerud and Oppland and allowed the Bergen Line access to Oslo at Oslo East Station.
The Line was built by the Norwegian State Railways  and opened on 1 December 1909, along with the last part of the Bergen Line.
The line was electrified in 1961.
Until 1989, nearly all Oslo–Bergen trains used the line to terminate at Oslo East Station.
It was also possible to reach Oslo from Hønefoss via the Randsfjord Line, albeit terminating at Oslo West Station.
NSB also ran a local service between Hønefoss and Oslo along the Roa–Hønefoss Line.
Oslo–Bergen trains ran via the Randsfjord Line after 1989 and local train services have been terminated.
However, the line remains in use for freight trains along the Oslo–Bergen route.
