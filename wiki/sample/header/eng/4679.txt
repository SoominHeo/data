The Pons Aemilius , today called Ponte Rotto, is the oldest Roman stone bridge in Rome, Italy.
Preceded by a wooden version, it was rebuilt in stone in the 2nd century BC.
It once spanned the Tiber, connecting the Forum Boarium with Trastevere; a single arch in mid-river is all that remains today, lending the bridge its name Ponte Rotto .
