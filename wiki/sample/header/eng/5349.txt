Comics is a medium used to express ideas by images, often combined with text or other visual information.
Comics frequently takes the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images.
Often textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information.
Size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing.
Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images.
Common forms of comics include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.
Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and  for French-language comics.
There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.
The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made definition difficult.
