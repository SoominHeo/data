In mathematics, the modularity theorem  states that elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers are related to modular forms.
Andrew Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat's last theorem.
Later, Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor extended Wiles' techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001.
The modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to Robert Langlands.
The Langlands program seeks to attach an automorphic form or automorphic representation  to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a number field.
Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved.
However, Freitas, Le Hung &amp; Siksek  proved that elliptic curves defined over real quadratic fields are modular.
