The Marquises and Dukes of Montferrat were the rulers of a territory in Piedmont south of the Po and east of Turin called Montferrat.
The March of Montferrat was created by Berengar II of Italy in 950 during a redistribution of power in the northwest of his kingdom.
It was originally named after and held by the Aleramici.
In 1574, Montferrat was raised to a Duchy by Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor .
