In Norse mythology, Skaði  is a jötunn and goddess associated with bowhunting, skiing, winter, and mountains.
Skaði is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and in Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the works of skalds.
In all sources, Skaði is the daughter of the deceased Þjazi, and Skaði married the god Njörðr as part of the compensation provided by the gods for killing her father Þjazi.
In Heimskringla, Skaði is described as having split up with Njörðr and as later having married the god Odin, and that the two produced many children together.
In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Skaði is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom onto the bound Loki.
Skaði is alternately referred to as Öndurguð  and Öndurdís .
The etymology of the name Skaði is uncertain, but may be connected with the original form of Scandinavia.
Some place names in Scandinavia, particularly in Sweden, refer to Skaði.
Scholars have theorized a potential connection between Skaði and the god Ullr , a particular relationship with the jötunn Loki, and that Scandinavia may be related to the name Skaði  or the name may be connected to an Old Norse noun meaning "harm".
Skaði has inspired various works of art.
