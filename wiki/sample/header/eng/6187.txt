BanYa , sometimes spelled BANYA or Banya, is South Korean Andamiro's musical group responsible for creating original songs for Pump It Up.
The style of its music varies greatly, from hip hop to electronic, from rock to classical crossovers.
Classical remixes are among Banya's most popular productions.
Several sonatas, symphonies and other pieces feature in different versions.
Mixing violins, guitars and heavy beats, these songs draw particular attention from players and passers-by.
BanYa also composes original music including trance, techno, hardcore and ambient breaks.
Beginning in NX, former BanYa member Yahpp became a solo artist and in turn his new music became credited to him.
Starting in Fiesta, msgoon, another former member, did the same.
All other former members, starting on NX, became credited as "BanYa Production".
