Bian Zhang , originally named Bian Yun, was an official who lived in the Eastern Han dynasty and served as the Magistrate of Xin'an County.
In 185, Beigong Boyu of the Qiang tribe rebelled in Liang Province.
Beigong Boyu took Bian Zhang and Han Sui, another Han official, hostage and stopped all attempts to return them.
Bian Zhang was forced to participate in the rebellion or else he would be killed.
He became the overall commander of the rebels, but was defeated in battle with Dong Zhuo and Sun Jian and died shortly after.
