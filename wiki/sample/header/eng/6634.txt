In 1269 AD the town was donated by King Charles I of Naples to Ranulfo de Courtenay.
In 1500, the town population was approximately 600.
At the end of the 17th century, the population was down to only around 300 inhabitants.
In the early 19th century, Bomba was the home of Bertrando and Silvio Spaventa, who were famous Italian patriots.
In the middle of the 20th century, a large dam was built over the Sangro River  that created a large artificial lake famous for its tourism and for sporting activities.
