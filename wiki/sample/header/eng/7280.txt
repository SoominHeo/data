The lira  was the currency of San Marino from the 1860s until the introduction of the euro in 2002.
It was equivalent and pegged to the Italian lira.
Italian coins and banknotes and Vatican City coins were legal tender in San Marino, while Sammarinese coins, minted in Rome, were legal tender throughout Italy, as well as in the Vatican City.
