The Shine-Dalgarno  sequence is a ribosomal binding site in bacterial and archaeal messenger RNA, generally located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG.
The RNA sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the messenger RNA  to initiate protein synthesis by aligning the ribosome with the start codon.
The Shine-Dalgarno sequence exists both in bacteria and archaea.
It is also present in some chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts.
The six-base consensus sequence is AGGAGG; in Escherichia coli, for example, the sequence is AGGAGGU, while subsequence GAGG dominates in E. coli virus T4 early genes.
[] The Shine-Dalgarno sequence was proposed by Australian scientists John Shine 
 and Lynn Dalgarno
