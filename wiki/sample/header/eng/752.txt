Hughes AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Weapon Locating System is a mobile radar system developed[] by Hughes Aircraft Company and currently manufactured by ThalesRaytheonSystems.
The system is a long-range version of “weapon-locating radar,” designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire to determine the point of origin for counter-battery fire.
It is currently in service at brigade and higher levels in the United States Army and by other countries.
The radar is trailer-mounted and towed by a 2⅓-ton truck.
A typical AN/TPQ-37 system consists of the Antenna-Transceiver Group, Command Shelter and 60 kW Generator.
