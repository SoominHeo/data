In mathematics, the counting measure is an intuitive way to put a measure on any set: the "size" of a subset is taken to be the number of elements in the subset, if the subset has finitely many elements, and ∞ if the subset is infinite.
The counting measure can be defined on any measurable set, but is mostly used on countable sets.
In formal notation, we can make any set X into a measurable space by taking the sigma-algebra 



Σ


{\displaystyle \Sigma }

 of measurable subsets to consist of all subsets of 



X


{\displaystyle X}

.
Then the counting measure 



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 on this measurable space 






{\displaystyle }

 is the positive measure 



Σ
→
[
0
,
+
∞
]


{\displaystyle \Sigma \rightarrow [0,+\infty ]}

 defined by for all 



A
∈
Σ


{\displaystyle A\in \Sigma }

, where 



|
A
|


{\displaystyle \vert A\vert }

 denotes the cardinality of the set 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.
The counting measure on 






{\displaystyle }

 is σ-finite if and only if the space 



X


{\displaystyle X}

 is countable.
The counting measure is a special case of a more general construct.



{\displaystyle f\colon X\to [0,\infty )}

 defines a measure 



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 on 






{\displaystyle }

 via where the possibly uncountable sum of real numbers is defined to be the sup of the sums over all finite subsets, i.e., Taking f=1 for all x in X produces the counting measure.
