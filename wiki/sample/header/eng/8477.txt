In physical theories, a test particle is an idealized model of an object whose physical properties  are assumed to be negligible except for the property being studied, which is considered to be insufficient to alter the behavior of the rest of the system.
The concept of a test particle often simplifies problems, and can provide a good approximation for physical phenomena.
In addition to its uses in the simplification of the dynamics of a system in particular limits, it is also used as a diagnostic in computer simulations of physical processes.
