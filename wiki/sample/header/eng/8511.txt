The shoelace formula or shoelace algorithm  is a mathematical algorithm to determine the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are described by their Cartesian coordinates in the plane.
The user cross-multiplies corresponding coordinates to find the area encompassing the polygon, and subtracts it from the surrounding polygon to find the area of the polygon within.
It is called the shoelace formula because of the constant cross-multiplying for the coordinates making up the polygon, like tying shoelaces.
It is also sometimes called the shoelace method.
It has applications in surveying and forestry, among other areas.
The formula was described by Meister  in 1769 and by Gauss in 1795.
It can be verified by dividing the polygon into triangles, but it can also be seen as a special case of Green's theorem.
The area formula is derived by taking each edge AB, and calculating the  area of triangle ABO with a vertex at the origin O, by taking the cross-product  and dividing by 2.
As one wraps around the polygon, these triangles with positive and negative area will overlap, and the areas between the origin and the polygon will be cancelled out and sum to 0, while only the area inside the reference triangle remains.
This is why the formula is called the Surveyor's Formula, since the "surveyor" is at the origin; if going counterclockwise, positive area is added when going from left to right and negative area is added when going from right to left, from the perspective of the origin.
The area formula is valid for any non-self-intersecting  polygon, which can be convex or concave.
