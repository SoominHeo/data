Hyewon pungsokdo is an album of the genre paintings  drawn by the Korean painter Shin Yunbok during the late Joseon dynasty.
It was named after Shin's pen name, Hyewon, and comprises 30 paintings in total.
In 1930, Jeon Hyeopil , later the founder of the Gansong Art Museum, purchased it from an antique dealer in Osaka, Japan and newly mounted the album.
Oh Sechang , who was a journalist and pro-independence activist, wrote the subtitles and postface for the album.
