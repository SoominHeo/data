Queen Sinjeong   was the only wife of Crown Prince Hyomyeong of Joseon and mother of king Heonjong of Joseon.
She served as nominal regent of Joseon during the minority of Gojongâ€™s reign, whom she had selected to place upon the throne, in 1864-1873, although she left all de facto power to the king's father Heungseon Daewongun and only kept the formal title as regent.
