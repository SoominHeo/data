The Artin reciprocity law, which was established by Emil Artin in a series of papers , is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory.
The term "reciprocity law" refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it generalized, from the quadratic reciprocity law and the reciprocity laws of Eisenstein and Kummer to Hilbert's product formula for the norm symbol.
Artin's result provided a partial solution to Hilbert's ninth problem.
