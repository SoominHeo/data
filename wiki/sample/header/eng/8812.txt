The Seal of the Territory of American Samoa is based in traditional local design.
The fly switch  represents wisdom and the staff  represents authority.
Both symbols are used by talking chiefs indicating their rank.
The Tanoa  represents service to the chief.
The Samoan motto Samoa Muamua Le Atua is translated “Samoa, God is First”.
