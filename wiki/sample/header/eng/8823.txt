The Ave Maria by Bach/Gounod is a popular and much-recorded setting of the Latin text Ave Maria, originally published in 1853 as Méditation sur le Premier Prélude de Piano de S. Bach.
The piece consists of a melody by the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod that he superimposed over an only very slightly changed version of the Prelude No.
1 in C major, BWV 846, from Book I of J.S.
Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, written 137 years earlier.
