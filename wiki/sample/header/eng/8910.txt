Auðumbla  is a primeval cow appearing in Norse mythology.
It is attested in Gylfaginning, a part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, in association with Ginnungagap and Ymir.
Auðumbla is not mentioned again in the Prose Edda, and apart from one mention in Nafnaþulur, its name does not occur in other ancient sources.
Nevertheless, it is generally accepted by scholars as an authentic part of Norse mythos and not dismissed as an invention of Snorri Sturluson.
