The family Apodanthaceae comprises about 10 species of endoparasitic herbs.
They live in the branches or stems of their hosts , emerging only to flower and fruit.
The plants produce no green parts and do not carry out any photosynthesis .
There are two genera: Pilostyles and Apodanthes.
A third genus, Berlinianche, was never validly published.
Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences confidently place the Apodanthaceae in the Cucurbitales, where they also fit well in terms of their flower morphology.
