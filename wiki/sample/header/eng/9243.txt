The Alidosi or Alodosi are a family of Romagna, Italy, who held the signoria of the city of Imola during the Late Middle Ages.
They were originary of the Santerno valley.
When Imola was stripped from them by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1424, they retreated to the countryside seigniory of Castel del Rio, in the Romagna Apennines, from which they were ousted in 1638 by Pope Urban VIII.
Another notable member was Cardinal Francesco Alidosi , who was a friend of Pope Julius II.
