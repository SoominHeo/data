Applesoft BASIC is a dialect of Microsoft BASIC, developed by Marc McDonald and Ric Weiland, supplied with the Apple II series of computers.
It supersedes Integer BASIC and is the BASIC in ROM in all Apple II series computers after the original Apple II model.
It is also referred to as FP BASIC  because of the Disk Operating System  command used to invoke it, instead of INT for Integer BASIC.
Applesoft BASIC was supplied by Microsoft and its name is derived from the names of both Apple and Microsoft.
Apple employees, including Randy Wigginton, adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features.
The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 only on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics.
Applesoft II, which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978.
It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences from the first as well as support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that most people mean by the term "Applesoft."
