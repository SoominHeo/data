Scott Adsit portrays Pete Hornberger</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Peter "Pete" Hornberger</b> (<a href="/wiki/Scott_Adsit" title="Scott Adsit">Scott Adsit</a>) is one of the producers of <i>TGS</i>, who often serves as a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Straight_man" title="wiktionary:Straight man">straight man</a> to the other characters. As the show goes on he slowly descends into a pathetic state of insanity. He works closely with and serves as a trusted friend to Liz, whom, as stated in "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blind_Date_(30_Rock_episode)" title="Blind Date (30 Rock episode)">Blind Date</a>", he has known for ten years.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Blind_Date_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Blind_Date-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early seasons, Pete is Liz's closest friend at work and the only one she can rely on. Much like Liz, Pete generally plays straight man to the other characters, especially to Liz when she is temporarily pushed over the edge. Prior to his work on TGS, Pete was a skilled archer qualified to compete in the 1980 Summer Olympics, but did not get to go when President Carter decided to boycott the Moscow games. Later episode stated he was a member of the band <a href="/wiki/Loverboy" title="Loverboy">Loverboy</a> during his teenage years and that his father was a member of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Pete is married and he has four sons and a daughter. Aside from a brief scene in the pilot where Pete appears at home with one of his sons, the members of his family were unseen characters until the episode "Greenzo". In one episode, Pete reveals that he is afraid of his son Kyle, who is apparently very strong and, in "Black Tie," he spoke with his son Kaleb over the telephone, pretending to be Elmo, in order to encourage his son to "aim your pee-pee at the potty." In "Greenzo", Liz mentions he has three sons named Robert and Jack, and an unnamed one referred to as "that creepy little one who's always rubbing himself on the carpet". In the episode "Anna Howard Shaw Day", his daughter Evelyn is selling cookies for a school fundraiser. His wife Paula is implied to have a rather overbearing personality and Pete often goes to great lengths to make her happy, as in "Up All Night" when he realized that it was Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife's birthday. Pete also passed when one of Tracy's entourage expressed interest in him during that episode, showing that he may not always be happy in his marriage but he remains faithful. In the episode "Tracy Does Conan," Pete stated that his wife wishes he was not bald and, in "Black Tie," Pete mentions that they were married in a botanical garden. He lied to his wife about getting a vasectomy, but, as of "The Fighting Irish," she's getting suspicious. Therefore, Pete has asked Liz for the keys to her apartment for "my own safety." He is still living with Liz as of "Greenzo." However, Liz finds out that Pete and Paula are having an "affair" where they sneak around and use her apartment for trysts that include silk scarves and Pop-Tarts; Pete tells her that he and his wife got pregnant almost immediately after they began dating and have never had an exciting romantic/sexual life because of that, so they have found this way to spark their marriage.</p>
<p>With his role of Liz's confidant increasingly filled by Jack Donaghy, Pete played increasingly reduced roles as the series continued, although his marital woes and inability to catch a break were increasingly mined for humor. Jack pities Pete for his aimlessness and unattractive appearance, and occasionally attempts to boost his confidence, beginning by convincing him to wear a wig for a week in "<a href="/wiki/Tracy_Does_Conan" title="Tracy Does Conan">Tracy Does Conan</a>." In "<a href="/wiki/Nothing_Left_to_Lose" title="Nothing Left to Lose">Nothing Left to Lose</a>", Jack is shocked to find out that Pete's only ambition is to remain in his current job. Jack attempts to help Pete by having him make adjustments to his lifestyle, including shaving off what remains of his hair. Unfortunately, it is revealed that his ring of hair was hiding an obscene birthmark that Jack describes as "a swastika made of penises", leading him to be beaten in the street and forced to wear another wig.</p>
<p>When TGS is canceled in <a href="/wiki/Last_Lunch" title="Last Lunch">Last Lunch</a>, Pete implies repeatedly he is planning to fake his death and escape from his life and family. He succeeds in doing so, setting up a new identity under the name "Dan Silversmith" in <a href="/wiki/Hickory,_North_Carolina" title="Hickory, North Carolina">Hickory, North Carolina</a>, but is tracked down a year later by his wife Paula and meekly returns to his previous existence.</p>

Judah Friedlander portrays Frank Rossitano</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Francis "Frank" Rossitano</b> (<a href="/wiki/Judah_Friedlander" title="Judah Friedlander">Judah Friedlander</a>; <a href="/wiki/Fred_Armisen" title="Fred Armisen">Fred Armisen</a> in select scenes of "<a href="/wiki/Live_from_Studio_6H" title="Live from Studio 6H">Live from Studio 6H</a>") is a writer at TGS of Sicilian descent. After Liz, Frank is the most prominently-featured and prolific writer of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Show-within-a-show" title="Show-within-a-show">show-within-a-show</a>. Frank is habitually slovenly and childish; he lives with his mother and is an aficionado of video games, comic books and figurines, and pornography. He wears a variety of <a href="/wiki/Trucker_hat" title="Trucker hat">trucker hats</a> with humorous phrases (which Friedlander also wears in real life) and large, thick-lensed glasses. Frank delivers most lines in a deadpan style, and is often shown to be something of a perverse character with an obvious interest in the opposite gender (although in one episode Frank questions his sexuality after meeting a physically attractive man named Jamie), Frank appears to have an understanding of popular culture and sometimes displays surprising amounts of intelligence. Frank is <a href="/wiki/Peanut_allergy" title="Peanut allergy">allergic to peanuts</a>. In "<a href="/wiki/Audition_Day" title="Audition Day">Audition Day</a>" it is revealed that he is a standup comedian.</p>
<p>Friedlander says he makes the hats for his character himself, using phrases he invents;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> in episode S03E18 where Liz is forced to stay home, one of her final requests before being forced out of the building was to know what Frank's hat said. Frank first started wearing the hats at age 14; his eighth-grade class photo shows him in a hat reading "My First Hat".</p>
<p>Frank was raised largely by his mother Sylvia after his father, a lawyer for the mafia, went into the Witness Protection Program. Sylvia's fear for her son led him to leave law school at her insistence and enter comedy. In "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_My_Friend" title="Goodbye, My Friend">Goodbye, My Friend</a>," Jack Donaghy learns of Frank's legal aspirations and offers him a scholarship to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Columbia_University_Law_School" title="Columbia University Law School">Columbia University Law School</a>, but reneges on his offer after Sylvia warns him of the danger in which a law career would place Frank due to his family's mafia connections. Frank pursues women frequently, usually older, psychologically damaged, or physically unattractive women he considers "low-hanging fruit". Though it is hinted in the episode "Jackie Jormp Jomp" that him and Cerie have a secret relationship. The great love of Frank's life occurred at the age of 14, where he had an affair with his middle-school teacher, Lynn Onkmann. She was sent to prison for the offense, but he remained in love with her and after her release in the 5th Season of 30 Rock, they reconciled and began a relationship over the objections of pretty much everyone else.</p>

Katrina Bowden portrays Cerie</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cerie Xerox</b> (<a href="/wiki/Katrina_Bowden" title="Katrina Bowden">Katrina Bowden</a>) is Liz's young, pretty, laid-back assistant. She is an object of intense sexual desire for the male writers of <i>TGS</i> because of her beauty and very revealing clothing. However, she seems to be unaware of the effect she has on men, believing that the reason Liz does not approve of the way she dresses is because Liz has "one of those body image things". She frequently receives drunken phone sex messages, and she states that she does not think that they are cute, even when they are from Liz.</p>
<p>In "<a href="/wiki/Jack_the_Writer" title="Jack the Writer">Jack the Writer</a>", she tells Liz that her goal in life is to "marry rich and then design handbags." She seems to be very successful because of her charm and good looks and is the object of insults from insecure women. Despite her appearance and unawareness, Cerie has proved herself to be intelligent on multiple occasions, usually with ironic comedy.</p>
<p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_Baby_Show" title="The Baby Show">The Baby Show</a>", Cerie becomes engaged to a wealthy man named Aris, after dating him for five weeks. When Liz tells Cerie that she may be rushing into marriage, Cerie replies that she would only be able to be a "young hot mom" for a limited time, and that she didn't want to be "like... 50" when her children graduate from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_school" title="High school">high school</a>. If their first child is a girl, possible names include "Bookcase", "Sandstorm", and "Hat", though Cerie thinks "Hat" is "more of a boy's name". In "<a href="/wiki/Up_All_Night_(30_Rock)" title="Up All Night (30 Rock)">Up All Night</a>," she stated that she and Aris were fighting because he wants a <a href="/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" title="Greek Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a> wedding and she disagrees with the Church's <a href="/wiki/Cyprus_dispute" title="Cyprus dispute">stance on Cyprus</a>; soon after, he is kidnapped by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Somali_pirates" title="Somali pirates">Somali pirates</a>.

<p><b>Jonathan</b> (<a href="/wiki/Maulik_Pancholy" title="Maulik Pancholy">Maulik Pancholy</a>) is Jack's assistant. Jonathan harbours a desperate crush on Jack.

<p><b>Johnny "J. D." Lutz</b> (<a href="/wiki/John_Lutz" title="John Lutz">John Lutz</a>) is a lazy, overweight <i>TGS</i> writer who is often ridiculed by the rest of the staff. When characters enter the room they sometimes yell, "Shut up, Lutz!" even if Lutz was not speaking at the time. The other characters are unconcerned about his well-being; when Lutz ran headfirst into a wall in "<a href="/wiki/The_Ones_(30_Rock)" title="The Ones (30 Rock)">The Ones</a>", no one helped him until a wall-mounted television fell on him, and even then, Pete (the producer) tells the writers, who instigated the incident, "I hope you've learned your lesson. Because of what you did, we almost lost a monitor." Lutz is originally from <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> (which he hates), and is part <a href="/wiki/Inuit" title="Inuit">Inuit</a>.

The show implies that he is a gay man in the process of coming out, although everyone ignores (or forgets) this due to their dislike of him. Lutz periodically mentions a girlfriend who lives in Canada, named Karen. No one believes him; therefore, Lutz created a website (<a class="external text" href="http://jdlutz.com/karen/proof/" rel="nofollow">JDLutz.com/karen/proof</a>—an actual page on the <i>30 Rock</i> website). He finally identifies himself as bisexual while shouting at his fellow writers on their last day of work in "<a href="/wiki/Last_Lunch" title="Last Lunch">Last Lunch</a>".

<p><b>Josh Girard</b> (<a href="/wiki/Lonny_Ross" title="Lonny Ross">Lonny Ross</a>) was the male star of <i>TGS</i> before Tracy was hired. Liz found him while he was opening for a puppet. He, Tracy, and Jenna Maroney are the three main actors on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Show-within-a-show" title="Show-within-a-show">show-within-a-show</a> from Seasons 1 through 3. It has been said<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (September 2014)">by whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> that his character is based on <i>SNL</i> alumnus <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon" title="Jimmy Fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a>. Josh is frequently seen in the writer's room, and appears to be the only member of the TGS cast who also works as a writer for the show. Often referred to as being a "kid," Josh is described in dialogue in a way that implies he is young, guileless, and unintelligent. He is indeed typically portrayed as lacking smarts and is often shown doing things that are considered juvenile.</p>
<p>Most of Josh's work on the show seems to be as an impressionist; he has performed impressions of <a href="/wiki/Ray_Romano" title="Ray Romano">Ray Romano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jackson" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stone_Phillips" title="Stone Phillips">Stone Phillips</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jay_Leno" title="Jay Leno">Jay Leno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>.</p>
<p>His impressions have raised eyebrows from people who are not impressed, like Elizabeth Taylor (played by <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Dratch" title="Rachel Dratch">Rachel Dratch</a>), who knocked him out with an extinguisher and leaving him severely concussed after he did a sketch that offended her in which he impersonated the actress. Original characters that he plays on the show include "Dr. Ridiculous," a Chinese man named Mr. Wang, and Gaybraham Lincoln. In "<a href="/wiki/The_Baby_Show" title="The Baby Show">The Baby Show</a>," Tracy got mad at Josh for impersonating him, claiming that Josh was turning him into a caricature. In "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hard_Ball_(30_Rock)" title="Hard Ball (30 Rock)">Hard Ball</a>," it is implied that Josh is Jewish, and in a carry-over during "<a href="/wiki/Ludachristmas" title="Ludachristmas">Ludachristmas</a>," from the "Secret Rodney" ads that were running, Kenneth says "Merry Jewish" to Josh when passing out gifts. He, Frank, and Toofer are often observed fooling around and admiring Cerie.</p>
<p>In the episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Break-Up_(30_Rock)" title="The Break-Up (30 Rock)">The Break-Up</a>," Josh states that his parents raised him as a girl for 10 years. Jack Donaghy mentions in the show's second episode that Josh had a 760 SAT score and graduated from <a href="/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_at_Cortland" title="State University of New York at Cortland">SUNY Cortland</a>. In "Hard Ball," Josh's agent Alan Steiner is introduced. In sharp contrast to Josh, Steiner was portrayed as slick and cunning. Steiner uses unnecessary abbreviations and has a "really bad sex addiction."</p>
<p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_Rural_Juror" title="The Rural Juror">The Rural Juror</a>," Josh snuck into Liz's office to get her copy of <i>The Rural Juror</i> and quickly dislikes it upon seeing the title ("Well, this is disappointing...I had to let Tony [the security guard] watch me pee to get that tape").</p>
<p>In "<a href="/wiki/Season_4_(30_Rock)" title="Season 4 (30 Rock)">Season 4</a>," Josh gets fed up with everyone's poor treatment of him and quits <i>TGS</i>. He then winds up auditioning again in "<a href="/wiki/Audition_Day" title="Audition Day">Audition Day</a>," but he gets rejected; Danny Baker replaces him in the main <i>TGS</i> cast. Lonny Ross was written out of the series in season four. He does appear via a flashback to a raunchy TGS sketch with Tracy in the series finale.</p>

<p>Danny is earnest, good-natured, and a talented singer.

In a 2008 interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</a></i> magazine, Tina Fey said that Banks' character was based on former co-chairman of NBC Entertainment <a href="/wiki/Ben_Silverman" title="Ben Silverman">Ben Silverman</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Devon is the nemesis of the (older) <a href="/wiki/Jack_Donaghy" title="Jack Donaghy">Jack Donaghy</a>; he is first seen in "<a href="/wiki/Fireworks_(30_Rock)" title="Fireworks (30 Rock)">Fireworks</a>", when his surprise visit from <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> leads Jack to believe that he is trying to take Jack's job as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming. Devon is gay, but for a point, was closeted as he becomes engaged to Kathy Geiss in order to get ahead in the company. Devon lusts after <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Parcell" title="Kenneth Parcell">Kenneth Parcell</a> and uses his status as a former <a href="/wiki/NBC_page" title="NBC page">NBC page</a> himself to ingratiate himself with Kenneth. Jack, however, uses Kenneth as a honey trap to spy on and distract Devon. After the events of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Do-Over_(30_Rock)" title="Do-Over (30 Rock)">"Do-Over"</a>, he leaves Kathy and winds up showing up again in "<a href="/wiki/Into_the_Crevasse" title="Into the Crevasse">Into the Crevasse</a>" working for the Obama administration, and attempts to make Jack take government bail-out money, which Jack eventually does with reluctance. He appears again in Season 5's <a href="/wiki/Plan_B_(30_Rock)" title="Plan B (30 Rock)">"Plan B"</a>, married and the father of three "gaybies" whom he and his partner Cashmere had via a surrogate mother. He briefly attempts to compete with Jack for the CEO position of Kabletown, but learns to treasure family more, and officially admits defeat to Jack. He returns in "<a href="/wiki/Idiots_Are_People_Three!" title="Idiots Are People Three!">Idiots Are People Three!</a>" and manipulates Jack into using his connections to get his children into an elite preschool, but his joy that Jack won't be able to do that for his own daughter vanishes as Jack smugly notes that Liddy is already brilliant and doesn't need any artificial help. Banks appears again in Season 7's "Game Over" as part of Kaylie Hooper's ploy to wrangle control of Kabletown away from Jack.</p>

<p><b>Kaylie Hooper</b> (<a href="/wiki/Chlo%C3%AB_Grace_Moretz" title="Chloë Grace Moretz">Chloë Grace Moretz</a>) is the granddaughter of Hank Hooper, who is in competition with Jack to take over her grandfather's role as CEO of Kabletown. First introduced in "<a href="/wiki/TGS_Hates_Women" title="TGS Hates Women">TGS Hates Women</a>", she has twice used typical teenage girl antics to try to cover up her schemes to bring down Jack. Initially, she pretended to be interested in oceanography and later threatened to destroy Jack if he interfered with her future at Kabletown. Later on, she deliberately sabotaged an NBC reality show with singing kids as part of a convoluted plot to make sure Jack got her expelled from a private school she hated, thus landing her a spot at a school in Manhattan with her NYU student boyfriend—but Jack got the last laugh, as he ruined her dreams of playing lacrosse there and she couldn't pretend he hadn't won that round. Kaylie returns in "<a href="/wiki/Game_Over_(30_Rock)" title="Game Over (30 Rock)">Game Over</a>", still wanting to be CEO of Kabletown. In this episode, it is apparently revealed that she is not Hank's granddaughter and Jack plans to expose her. In reality, she is Hank's granddaughter and that she deliberately set up Jack to try to make him send her DNA to Hank when he actually sent him someone else's DNA, using Devon as a pawn in her plan. However, Jack revealed that he never sent Hank her DNA but instead a birthday card for Hank, something that Hank is very passionate about and something that Kaylie did not do due to being distracted by Jack throughout the whole week, sealing Jack's fate as Kabletown CEO and Kaylie's ultimate downfall.</p>

Kristen Schaal portrays Hazel Wassername</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Hazel Wassername,</b> aka Richard Drench (<a href="/wiki/Kristen_Schaal" title="Kristen Schaal">Kristen Schaal</a>) replaces Kenneth as an NBC page when he is promoted to Standards and Practice. At first, she stalked Liz and deeply despised Jenna, having nearly succeeded in her efforts to maim or kill her and therefore become Liz's "best friend". In "<a href="/wiki/What_Will_Happen_to_the_Gang_Next_Year%3F" title="What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?">What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?</a>" it is revealed that she sees Kenneth as a threat, and rewrites his reapplication to the page program in a way that causes him to not receive the job. She also moves in with him in the same episode, and while her claim that she's "in love" with him appears to be false, she is the only woman he has ever been seen kissing on the show. She previously had a relationship with a pimp named Razmig, and has some disturbing sexual notions. She is a recurring character, beginning in season six. In "<a href="/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day_(30_Rock)" title="St. Patrick's Day (30 Rock)">St. Patrick's Day</a>", she reveals that she left her kids in a <a href="/wiki/Sears" title="Sears">Sears</a> in 2004 and has an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IQ" title="IQ">IQ</a> of 70, though considering her penchant for lying and exaggeration, it is possible that these claims are both false. She was later fired by Liz for attempting to trick Pete into letting her perform on TGS. Before leaving, she reveals that Hazel Wassername is not her real name. Following her departure, Hazel breaks up with Kenneth. In "<a href="/wiki/My_Whole_Life_Is_Thunder" title="My Whole Life Is Thunder">My Whole Life Is Thunder</a>", Hazel is "recast" by Tracy as a young Asian woman (Shannon Tyo) in an attempt to cheer Kenneth up.</p>
<p>After leaving NBC, Wassername sues parent company Kabletown alleging to have been the victim of sexual harassment in "<a href="/wiki/Florida_(30_Rock)" title="Florida (30 Rock)">Florida</a>". Although her claims make her look worse than any of her co-workers, she accurately recounts how badly everyone treats Kenneth; when Jenna and Tracy tell him to be honest, he confirms those incidents (though he isn't that upset about them) and the bad publicity leads Hank Hooper to finally cancel TGS.</p>

Dean Winters portrays Dennis Duffy</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Dennis Duffy</b> (<a href="/wiki/Dean_Winters" title="Dean Winters">Dean Winters</a>) was Liz's <a href="/wiki/Boyfriend" title="Boyfriend">boyfriend</a> for three episodes during the early part of the show's first season; he has also made appearances in each subsequent season. Liz had a relationship with him that ended prior to the series, and she briefly resumes a relationship with him only to break it off after discovering that he has been featured on <i><a href="/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator" title="To Catch a Predator">To Catch a Predator</a></i>. (Dennis later claimed that he knew the girl was actually eighteen because, "She said her last boyfriend was Asian, and that crap doesn't start 'till college.") Dennis has popped up occasionally in later seasons to annoy Liz and attempt to get back together. He is generally disliked by most of the characters, most notably by Liz, Jack and Jenna, with whom he once had sex behind Liz's back.</p>
<p>Dennis claims to be the love of Liz's life, which she disputes. The few good memories she has of him are mostly food-related, but she admits he makes her laugh. His nickname for her is "Dummy." She nearly got engaged to him and signed a lease on an apartment in Jacksonville before Jack Donaghy got over a pointless feud with Liz and stopped that. In his last two appearances on the show, Dennis has married an obnoxious Irish-American woman named Megan (whose maiden name is also Duffy) and they have adopted an African-American baby boy whom they call "Black Dennis". While Dennis is worthless, he did inspire Liz to finally declare her love for her new boyfriend Criss Chros and, later, to marry him.</p>
<p>Dennis is immature for a man his age, often exclaiming like a teenage boy. In one episode he sits on Liz's bed, playing <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_3" title="Halo 3">Halo 3</a></i>; then, he throws the controller down and yells that the controller is "defective" because "that grenade was right next to him!" He was the last remaining <a href="/wiki/Pager" title="Pager">beeper</a> salesman in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and was known as the "Beeper King" (after the original Beeper King committed suicide). His other plans are similarly moronic, including a make-your-own coffee station, copying DVD movies onto <a href="/wiki/LaserDisc" title="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, and the participation in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Balloon_Boy" title="Balloon Boy">Balloon Boy</a>-like stunt after being assigned to a program that pairs talented kids with troubled adults. In his final appearance, he brags that he has found success selling "suicide insurance". In the episode "<a href="/wiki/100_(30_Rock)" title="100 (30 Rock)">100</a>", it is revealed that his ancestors were kicked out of Ireland, then kicked out of America, sent back to Ireland, then set adrift on a log.</p>

Jon Hamm portrays Drew Baird</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Dr. Andrew "Drew" Baird</b> (<a href="/wiki/Jon_Hamm" title="Jon Hamm">Jon Hamm</a>) is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pediatrician" title="Pediatrician">pediatrician</a> and Liz's very handsome neighbor. He graduated from <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons" title="Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons">Columbia University medical school</a>; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a> used a photo of him from his high school swim team as a model for Prince Eric in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)" title="The Little Mermaid (1989 film)">The Little Mermaid</a></i>. His name is a play on <a href="/wiki/Drew_Pinsky" title="Drew Pinsky">Dr. Drew</a>. He first appears in season three episode "<a href="/wiki/Generalissimo_(30_Rock)" title="Generalissimo (30 Rock)">Generalissimo</a>", when Liz accidentally receives his mail. After going through the contents (which includes a warranty for his ice cream maker and his <a href="/wiki/Netflix" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> rentals: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Muppets_Take_Manhattan" title="The Muppets Take Manhattan">The Muppets Take Manhattan</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Caddyshack" title="Caddyshack">Caddyshack</a></i>, and a documentary on how pies are made), Liz decides he is perfect for her and creates a false persona so he will like her. Liz's scheme unravels, and Drew is disappointed in her; however, he reads her mail and tells her he feels Liz would have been someone he would have wanted to know. Eventually, they agree upon a fresh start.</p>
<p>He is recently divorced from Mandy and has one daughter from the marriage (Bethany, a rebellious teenager who drinks wine and starts fires). Liz and Drew's first date was on <a href="/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> 2009, during which Bethany ended up at Liz's apartment and Drew's mother died in the hospital. On her deathbed she reveals to Liz that she is not actually Drew's mother; the person Drew thinks is his sister is, in fact, his mother. She asks Liz to tell him the truth and Liz reveals this to Drew later in the episode.</p>
<p>In episode 15 of season three, ("<a href="/wiki/The_Bubble_(30_Rock)" title="The Bubble (30 Rock)">The Bubble</a>"), Liz is concerned about the way others treat Drew; he is so handsome that he unintentionally causes others to fawn over him. He was a professional tennis player in college even though he is terrible at it. Despite being horrible at everything from cooking to sex to not knowing how to perform the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heimlich_maneuver" title="Heimlich maneuver">Heimlich maneuver</a>, no one tells him the truth because he is so good-looking. <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Klein" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a> (in a cameo) stops him on the street and asks him to be an underwear model. He never has to wait in line at restaurants; when Liz (blocking Drew's face from view) orders his request off the menu and is berated by the waitress, he is mystified by her response and wonders where their complementary appetizer sampler is. Jack, having firsthand knowledge of the situation from his younger days, describes this as "The Bubble." Liz tells Drew that he receives constant special treatment, and when Liz stops letting him win at tennis, he realizes that he is actually very dimwitted and clumsy, lashing out at her. Eventually he apologizes for his behavior but prefers living in "The Bubble" to reality, asking Liz if she wants to take a ride with him on his new motorcycle. Liz declines and Drew rides into the sunset, careening incompetently down the street.</p>
<p>When Liz goes back to her ex-boyfriends in "<a href="/wiki/Emanuelle_Goes_to_Dinosaur_Land" title="Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land">Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land</a>", Drew appears with hooks on both hands: one hand had been lost in a New Year's firework explosion and the other in a helicopter accident, both caused by his stupidity. Drew later reappears in a cameo in season five episode <a href="/wiki/Live_Show" title="Live Show">Live Show</a>, having received one replacement hand from a <a href="/wiki/Death_row" title="Death row">death row</a> inmate. The hand has a mind of its own, however, and begins to strangle him (In the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">West Coast</a> version of "Live Show", Drew received a female hand transplant that constantly tries to seduce him). Liz later sums up Drew in the phrase "So handsome...so, so stupid."</p>

Michael Sheen portrays Wesley Snipes, an Englishman</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Wesley Snipes</b> (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Sheen" title="Michael Sheen">Michael Sheen</a>) is an Englishman whom Liz meets at her dentist's office while recovering from a root canal operation. Being under the effects of <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a>, they seem to hit it off and list each other in their phones as "Future Husband" and "Future Wife". When sober, they immediately realize that they have nothing in common and dislike each other intensely. However, when they keep meeting each other by chance around the city, they continue to date believing that it is their destiny to "settle" for one another.</p>
<p>Wesley is displeased that the actor <a href="/wiki/Wesley_Snipes" title="Wesley Snipes">Wesley Snipes</a> has his name, saying that the name is better suited to a "pasty, un-athletic British man". He frequently uses (fictional) <a href="/wiki/British_English" title="British English">British English</a> phrases, such as "foot cycle" for <a href="/wiki/Bicycle" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> and "film pod" for <a href="/wiki/Video_camera" title="Video camera">video camera</a>, which annoys Liz. He is rude to her, mocking her disastrous romantic history and at one point compares her life to a "<a href="/wiki/Cathy" title="Cathy">Cathy</a> cartoon that just won't end".</p>
<p>He believes they are "settling soul mates" and sets the stage for another meeting during "Sweeps", which Liz assumes refers to <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_ratings#Sweeps" title="Nielsen ratings">television sweeps week</a>, but which he claims is what the British call <a href="/wiki/Spring_cleaning" title="Spring cleaning">spring cleaning</a>. After a tour of her abysmal past relationships, she decides Wesley is her only alternative and reluctantly agrees to get engaged to him. However, in the Season 4 finale Liz meets a pilot, Carol (<a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a>), whom she likes a lot and sends Wesley a break-up text. He stupidly thinks they're getting past their first fight, but Liz tells him she's realized after meeting Carol that she can do much better than Wesley, and says goodbye to him. He leaves the room in defeat and has not been seen since. In a Season 6 episode, a flashback scene has Liz outright telling her tax accountant "I'm having a go at cycling thanks to my boyfriend Wesley, whom I hate."</p>

<p><b>Astronaut Mike Dexter</b> (John Anderson) is Liz's fantasy boyfriend, to whom she compares all other men; Mike often appears when Liz is either alone or involved in disastrous relationships, and is no longer seen once she develops a (relatively) normal social life. Liz mentions Dexter in several episodes, and he appears in her imagination throughout <a href="/wiki/30_Rock_(season_4)" title="30 Rock (season 4)">Season 4</a>. In a fantasy sequence in "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dealbreakers_Talk_Show#0001" title="Dealbreakers Talk Show">Dealbreakers Talk Show#0001</a>," Dexter tells Liz he has to go back to space, but "enjoyed the kissing followed by [his] genuine interest in that TV dance competition". In "<a href="/wiki/The_Moms" title="The Moms">The Moms</a>", Liz reveals that Astronaut Mike Dexter is also (secretly) king of Monaco. Liz meets an attorney named Mike (also played by Anderson) at <a href="/wiki/List_of_30_Rock_characters#Floyd_DeBarber" title="List of 30 Rock characters">Floyd</a>'s wedding in "<a href="/wiki/Emanuelle_Goes_to_Dinosaur_Land" title="Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land">Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land</a>"; this Mike describes himself as a "<a href="/wiki/Plushophilia" title="Plushophilia">plushie</a>" who enjoys having sex ("<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yiff" title="Yiff">yiffing</a>") with people in mascot costumes at state parks. Anderson also appears, as a nod to Liz's fantasies of Dexter, in an episode of Jack's "Porn for Women" (which features handsome men asking women about their day), which Liz buys. ("<a href="/wiki/Don_Geiss,_America_and_Hope" title="Don Geiss, America and Hope">Don Geiss, America and Hope</a>")</p>

Carol, however, is eager to settle down and pursue a more normal relationship, since every relationship he has had as an airline pilot were intermittent affairs due to his constant travel for work.</p>

James Marsden portrays Criss Chros</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Crisstopher Rick Chros</b> (<a href="/wiki/James_Marsden" title="James Marsden">James Marsden</a>) is an unemployed entrepreneur, and like <a href="#Dot_Com">Dot Com</a>, attended <a href="/wiki/Wesleyan_University" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a>. He dropped out of law school, but holds a degree in ethnomusicology. He and Liz met somewhere between the end of season five and the beginning of season 6 at Riverside Park after Liz made fun of his turtleneck shirt. He runs a hot dog stand which sells organic hot dogs. It is revealed that he and Liz are dating in "<a href="/wiki/Idiots_Are_People_Two!" title="Idiots Are People Two!">Idiots Are People Two!</a>" and that Liz has kept it a secret from Jack because she fears he'll disapprove of Criss - which Jack does, at first, but winds up changing his mind and gives Criss his "probational approval" card in "<a href="/wiki/Idiots_Are_People_Three!" title="Idiots Are People Three!">Idiots Are People Three!</a>" In "<a href="/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day_(30_Rock)" title="St. Patrick's Day (30 Rock)">St. Patrick's Day</a>", a surprise visit from <a href="#Dennis_Duffy">Dennis</a> makes Liz finally admit that she is in love with Criss after an argument. When she tells him that she loves him, something she has never done to anyone, Criss responds by quoting <a href="/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>'s response to <a href="/wiki/Princess_Leia" title="Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a>, "I know," thereby proving his suitability to the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i>-obsessed Liz.</p>
<p>Jack sets up Liz on a "blind date" with Kevin, a man Jack actually hates, but his true purpose is to introduce Liz to Kevin's "awesome" Lemon-esque young daughter (Bebe Wood). After realizing that having children might be a good thing, Criss and Liz subsequently "put a pin" in this idea and decide to "just have some fun". Still, Criss is insecure in their relationship, believing that Liz might eventually bail on him. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/What_Will_Happen_to_the_Gang_Next_Year%3F" title="What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?">What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?</a>", Criss sells his hot dog van to help pay for renovating Liz's apartment. Unfortunately he sells the van to "a really nice young guy on meth", who later steals money from a bank. Liz sees what she thinks is still Criss's van on a TV news report on the robbery, and thinking that Criss stole the money, tells him she will go to prison in his place. Criss considers this a sign that Liz will not bail on him, and later in the episode, when Liz observes that the room Criss is renovating will make a great nursery, they both realize that they are ready to try for a baby, whether biological or adopted.</p>
<p>As of Season 7, he and Liz are actively trying to have a child. Liz's unusual libido starts to make things a bit difficult, but they eventually find what works for them both. After a failed pregnancy test, Liz and Criss decide to get married in order to make an adoption process easier. They are married in a brief ceremony at City Hall attended by Jack, Dennis Duffy and his family, two homeless men and <a href="/wiki/Tony_Bennett" title="Tony Bennett">Tony Bennett</a>.</p>
<p>Liz and Criss eventually adopt a pair of elementary-school aged twins, Janet and Terry (who are highly reminiscent of Tracy and Jenna). Criss briefly goes to work as a dental receptionist, but discovers he much prefers being a stay-at-home father.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Gretchen Thomas</b> (<a href="/wiki/Stephanie_March" title="Stephanie March">Stephanie March</a>) is a "brilliant plastics engineer / lesbian" and a friend of Jack Donaghy from his rotation in General Electric's plastics division. Assuming Liz to be bisexual if not a lesbian (and maintaining that her shoes are "definitely bi-curious"), Jack sets up the pair on a blind date in "<a href="/wiki/Blind_Date_(30_Rock)" title="Blind Date (30 Rock)">Blind Date</a>". When proposing the idea to Liz, Jack refers to her simply as 'Thomas' (much as he generally addresses Liz by her surname, Lemon), and Liz is thus unaware of Gretchen's gender until meeting her. Despite Liz's lack of sexual attraction toward Gretchen, the two bond over dinner and Gretchen informs Jack that she finds Liz "great" and thinks she looks like <a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh" title="Jennifer Jason Leigh">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>. They enjoy a succession of platonic dates until Gretchen expresses that she feels she is starting to chase the straight girl and decides they should stop seeing each other. Liz attempts to make a pact that they get back together after 25 years and start a relationship then if they are both still single (including an offer to let Gretchen "do stuff to [her]" as long as Liz is not expected to reciprocate), but Gretchen walks away.</li>
<li><b>Gray</b> (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Hermann_(actor)" title="Peter Hermann (actor)">Peter Hermann</a>) appears in a season one episode as a tall, handsome and well-coiffed stranger Jenna and Liz keep bumping into at the 30 Rock building and refer to as "The Hair." When Liz and Gray finally meet, they trade witty banter and discover they share similar likes and annoyances. Although they seem to click, Liz cannot escape the feeling that their disparate levels of attractiveness make her unworthy to be with him. During a date that begins to turn romantic at Gray's apartment, Liz spots a photo of a mutual relative and they realize to their dismay that they're actually distant cousins. Liz shuts it down but before she leaves, Gray assures her that she is also a "hair."</li>
<li><b>Steven Black</b> (<a href="/wiki/Wayne_Brady" title="Wayne Brady">Wayne Brady</a>) was Tracy's manager during season one. He briefly dated Liz during "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Source_Awards" title="The Source Awards">The Source Awards</a>", but Liz realized that they were incompatible after one date. When she attempted to break things off, Steven claimed that she was racist. Liz continued to date Steven, hoping he would see their incompatibility for himself. At the Source Awards Liz accidentally fired Tracy Jordan's gun, hitting Steven in the upper thigh while he was trying to get his phone out of her purse. This brought their relationship to an end. Wayne Brady exists in the <i>30 Rock</i> universe independently of Steven Black, having been mentioned on the show, most notably in the season-one episode "<a href="/wiki/Jack_Meets_Dennis" title="Jack Meets Dennis">Jack Meets Dennis</a>" in which Liz remarks that Tracy stole a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Choice_Award" title="People's Choice Award">People's Choice Award</a> from him.</li>
<li><b>Jamie Hamilton</b> or "The Coffee Guy" (<a href="/wiki/Val_Emmich" title="Val Emmich">Val Emmich</a>), who only appears in "<a href="/wiki/Cougars_(30_Rock)" title="Cougars (30 Rock)">Cougars</a>," is an attractive younger man who has a crush on Liz Lemon, to whom he delivers coffee. Jamie refers to Liz as the "Sexy Librarian." As the two start to develop feelings for each other, Frank admits that he also has feelings for Jamie. Jamie asks Liz out on a date, but Liz refuses to go due to the difference in their ages. She asks Jamie how old he thinks she is and Jamie guesses 29. Liz quickly lies about her age and agrees that she is definitely 29. Jamie also lies about his age, telling Liz that he's 25, convincing Liz to consider the date. On their date, Liz admits that she's actually 37, whereupon Jamie reveals that he's in fact only 20. Jenna tells Liz that they're <a href="/wiki/Cougar_(slang)" title="Cougar (slang)">cougars</a>. Liz becomes used to the idea of dating a much younger man and agrees to try it out. However, on a subsequent date, she meets Jamie's mother, Beth, who, in addition to sharing her proper forename (Elizabeth), bears a startling resemblance to Liz in looks and dress (indeed, portrayed by Tina Fey's lighting stand-in, Laura Berrios). Seeing Jamie next to Beth, Liz remarks under her breath, "Yup, that's what we look like." She immediately leaves and says "shut it down," ending their relationship.</li>
<li><b>Stewart LaGrange</b> (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Dinklage" title="Peter Dinklage">Peter Dinklage</a>) is a diplomatic attaché who works at the United Nations, whom Liz encountered in the episode "<a href="/wiki/Se%C3%B1or_Macho_Solo" title="Señor Macho Solo">Señor Macho Solo</a>" after rubbing on his head from behind while "baby crazy", having mistaken him for a child due to his <a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarfism</a>. Stewart develops an interest in her due to assuming that her action was an aggressive form of flirting, and takes her out on several dates, while Liz, despite finding him charming, feels mildly uncomfortable due to the circumstances of their meeting. She inadvertently reveals her mistake when she instinctively pulls him back from a fire, offending him greatly. Liz later calls to apologize and suggests a meeting at the Brooklyn Bridge to see if they're willing to try again. However, Liz ends up mistaking a small child for Stewart, who witnesses it and turns away saying "shut it down".</li>
<li><b>Gavin Volure</b> (<a href="/wiki/Steve_Martin" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a>) is a rich entrepreneur and owner of a company called "Sunstream". Volure is agoraphobic, which leaves him confined to his Connecticut estate. Liz becomes interested in a relationship with Gavin when she discovers that his agoraphobia would prevent them from being intimate, something that Liz desires. Gavin later reveals to Liz that he is not agoraphobic, but is really under house arrest for arson, tax fraud, embezzlement and racketeering.

Upon meeting them at the airport, Liz muses happily that gaining miniature versions of her two 'problem children' just as <i>TGS</i> is cancelled "seems about right" and she embraces the pair.</p>
<p>Their bedrooms are on second story of the family's condominium, Apartment 3B, 160 <a href="/wiki/Riverside_Drive_(Manhattan)" title="Riverside Drive (Manhattan)">Riverside Drive</a>, Liz having purchased the two apartments with her <i>Dealbreakers</i> earnings in "<a href="/wiki/Sun_Tea_(30_Rock)" title="Sun Tea (30 Rock)">Sun Tea</a>", and Criss having performed much of the work to renovate the former Apartment 4B into their second floor.

After a year in the Lemon-Chros family, Terry and Janet appear to have become less like Tracy and Jenna; they are well-behaved on-set, sitting quietly off-camera and studying their homework while their mother and Dot Com produce the show.</p>
<p>Despite the pair having not joined the family until well into their childhood, Terry (if not Janet as well) is implied to have eventually taken their new mother's (not their new father's) surname, as Liz's mixed-race great-granddaughter is named Eliza Lemon in "<a href="/wiki/Last_Lunch" title="Last Lunch">Last Lunch</a>".</p>

Elaine Stritch portrays Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Colleen Donaghy (née Murphy)</b> (<a href="/wiki/Elaine_Stritch" title="Elaine Stritch">Elaine Stritch</a>) is Jack's overbearing, demanding mother who lives in a <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> retirement home. According to Jack, the Murphy family are "a bunch of mud farmers and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bestiality" title="Bestiality">sheep rapists</a>".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> He appears as if he wants nothing to do with her although deep down, he loves her. Colleen first appeared in season 1, episode 21; she is critical of Jack's abilities, and hesitant to show him affection. In season 3, episode 20, Colleen reveals that her ex-husband (Jim Donaghy) left her in 1957 and returned in 1959. Jack was conceived in 1958 during Colleen's affair with <a href="#Milton_Greene">Milton Greene</a>.</p>
<p>Colleen has nagged Jack his whole life,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> even blaming him for <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F.

When Jack's collie, Pop, was accidentally run over by the postman, Colleen left him to die in the street. She even tried to send Jack to <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a> when he was 12 years old in order to make a man out of him. Colleen embarrassed him by having him play "<a href="/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner" title="The Star-Spangled Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>" on his flute in front of his hockey team.</p>
<p>Colleen's cold and stern demeanor is contrasted by her behavior at Christmas. After Jim abandoned the family, Colleen would acquire mountains of toys for her children each Christmas, despite the family's poverty, by in exchange for providing sexual favors to the [fictional] <a href="/wiki/FAO_Schwarz" title="FAO Schwarz">Frederick August Otto Schwarz, III</a>. Unaware of the transaction, Jack resented his mother hosting Mr. Schwartz and her infidelity toward his father. Colleen additionally gave her children unique Christmas traditions and fables that Jack assumed were standard holiday practice, such as Mrs. Claus hanging the children's stockings. He is in his 50s when Liz Lemon causes him to realize the truth and gain a new appreciation and love for his mother and her holiday practices.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-episode_Christmas_Special_34-1"><a href="#cite_note-episode_Christmas_Special-34">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite rarely having a good thing to say about anyone, Colleen takes an instant liking to Liz, mistaking her for Jack's actual fiancée, <a href="#Phoebe">Phoebe</a>.

<p>Colleen dies of a heart attack in "<a href="/wiki/My_Whole_Life_Is_Thunder" title="My Whole Life Is Thunder">My Whole Life Is Thunder</a>" during a visit to New York to spend time with Jack, attempting to guilt him and seemingly depriving him of her approval literally up to her last breath. Her last words to Jack are "I just want you to be happy," which Jack hears as "I just want you to be 'happy'" and takes as sarcasm and "one last twist of the knife." Jack and Liz subsequently discover in "<a href="/wiki/Florida_(30_Rock)" title="Florida (30 Rock)">Florida</a>" that Colleen spent her final years in a cohabitational lesbian relationship and - much more shockingly - was happy and well-liked in the couple's retirement community, where she was seen as kind and loving. Jack is sent into a tailspin by the revelation that his mother actually wanted him to be happy, which leads to him re-evaluating his life and career in the finale.</p>

<p><b>Milton Greene</b> (<a href="/wiki/Alan_Alda" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a>) is Jack's biological father. Milton rented a room from Colleen Donaghy in the Boston suburb of Sadchester in 1958, during one of Jimmy Donaghy's numerous abandonments of his family. The two soon engaged in coitus and, unbeknownst to Milton, begat Jack Donaghy.</p>
<p>A half-century later, Milton is a liberal professor at <a href="/wiki/Vermont" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Bennington_College" title="Bennington College">Bennington College</a>. In the interim, Milton had married and sired a son whom he and the child's mother refused to name, opining that children should chose their own names; Spider-Man Greene is Jack's unsuspecting half-brother. A fan of <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> (much to Jack's bemusement), Milton is writing a multi-volume biography of the former President, entitled <i>From Peanut to President</i>; <a href="/wiki/Betty_White" title="Betty White">Betty White</a> is reading a volume when Tracy Jordan telephones her in "<a href="/wiki/Stone_Mountain_(30_Rock)" title="Stone Mountain (30 Rock)">Stone Mountain</a>".</p>

He and Lenny Wozniak narrow his possible fathers down to three men whom Jack lures to Manhattan under false pretences in "<a href="/wiki/Mamma_Mia_(30_Rock)" title="Mamma Mia (30 Rock)">Mamma Mia</a>". Seeing that George Park is <a href="/wiki/Koreans" title="Koreans">Korean</a> and then learning that Fred O'Dwyer lost his genitals in a grenade explosion during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Jack invites Milton to his office and reveals their relation. Milton is overjoyed and announces that he is in need of a kidney to survive. In "<a href="/wiki/Kidney_Now!" title="Kidney Now!">Kidney Now!</a>", Jack is relieved to learn that he is not a match and decides to hold a charity concert to find a kidney for Milton. It is revealed in "<a href="/wiki/Christmas_Attack_Zone" title="Christmas Attack Zone">Christmas Attack Zone</a>" that <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Costello" title="Elvis Costello">Elvis Costello</a> was a tissue match and donated a kidney to Milton.</p>
<p>Milton's liberalism is exaggerated as a foil to Jack's conservative politics. He is kind, enthusiastic, and supportive of Jack.</p>

This is revealed to be a ploy: Verna has manipulated Jenna into forgiving her so she can pitch a reality show to Jack. Jack bribes Verna to pretend to be a caring mother; the act works, thrilling Jenna. As a running gag, Jenna and Verna have a habit of singing incestuously inappropriate duets.</p>

Mary Steenburgen portrays Diana Jessup, Avery's mother</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Diana Jessup</b> (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Steenburgen" title="Mary Steenburgen">Mary Steenburgen</a>) is Avery's mother and Jack's mother-in-law. Diana shares many of the same qualities with her daughter, which makes Jack instantly attracted to her. Diana is also extremely attracted to Jack. The two end up kissing at the opening of a fake Russian restaurant, but Liz covers for them, lying that Jack kisses everyone when he greets them. When Avery returns, Jack admits to Avery that he kissed Diana, but Avery forgives him, however, it is shown that there still is some tension between Avery and Diana due to the kiss. Despite their distant relationship, Diana truly loves and cares for her daughter, evidenced by her getting the United Nations involved in Avery's rescue, and her overseeing the making of a television film about Avery to make sure that the film portrays her daughter in a favorable light.</p>

Before Bev files her report, however, she sustains a head injury and forgets that she has conducted the evaluation. Liz gets the crew to help her "do over" the evaluation, hoping for a better result.</p>
<p>Although Liz's marriage to Criss was calculated to increase her chance at adopting, Bev explains that there remains a four-year waiting list for newborns and tries to convince Liz to adopt an older child. Liz eventually agrees after realising that years of dealing with her "problem children" Tracy and Jenna have proven her parenting skills. Bev subsequently convinces Liz to accept twins rather than a single child and schedules their arrival for a few short days later. She gets the date wrong, however, and informs Criss that Terry and Janet are flying in that afternoon.</p>
