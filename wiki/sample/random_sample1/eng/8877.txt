<p>As J Mullahey of Pan American Airways set about organizing the first Pacific area travel conference with the aim of promoting tourism to the largely undiscovered region of Asia Pacific.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting, Lorrin P. Thurstin noted, was to “discuss cooperation among Pacific countries that would result in a greater exchange of visitors to their mutual advantage, and to develop methods of presenting the Pacific area to the world’s travelers and the travel trade by reducing restrictions on Pacific travel, filling in accommodation gaps, and presenting the Pacific story in advertising and publicity”.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In March 1951, invitations were sent out for the conference, which was to be held in the first week of June, from the office of Hawaii's territorial governor, Ingram Stainback. Unfortunately many of the replies came in too late and the conference was postponed.</p>
<p>It was then in October 1951 that Thurstin, who was in Paris attending a European travel conference, issued his now-famous cable to Mullahey: "Proceed to send invitations to governments and carriers to attend Pacific Area Travel conference for purpose of establishing permanent Pacific Travel Association and determine most convenient date for majority during first three months 1952."</p>
<p>The inaugural conference eventually took place from January 10–15, 1952 at the Maluhia Auditorium of Fort DeRussy in Waikiki, Hawaii. There were 91 delegates in attendance at the conference, including representatives of government and business. Aside from Thurston and Mullahey, those taking a key role at this event were: Robert Allen, chairman of registration and housing; Melvin A. Conant, chairman of conference organisation; Harry Dove, chairman of counselor liaison; John Pugh, co-chairman of entertainment; John Jay Murphy, co-chairman of program and protocol; William O. Cogswell, Sam N. Mercer and Steward E. Fern of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, and Milton O. Holst of Holst &amp; Cummings, Lrd.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, January 15, 1952, Lorrin Thurston announced that 25 active and 12 allied members had signed the constitution and bylaws of what was now known as the Pacific Interim Travel Association (PITA). PITA was legally incorporated in the state of Hawaii two months later.</p>
<p>The new association’s constitution declared its purpose was “To encourage and assist in the development of the travel industries throughout the Pacific area”. While marketing activities were its primary goal, the delegates of the first conference also envisioned the association as one that could work with both government and private business in developing travel.</p>
<p>One of PATA’s main accomplishments in its first year was to publicise itself to the international travel community. The association’s first executive director Sam Mercer noted that the first conference “focused the attention of the entire travel world on an awakening of tourism in the Pacific”.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup> News articles and press releases were sent to, and subsequently published in, numerous publications – including both specialist travel press and general audience newspapers. A particularly effective vehicle for PITA’s self-promotion was its quarterly newspaper, PITA News Bulletin, which by the end of its first year was being sent to over 500 addresses throughout the world.</p>
<p>In its first year, PITA also worked with governments to ease entry and exit requirements for foreigners, seeing success in Japan, the US and the Philippines.</p>
<p>By the second conference in March 1953 (held in Hawaii like the first) PITA had increased its membership from 33 active and allied members to 49. It was also at this conference that it was decided to change the association’s name to the ‘Pacific Area Travel Association’ – or PATA.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1950s">1950s</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Asia_Travel_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: 1950s">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In 1953 PATA’s headquarters were moved from Hawaii to San Francisco, with Sam Mercer serving as the first executive director. Considered as the state of “money and influence”, San Francisco was home to an influential group of individuals who served on the PATA board and committees during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>Throughout the first decade, PATA membership grew steadily, attracting a wide range of members including governments, carriers, hotel members, travel agents, cruise lines and the media. Other members eventually included tour operators, educational institutions, vehicle operators, restaurants and catering services, advertising agencies, public relations firms, publications, banks and architectural and research firms.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1950s, PATA had 325 members, while there had also been a steady rise in the annual conference attendance. In 1955, a Research and Survey Committee was established and PATA delegates gave their approval to spend US$8,000 on the organisation’s first advertising programme. In 1957 the first issue of Pacific Travel News (PTN) was published, providing PATA with a news vehicle to promote itself and its destinations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1960s">1960s</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Asia_Travel_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: 1960s">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In 1958, PATA's Board of Directors requested that the US International Cooperation Administration provide US $150,000 for a comprehensive study of the Pacific countries. The results of the survey, which became known as the 'Checchi Report', were presented at the 1962 Annual Conference. It presented to PATA members and NTOs the status of tourism in the Pacific region, both area-wide and individually by country. It contained information regarding the anticipated impact of tourist expenditure, the effects of tourism on jobs and wages, methods of financing tourism development and projections for US visitor arrivals to the Pacific region. The report quickly became a blueprint for many NTO and travel planners, as it methodically presented the economic benefits – both direct and indirect – derived from tourism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>1961 saw the establishment of the first PATA Chapters in New Zealand and Hong Kong. The development of the chapter system was an effort to involve professionals in the travel and tourism industry who could not participate in PATA’s activities or attend annual conference and workshops, and to expand PATA’s presence in previously untapped markets.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1960s also witnessed PATA's first move towards promoting education and training, helping to set up the <a class="external text" href="http://www.tim.hawaii.edu/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">School of TIM</a> (Tourism Industry Management) at the University of Hawaii – the first such institution to be established in the region.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1970s">1970s</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Asia_Travel_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: 1970s">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>At the 23rd Annual Conference, held in Jakarta in 1974, it was decided that there should be a change of emphasis in PATA's function to enable more support for the developmental aspects of tourism within the Pacific area, particularly in industry, education and training.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-6"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup> Members stipulated that a new, permanent body be formed, with the name 'Development Authority'. This advisory body would be composed of experts from diverse backgrounds and specialisations, whose purpose would be to carry out the association's intentions towards heritage conservation, education and training, and environmental enhancement.</p>
<p>At its second meeting in August 1974, the newly formed Development Authority accepted its first assignment. It followed a request from Lieutenant General Chalermchai Charuvastr, Director General of the Tourist Organisation of Thailand (TOT), to PATA executive director Marvin Plake to help increase tourism in Thailand. The TOT Director General proposed <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Mai" title="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a> as an ideal location for the development of tourism and so PATA sent a travel trade mission - or 'task force' as they later became known - to the northern city. The task force completed its mission in February 1975. Its report "Chiang Mai: A Program or Expanding the Airport" contained a two-stage list of recommendations and addressed the areas of sight-seeing attractions, marketing, air service, air cargo, airport development, community relations and statistical record-keeping.</p>
<p>The years following the task force saw visitor arrivals to Chiang Mai increase, however there was still a relatively poor showing in foreign arrivals. PATA dispatched a second task force team to the city in 1977 where, amongst other issues, they considered the economics of international air service there. Their report "Chiang Mai, The Introduction of International Air Service", contained both short and long-term recommendations which were submitted to TOT. The Thai government later implemented a development plan for Chiang Mai largely based on PATA's blueprint.</p>
<p>The 1970s also saw the first ever PATA Travel Mart in Manila (1978). The highly successful and popular event was the brainchild of then-PATA Staff Vice President Gerald Picolla, who saw the potential of such marts to generate huge volumes of business for participating member organisations at a fraction of the cost of doing business on the road.</p>

<p>In 1984 the PATA Board of Directors approved the creation of the <a class="external text" href="http://www.pata.org/PATA-Foundation" rel="nofollow">PATA Foundation</a>, creating a new role for the association as a benefactor of culture and heritage policy by administering project funding. Under the leadership of its first chair, George Howling, the foundation began securing funds for education, research and heritage conservation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Story_of_PATA_1-7"><a href="#cite_note-Story_of_PATA-1">[1]</a></sup> The foundation sought assistance from PATA Chapters in carrying out is work, including the production of professional papers on handicraft preservation, area-wide inventories of heritage assets, and conservation programs for endangered wildlife. At first larger projects were targeted, but the focus then turned to small projects as it enabled the foundation to distribute its assistance more efficiently and effectively. For example, in 1988, the foundation funded the inventory and architectural record-keeping of historic buildings for a historic district preservation project in Pokhara, Nepal.</p>
<p>1986 saw PATA change its name from Pacific Area Travel Association to Pacific Asia Travel Association to reflect the ever-increasing importance of Asia in commerce and world affairs.</p>
<p>The first World Chapters Congress in 1989 attracted 250 delegates from 58 chapters with ‘Teamwork Toward Success’ as the theme.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1990s">1990s</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Asia_Travel_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: 1990s">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>With tourism to PATA member countries booming, concerns began to grow about environmental, cultural and heritage preservation. At the 1991 Annual Conference in Bali, PATA's 40th, there was a call from over 1,500 delegates from more than 50 countries to promote ecologically responsible travel and tourism under the conference theme 'Enrich the Environment'. This occasion marked the beginning of PATA's role as an 'authoritative' voice for sustainable tourism in the Pacific Asia region and in January 1992, the PATA Board of Directors approved the PATA 'Code for Environmentally Responsible Tourism' and it was officially adopted at the Annual Conference in Hong Kong later that same year.</p>
<p>1992: PATA publication: Endemic Tourism: A profitable industry in a sustainable environment. ‘The tourism industry must be profitable and environmentally sustainable if it is to provide long-term benefits, but this will not be achieved without a new and different approach to industry planning and development.’</p>
<p>1992: After intense discussions and negotiations, the <a class="external text" href="http://en.cnta.gov.cn/" rel="nofollow">China National Tourism Administration</a> (CNTA) joined PATA as a government member</p>
<p>1993: <a class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=P02lAAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y" rel="nofollow">PATA/WTO Human Resources for Tourism Conference</a> : 4–6 October 1993, Bali, Indonesia</p>
<p>1994: Lahore, Pakistan: PATA Adventure Travel and Ecotourism Conference.</p>
<p>Further environmental efforts came in 1994, when PATA's Green Leaf program was launched, with the aim of encouraging members to incorporate CERT (Code for Environmentally Responsible Tourism) into their operations. It became a centerpiece of PATA’s initiatives in the area of sustainable tourism, but was later integrated into the WTTC-run <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Green_Globe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Green Globe (page does not exist)">Green Globe</a> programme in 2000.</p>
<p>1996: Pokara, Nepal: PATA Adventure Travel and Ecotourism Conference.</p>
<p>Following the Gulf War, PATA created the Accelerated Marketing Program (AMP), designed to support member destinations affected by conflict.</p>
<p>The end of the decade - 1998 - saw PATA relocated its head office from San Francisco to Bangkok to be in the heart of its membership region.</p>

<p>In 2003 PATA launches Project Phoenix, a global consumer communications campaign to re-invigorate travel and tourism in Pacific Asia. It came in response to the battering the travel industry and economies in the region had taken due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Bali bombs and SARS. This year also saw PATA adopt the ‘Allied Partner’ concept, inviting local, regional and national tourist bodies outside PATA’s geographic region to gain access to Asia Pacific’s outbound markets.</p>
<p>2004 saw PATA change its Mission Statement to include tourism ‘to, from and within’ Asia Pacific, thereby recognizing the importance of the region as a growing outbound market.</p>
<p>Following the December 2004 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indian_Ocean_Tsunami" title="Indian Ocean Tsunami">Indian Ocean Tsunami</a>, PATA launches a relief fund.</p>

Driven by the leadership of the Sustainable Tourism Committee, the 2006 PATA AGM accepted a new Mission Statement for PATA, which for the first time, embodies the concepts of 'responsible development' and 'sustainable growth' of tourism in the region. It now reads:
</pre>
<p>'The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) is a membership association acting as a catalyst for the responsible development of the Asia Pacific travel and tourism industry. In partnership with PATA’s private and public sector members, we enhance the sustainable growth, value and quality of travel and tourism to, from and within the region’.</p>

The objective of PATAmPOWER is to be your one stop for data about the Asia Pacific visitor economy, improving productivity, providing faster insights and enabling smarter decisions.</p>
<p>In 2013, PATA appoints a Corporate Social Responsibility specialist who facilitates signing of MOU with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, the international body fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices by destinations and tourism enterprises.</p>
<p>In 2013 PATA helped to align industry advocacy with other travel and tourism industry bodies, formally launching the Global Travel Association Coalition (GTAC). PATA is a founding member of this global group which also includes Airports Council International (ACI), Cruise Line International Association (CLIA), International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), World Economic Forum (WEF), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council.</p>

<p>On December 2014 PATA launched the monthly Connected Visitor Economy Bulletin, making it free to both members and non-members. The Connected Visitor Economy Bulletin is produced on a monthly basis and covers trends and developments across the Asia Pacific region.

<p>On February 17, 2015, the Tourism Industry Association New Zealand (TIA) and PATA sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that focuses on four main areas of co-operation: the sharing of information and insight, support for collective policy and advocacy positions, industry connectivity, and collaboration on mutual events.</p>
<p>On March 4, 2015, PATA launched its new microsite, sustain.pata.org. The site, a new online tool for information on sustainable and socially responsible travel and tourism issues, is supported in part by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development BMZ, implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, and by EarthCheck.</p>
<p>On May 4, 2015, in response to the earthquake that killed and injured thousands of people and devastated much of Kathmandu’s tourism infrastructure nine days earlier, the PATA Foundation established a Nepal Earthquake Tourism Recovery Fund to assist the PATA Nepal Chapter in its tourism industry recovery efforts.</p>
<p>On May 27, 2015, PATA, in partnership with TripAdvisor, launched the PATA CEO Challenge to help promote uniqueness and diversity of heritage, culture, customs and natural beauty of the world’s many diverse destinations.

<p>On June 24, 2015 PATA and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) created a new partnership, in the form of a memorandum of understanding (MoU), recognising the positive impacts that their collaboration can have in the areas of conservation and sustainable development. The specific objectives of the MoU include collaboration in capacity building, knowledge sharing, and networking, both online and in person. PATA members may now increase their knowledge of wider sustainability issues, particularly in relation to Mangroves for the Future (MFF) and coastal tourism, as well as IUCN case studies showcasing positive examples of sustainable tourism on PATA’s sustainability website, sustain.pata.org.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2015 PATA forged an organisational partnership with the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA). The agreement strengthens the bond and shared interests between the two associations. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by PATA CEO Mario Hardy and IGLTA President/CEO John Tanzella at World Travel Market in London, United Kingdom on Thursday November 5, 2015.
