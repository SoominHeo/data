The etymology of the name Skaði is uncertain, but may be connected with the original form of Scandinavia.
Some place names in Scandinavia, particularly in Sweden, refer to Skaði.
Scholars have theorized a potential connection between Skaði and the god Ullr , a particular relationship with the jötunn Loki, and that Scandinavia may be related to the name Skaði  or the name may be connected to an Old Norse noun meaning "harm".
